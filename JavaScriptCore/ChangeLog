        Qt/Windows build fix. The externally declared hash tables are actually
        declared const and the const is mangled in the symbol name, so when
        importing they also need to be marked const.

        When compiling without MULTIPLE_THREADS use a const HashTable&
        instead of a HashTable& in ThreadClassInfoHashTables to avoid
        initializing the latter with a const reference.

        - fix <rdar://problem/5657459> REGRESSION: JavaScriptCore no longer builds with
          GCC 4.2 due to pointer aliasing warnings

        Fix this by removing the HashTable optimizations that allowed us to share a back end
        implementation between hash tables with integers, pointers, RefPtr, and String objects
        as keys. The way it worked was incompatible with strict aliasing.

        This increases code size. On Mac OS X we'll have to regenerate .order files to avoid
        slowing down Safari startup times.

        This creates a slight slowdown in SunSpider, mitigated by the following four speedups:

        - speed up array put slightly by moving a branch (was already done for get)

        - speed up symbol table access by adding a function named inlineGet to HashMap
          and using that in symbolTableGet/Put

        - speed up PropertyNameArray creation by reducing the amount of reference count
          churn and uniqueness checking when adding names and not doing any allocation at
          all when building small arrays

        - speed up conversion of strings to floating point numbers by eliminating the
          malloc/free of the buffer for the ASCII copy of the string; a way to make
          things even faster would be to change strtod to take a UTF-16 string

        Note that there is considerable unused complexity now in HashSet/Map/Table to support
        "storage types", which is no longer used. Will do in a separate patch.

        * API/JSCallbackObjectFunctions.h:
        (KJS::JSCallbackObject<Base>::getPropertyNames): Removed explicit cast to Identifier to
        take advantage of the new PropertyNameArray::add overload and avoid reference count churn.
        * API/JSObjectRef.cpp:
        (JSPropertyNameAccumulatorAddName): Ditto.
        * JavaScriptCore.exp: Updated PropertyNameArray::add entry point name.

        * kjs/JSVariableObject.cpp: Removed now-unneeded IdentifierRepHashTraits::nullRepPtr
        definition (see below).
        (KJS::JSVariableObject::getPropertyNames): Removed explicit cast to Identifier.

        * kjs/JSVariableObject.h:
        (KJS::JSVariableObject::symbolTableGet): Use inlineGet for speed. Also changed to do
        early exit instead of nesting the body inside an if.
        (KJS::JSVariableObject::symbolTablePut): Ditto.

        * kjs/PropertyNameArray.cpp:
        (KJS::PropertyNameArray::add): Changed implementation to take a raw pointer instead of
        a reference to an identifier. Do uniqueness checking by searching the vector when the
        vector is short, only building the set once the vector is large enough.

        * kjs/PropertyNameArray.h: Added an overload of add for a raw pointer, and made the old
        add function call that one. Added an addKnownUnique function for use when the new
        name is known to be different from any other in the array. Changed the vector to have
        an inline capacity of 20.

        * kjs/SymbolTable.h: Changed IdentifierRepHash to inherit from the default hash for
        a RefPtr so we don't have to define so much. Added an overload of the hash function for
        a raw pointer as required by the new RefPtrHashMap. Got rid of the now-unneeded
        IdentifierRepHashTraits -- the default traits now work fine. Added a definition of
        empthValueIsZero to SymbolTableIndexHashTraits; not having it was incorrect, but harmless.

        * kjs/array_instance.cpp:
        (KJS::ArrayInstance::put): Move the maxArrayIndex check inside the branch that checks
        the index against the length, as done in the get function.

        * kjs/function.cpp:
        (KJS::globalFuncKJSPrint): Changed to use the new getCString instead of cstring.

        * kjs/internal.cpp: Removed printInfo debugging function, a client of cstring.

        used this one in a long time.
        * kjs/internal.h: Ditto.

        * kjs/object.cpp:
        (KJS::JSObject::getPropertyNames): Removed explicit cast to Identifier.
        * kjs/property_map.cpp:
        (KJS::PropertyMap::getEnumerablePropertyNames): Ditto. Also added a special case for
        the case where the propertyNames array is empty -- in that case we know we're adding
        a set of names that are non-overlapping so we can use addKnownUnique.
        * kjs/ustring.cpp:
        (KJS::UString::getCString): Replaces cstring. Puts the C string into a CStringBuffer,
        which is a char Vector with an inline capacity. Also returns a boolean to indicate if
        the converion was lossy, which eliminates the need for a separate is8Bit call.
        (KJS::UString::toDouble): Changed to call getCString instead of cstring.
        * kjs/ustring.h: Ditto.

        * wtf/HashFunctions.h: Overload the hash and equal functions for RefPtr's default
        hash to take raw pointers. This works with the changes to RefPtrHashMap to avoid
        introducing refcount churn.

        * wtf/HashMap.h: Removed special code to convert the deleted value to the empty value
        when writing a new value into the map. This is now handled elsewhere.
        (WTF::HashMap::get): Removed code that checks for an empty hash table before calling
        HashTable::lookup; it's slightly more efficient to do this check inside lookup.

        * wtf/HashTable.h:
        (WTF::HashTable::isDeletedBucket): Changed to use isDeletedValue instead of using
        deletedValue and the equality operator.
        (WTF::HashTable::deleteBucket): Changed to use constructDeletedValue instead of
        using deletedValue and the assignment operator.
        (WTF::HashTable::checkKey): Added. Factors out the check for values that are empty
        or deleted keys that's used in various functions below.
        (WTF::HashTable::lookup): Changed to use checkKey, check for a 0 table, and also
        made public for use by RefPtrHashMap.
        (WTF::HashTable::lookupForWriting): Changed to use checkKey.
        (WTF::HashTable::fullLookupForWriting): Changed to use checkKey.
        (WTF::HashTable::add): Changed to use checkKey, and call initializeBucket on a

        (WTF::HashTable::addPassingHashCode): Ditto.
        (WTF::HashTable::deallocateTable): Check isDeletedBucket before calling ~ValueType.

        * wtf/HashTraits.h: Got ridd of all the HashTraits specialization for the integer
        types, since GeneicHashTraitsBase already deals with integers separately. Put the
        deleted value support into GenericHashTraitsBase. Changed FloatHashTraits to
        inherit from GenericHashTraits, and define construct/isDeletedValue rather than
        deletedValue. Removed the ref and deref functions from RefPtr's HashTraits, and
        defined construct/isDeletedValue. Eliminated DeletedValueAssigner. Changed
        PairHashTraits to define construct/isDeletedValue, and also merged
        PairBaseHashTraits in with PairHashTraits. Got rid of all specialization of
        HashKeyStorageTraits. We'll remove that, and the needsRef data member, later.

        * wtf/RefPtr.h: Added HashTableDeletedValueType, an enum type with a single value,
        HashTableDeletedValue. Used that type to make a new constructor to construct
        deleted values and also added an isHashTableDeletedValue function.

        * wtf/RefPtrHashMap.h: Added RefPtrHashMapRawKeyTranslator and used it to implement
        the raw pointer functions. This is a way to continue to avoid refcount thrash. We
        can't use the old way because it depended on the underlying map using a non-RefPtr
        type.

        Fix leaks during plugin tests (which actually excercise background JS), and potential
        PAC brokenness that was not reported, but very likely.

        The leaks shadowed a bigger problem with Identifier destruction. Identifier::remove involves
        an IdentifierTable lookup, which is now a per-thread instance. Since garbage collection can
        currently happen on a different thread than allocation, a wrong table was used.

        No measurable change on SunSpider total, ~1% variation on individual tests.

        Replaced isIdentifier with a pointer to IdentifierTable, so that destruction can be done
        correctly. Took one bit from reportedCost, to avoid making UString::Rep larger (performance

        (KJS::IdentifierTable::remove):
        Make IdentifierTable a real class. Its destructor needs to zero out outstanding references,
        because some identifiers may briefly outlive it during thread destruction, and we don't want
        them to use their stale pointers.

        (KJS::LiteralIdentifierTable):
        (KJS::Identifier::add):
        Now that LiteralIdentifierTable is per-thread and can be destroyed not just during application

        the table to hold RefPtrs.

        - To keep the behavior of the WebKit and JavaScriptCore API's the same,
          we need to hide the fact that the global object and the window object

          navigations.  To do this, only the wrapper should ever be exposed.  This
          fixes the two remaining spots where the internal global object is exposed,

        Fix compilation with Qt namespaces

        Qt can be configured to have all of its classes inside a specified namespaces.
        This is for example used in plugin/component environments like Eclipse.

        This change makes it possible to let the Qt port compile against a namespaced
        Qt by the use of macros Qt provides to properly forward declare Qt classes in
        the namespace.

        Bug 18367: Crash during celtic kane js speed 2007 test

        GCC 4.2 on x86_64 Linux decided to reorder the local variables in markCurrentThreadConservatively's
        stack frame.  This lead to the range of addresses the collector treated as stack to exclude the
        contents of volatile registers that markCurrentThreadConservatively forces onto the stack.  This was
        leading to objects being prematurely collected if the only reference to them was via a register at
        the time a collection occurred.

        The fix for this is to move the calculation of the top of the stack into a NEVER_INLINE function
        that is called from markCurrentThreadConservatively.  This forces the dummy variable we use for
        determining the top of stack to be in a different stack frame which prevents the compiler from
        reordering it relative to the registers that markCurrentThreadConservatively forces onto the stack.

        (WTF::VectorBuffer::allocateBuffer): Made VectorBuffer with inline
        capacity aware that calls to allocateBuffer might be shrinks, rather
        than grows, so we shouldn't allocate a new buffer on the heap unless

        (WTF::::shrinkCapacity): Call resize() instead of just setting m_size,
        so destructors run. Call resize before reallocating the buffer to make
        sure that we still have access to the objects we need to destroy. Call
        moveOverlapping instead of move, since a call to allocateBuffer on an
        inline buffer may produce identical storage.

        Adding new functionality to Vector. Currently all of the shrink and

        possible, though, it is necessary to be able to shrink the capacity 
        as well. So this patch adds that functionality.

        Fixed <rdar://problem/5689093> Stricter (ES4) eval semantics
        
        The basic rule is:
        
        - "eval(s)" is treated as an operator that gives the ES3 eval behavior.
            ... but only if there is no overriding declaration of "eval" in scope.
        - All other invocations treat eval as a function that evaluates a
        script in the context of its "this" object.
            ... but if its "this" object is not the global object it was
            originally associated with, eval throws an exception.
        
        Because only expressions of the form "eval(s)" have access to local
        scope, the compiler can now statically determine whether a function
        needs local scope to be dynamic.

        Fix for <rdar://problem/5778247> - Reproducible crash on storage/execute-sql-args.html

        DatabaseThread::unscheduleDatabaseTasks() manually filters through a MessageQueue,
        removing particular items for Databases that were shutting down.

        This filtering operation is not atomic, and therefore causes a race condition with the
        MessageQueue waking up and reading from the message queue.  

        The end result was an attempt to dereference a null DatabaseTask.  Timing-wise, this never
        seemed to happen in a debug build, otherwise an assertion would've caught it.  Replacing that
        assertion with a crash in a release build is what revealed this bug.

        Partial fix for <rdar://problem/5744037> Gmail out of memory (17455)
        
        I'm removing KJS_MEM_LIMIT for the following reasons:
        
        - We have a few reports of KJS_MEM_LIMIT breaking important web
        applications, like GMail and Google Reader. (For example, if you
        simply open 12 GMail tabs, tab #12 will hit the limit.)

        - Firefox has no discernable JS object count limit, so any limit, even
        a large one, is a potential compatibility problem.
        
        - KJS_MEM_LIMIT does not protect against malicious memory allocation,
        since there are many ways to maliciously allocate memory without
        increasing the JS object count.
        
        - KJS_MEM_LIMIT is already mostly broken, since it only aborts the
        script that breaches the limit, not any subsequent scripts.
        
        - We've never gotten bug reports about websites that would have
        benefited from an unbroken KJS_MEM_LIMIT. The initial check-in of
        KJS_MEM_LIMIT (KJS revision 80061) doesn't mention a website that
        needed it.
        
        - Any website that brings you anywhere close to crashing due to the
        number of live JS objects will almost certainly put up the "slow
        script" dialog at least 20 times beforehand.

        Geoff's theory is that the slowdown was due to copying hash tables when

        should fix the problem.

        (According to Geoff's measurements, in a PLT that exaggerates the

        * kjs/property_map.h: Changed SavedProperty from a struct to a class. Set it up so
        it does not get initialized at construction time to avoid initializing twice when

          Incorrect Function.toString behaviour with read/modify/write operators performed on negative numbers

        Test: fast/js/function-toString-parentheses.html

        The problem here was that a NumberNode with a negative number in it had the wrong
        precedence. It's not a primary expression, it's a unary operator with a primary
        expression after it.

        Once the precedence of NumberNode was fixed, the cases from bug 17020 were also
        fixed without trying to treat bracket nodes like dot nodes. That wasn't needed.
        The reason we handle numbers before dot nodes specially is that the dot is a
        legal character in a number. The same is not true of a bracket. Eventually we
        could get smarter, and only add the parentheses when there is actual ambiguity.
        There is none if the string form of the number already has a dot in it, or if
        it's a number with a alphabetic name like infinity or NAN.

        * kjs/nodes.h: Renamed back from ObjectAccess to DotExpr.

        (KJS::ExecState::lexicalGlobalObject): Removed unneeded special case for

        directly rather than calling functions.

        class constructor.
        (KJS::GlobalExecState::~GlobalExecState): Added.
        (KJS::InterpreterExecState::InterpreterExecState): Added. Moved code to

        (KJS::JSGlobalObject::tearOffActivation): Got rid of unneeded static_cast
        (I think I mentioned this during patch review) and used an early exit so that
        the entire contents of the function aren't nested inside an if statement.

        IE DOM style JS).
        * Add support for custom toString methods.
        
        * Fine tune some bindings to be closer to QtScript.
        Make void functions return undefined, and empty/
        null QStrings return a zero length string.
        
        * Create framework for allowing more direct method calls.
        Since RuntimeMethod doesn't allow us to add additional
        methods/properties to a function, add these classes.
        Start prototyping object.signal.connect(...).
        
        * Add signal support to the Qt bindings.
        Allow connecting to signals (object.signal.connect(slot)),
        disconnecting, and emitting signals.  Currently chooses
        the first signal that matches the name, so this will need
        improvement.
        
        * Add property names, and resolve signals closer to use.
        Enumerating properties now returns some of the Qt properties
        and signals.  Slots and methods aren't quite present.  Also,
        resolve signal connections etc. closer to the time of use, so
        we can do more dynamic resolution based on argument type etc.
        Still picks the first one with the same name, at the moment.
        
        * Make signature comparison code consistent.
        Use the same code for checking meta signatures in
        the method and fallback getters, and avoid a
        QByteArray construction when we can.
        
        * Fix minor memory leak, and handle pointers better.
        Delete the private object in the dtors, and use RefPtrs
        for holding Instances etc.
        
        * Handle method lookup better.
        Allow invocation time method lookup based on the arguments,
        which is closer to QtScript behaviour.  Also, cache the
        method lists and delete them in the QtClass dtor (stops
        a memory leak).
        
        * Improve JS to Qt data type conversions.
        Add some support for Date & RegExp JS objects,
        and provide some metrics on the quality of the
        conversion.
        
        * A couple of fixes for autotest failures.
        Better support for converting lists, read/write only
        QMetaProperty support, modified slot search order...)

        Fix <rdar://problem/5595552> r27608 introduced a 20% increase in JS binary size, 4% increase in WebCore binary size

        - This changes the way JS functions that use Lookup tables are handled.  Instead of using
          one class per function, which allowed specialization of the virtual callAsFunction
          method, we now use one class, PrototypeFunction, which takes a pointer to a static
          function to use as the implementation.  This significantly decreases the binary size
          of JavaScriptCore (about 145k on an Intel only build) while still keeping some of the
          speedup r27608 garnered (SunSpider says this is 1.005x as slow, which should leave some
          wiggle room from the original 1% speedup) and keeps the functions implementations in separate
          functions to help with optimizations.

        Add binding language type to Instance.
        Allows runtime determination of the type of an
        Instance, to allow safe casting.  Doesn't actually
        add any safe casting yet, though.

        Add a helper function to get an Instance from a JSObject*.
        Given an object and the expected binding language, see if
        the JSObject actually wraps an Instance of the given type
        and return it.  Otherwise return 0.

        Move RuntimeObjectImp creations into Instance.
        Make the ctor protected, and Instance a friend class, so
        that all creation of RuntimeObjectImps goes through
        one place.

        Remove copy ctor/assignment operator for QtInstance.
        Instance itself is Noncopyable, so QtInstance doesn't
        need to have these.

        Add caching for QtInstance and associated RuntimeObjectImps.
        Push any dealings with QtLanguage bindings into QtInstance,
        and cache them there, rather than in the Instance layer.  Add
        a QtRuntimeObjectImp to help with caching.

        This bug was caused by var declarations shadowing built-in properties of

        To match Firefox, we've decided that var declarations will never shadow
        built-in properties of the global object or its prototypes. We used to
        behave more like IE, which allows shadowing, but walking that line got

        a binary first.  Only the Xcode build was able to be tested.

          <rdar://problem/5675331> REGRESSION(r29266): Reproducible crash in fast/replaced/image-map.html

        The crash resulted from a native object (DumpRenderTree's
        EventSender) causing its wrapper to be invalidated (by clicking a
        link that replaced the document in the window) and consequently
        deallocated. The fix is to use RefPtrs to protect the native object
        from deletion by self-invalidation.

        - fix alignment problem with NaN and Inf globals

        * kjs/fpconst.cpp: Move the contents of this file from here back to
        value.cpp. The reason this was in a separate file is that the DARWIN
        version of this used a declaration of the globals with a different
        type to avoid creating "init routines". That's no longer necessary for
        DARWIN and was never necessary for the non-DARWIN code path.
        To make this patch easy to merge, I didn't actually delete this file
        yet. We'll do that in a separate changeset.

        * kjs/value.cpp: If C99's NAN and INFINITY are present, then use them,
        othrewise use the union trick from fpconst.cpp. I think it would be
        better to eliminate KJS::NaN and KJS::Inf and just use NAN and INFINITY
        directly or std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_nan() and
        std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity(). But when I tried that, it
        slowed down SunSpider. Someone else could do that cleanup if they
        could do it without slowing down the engine.

        Unfortunately, restoring this stack causes the regular expression test in SunSpider

          speed up function calls by making ScopeChain::push cheaper

        This gives a 1.019x speedup on SunSpider.

        After doing this, I realized this probably will be obsolete when the optimization
        to avoid creating an activation object is done. When we do that one we should check
        if rolling this out will speed things up, since this does add overhead at the time
        you copy the scope chain.

        No idea why it was in this header file!

        function that takes another ScopeChain. It was unused. I think we used

        and moved the refCount into a derived struct, ScopeChainHeapNode. Made _node
        mutable so it can be changed in the moveToHeap function. Changed the copy
        constructor and assignment operator to call moveToHeap, since the top node
        can't be shared when it's embedded in another ScopeChain object. Updated

        - Assignment expressions get properly optimized for local variables
        
        This patch also includes some code cleanup:
        - Most of the old VarStatement/VarDecl logic is now only used for const declarations,

        AST optimization: Avoid NULL-checking ForNode's child nodes.
        
        0.6% speedup on SunSpider.
        
        This is a proof of concept patch that demonstrates how to optimize
        grammar productions with optional components, like
        
            for (optional; optional; optional) {
                ...
            }
            
        The parser emits NULL for an optional component that is not present.

        Instead of checking for a NULL child at execution time, a node that
        expects an optional component to be present more often than not checks
        for a NULL child at construction time, and substitutes a viable
        alternative node in its place.

        (We'd like the parser to start emitting NULL a lot more once we teach
        it to emit NULL for certain no-op productions like EmptyStatement and
        VariableStatement, so, as a foundation, it's important for nodes with
        NULL optional components to be fast.)

        (KJS::Parser::didFinishParsing): Check for NULL SourceElements. Also,
        moved didFinishParsing into the .cpp file because adding a branch while

        * kjs/nodes.h:
        (KJS::ForNode::): Check for NULL SourceElements. Substitute a TrueNode
        because it's semantically harmless, and it evaluates to boolean in an

        Stop using completions in the execution engine.
        Instead, the completion type and label target are both
        stored in the ExecState.

        * API/JSContextRef.cpp: Removed unneeded include of "completion.h".
        * bindings/runtime_method.cpp: Removed unused execute function.
        * bindings/runtime_method.h: Ditto.

        * kjs/ExecState.h: Added completionType, breakOrContinueTarget,

        setContinueCompletion, setReturnValueCompletion, setThrowCompletion,
        setInterruptedCompletion, m_completionType, and m_breakOrContinueTarget.

        * kjs/completion.h: Removed constructor and getter for target
        for break and continue from Completion. This class is now only
        used for the public API to Interpreter and such.

        * kjs/date_object.h: Removed unused execute function.

        * kjs/function.cpp:
        (KJS::FunctionImp::callAsFunction): Removed some unneeded
        exception processing. Updated to call the new execute function
        and to get the completion type from the ExecState. Merged in
        the execute function, which repeated some of the same logic and
        was called only from here.
        (KJS::GlobalFuncImp::callAsFunction): More of the same for eval.

        Optimized global access to global variables, using a symbol table.
        
        SunSpider reports a 1.5% overall speedup, a 6.2% speedup on 3d-morph,
        and a whopping 33.1% speedup on bitops-bitwise-and.

        * API/JSCallbackObjectFunctions.h: Replaced calls to JSObject:: with
        calls to Base::, since JSObject is not always our base class. This
        was always a bug, but the bug is even more apparent after some of my
        changes.

        (KJS::::staticFunctionGetter): Replaced use of getDirect with call to
        getOwnPropertySlot. Global declarations are no longer stored in the
        property map, so a call to getDirect is insufficient for finding
        override properties.

        * API/testapi.c: 
        * API/testapi.js: Added test for the getDirect change mentioned above.

        * kjs/ExecState.cpp: 
        * kjs/ExecState.h: Dialed back the optimization to store a direct
        pointer to the localStorage buffer. One ExecState can grow the global
        object's localStorage without another ExecState's knowledge, so
        ExecState can't store a direct pointer to the localStorage buffer
        unless/until we invent a way to update all the relevant ExecStates.

        * kjs/JSGlobalObject.cpp: Inserted the symbol table into get and put
        operations.
        (KJS::JSGlobalObject::reset): Reset the symbol table and local storage,

        * kjs/function.cpp:
        (KJS::GlobalFuncImp::callAsFunction): Renamed progNode to evalNode
        because it's an EvalNode, not a ProgramNode.

        * kjs/lookup.h:
        (KJS::cacheGlobalObject): Replaced put with faster putDirect, since
        that's how the rest of lookup.h works. putDirect is safe here because
        cacheGlobalObject is only used for objects whose names are not valid
        identifiers.

        * kjs/nodes.cpp: The good stuff!

        (KJS::EvalNode::processDeclarations): Replaced hasProperty with
        the new hasOwnProperty, which is slightly faster.

        * kjs/object.h: Nixed clearProperties because clear() does this job now.

        Instead of finding declarations in a pass following the initial parsing of
        a program, we incorporate the logic directly into the parser.  This lays
        the groundwork for further optimisations (such as improving performance in

        in addition to providing a 0.4% performance improvement in SunSpider.

        UString::Rep*. With globals, the symbol table can outlast the

        REGRESSION: 303-304: Embedded YouTube video fails to render- JS errors (16150) (Flash 9)
        
        Get rid of unnecessary and incorrect security checks for plug-ins accessing JavaScript objects. 
        
        The way this used to work was that each NPObject that wrapped a JSObject would have a root object
        corresponding to the frame object (used for managing the lifecycle) and an origin root object (used for
        doing security checks). 
        
        This would prevent a plug-in from accessing a frame's window object if it's security origin was different
        (some parts of the window, such as the location object, can be accessed from frames with different security 
        origins, and those checks are being done in WebCore).
        
        Also, if a plug-in were to access a window object of a frame that later went away, it could lead to that
        Window JSObject being garbage collected and the NPObject pointing to freed memory.
        
        How this works now is that there is no origin root object anymore, and all NPObject wrappers that are created
        for a plug-in will have the root object of the containing frame of that plug-in.

        Make the JS collector work with multiple threads 

        Under heavy contention it was possible the GC to suspend other
        threads inside the pthread spinlock, which could lead to the GC
        thread blocking on the pthread spinlock itself.

        We now determine and store each thread's stack base when it is
        registered, thus removing the need for any calls to pthread_get_stackaddr_np
        that needed the pthread spinlock.

        2. Turned Parser into a singleton. Cleaned up Lexer's singleton

        respecting the arguments passed to them. (No behavior change, but this
        problem could have caused serious problems for an unsuspecting user of

        Cleaned up the JavaScript grammar a bit.
        
        1. Changed BlockNode to always hold a child vector (which may be empty),
        eliminating a few NULL-check branches in the common execution case.
        
        2. Changed the Block production to correctly report its starting and 
        ending line numbers to the debugger. (It used to report its ending line
        as its starting line.) Also, removed duplicate line-reporting code
        inside the BlockNode constructor.
        
        3. Moved curly braces up from FunctionBody production into parent
        productions. (I had to move the line number reporting code, too, since
        it depends on the location of the curly braces.) This matches the ECMA
        spec more closely, and makes some future changes I plan easier.
        
        4. Fixed statementList* convenience functions to deal appropriately with
        empty Vectors.

        SunSpider reports a small and statistically insignificant speedup.

        - fix http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11231
          RegExp bug when handling newline characters
          and a number of other differences between PCRE behvior
          and JavaScript regular expressions:

          + single-digit sequences like \4 should be treated as octal
            character constants, unless there is a sufficient number
            of brackets for them to be treated as backreferences

          + \8 turns into the character "8", not a binary zero character
            followed by "8" (same for 9)

          + only the first 3 digits should be considered part of an
            octal character constant (the old behavior was to decode
            an arbitrarily long sequence and then mask with 0xFF)

          + if \x is followed by anything other than two valid hex digits,
            then it should simply be treated a the letter "x"; that includes
            not supporting the \x{41} syntax

          + if \u is followed by anything less than four valid hex digits,
            then it should simply be treated a the letter "u"

          + an extra "+" should be a syntax error, rather than being treated
            as the "possessive quantifier"

          + if a "]" character appears immediately after a "[" character that
            starts a character class, then that's an empty character class,
            rather than being the start of a character class that includes a
            "]" character

          + a "$" should not match a terminating newline; we could have gotten
            PCRE to handle this the way we wanted by passing an appropriate option

        Test: fast/js/regexp-no-extensions.html

        * pcre/pcre_compile.cpp:
        (check_escape): Check backreferences against bracount to catch both
        overflows and things that should be treated as octal. Rewrite octal
        loop to not go on indefinitely. Rewrite both hex loops to match and
        remove \x{} support.
        (compile_branch): Restructure loops so that we don't special-case a "]"
        at the beginning of a character class. Remove code that treated "+" as
        the possessive quantifier.
        (jsRegExpCompile): Change the "]" handling here too.

        * pcre/pcre_exec.cpp: (match): Changed CIRC to match the DOLL implementation.
        Changed DOLL to remove handling of "terminating newline", a Perl concept
        which we don't need.

        * tests/mozilla/expected.html: Two tests are fixed now:
        ecma_3/RegExp/regress-100199.js and ecma_3/RegExp/regress-188206.js.
        One test fails now: ecma_3/RegExp/perlstress-002.js -- our success before
        was due to a bug (we treated all 1-character numeric escapes as backreferences).
        The date tests also now both expect success -- whatever was making them fail
        before was probably due to the time being close to a DST shift; maybe we need
        to get rid of those tests.

        Fix <rdar://5578982> ASSERT in HashTable::checkTableConsistencyExceptSize beneath WebNotificationCenter

        The bug was due to a mismatch between HashMap::remove and
        HashTable::checkTableConsistency. HashMap::remove can delete the value
        stored in the HashTable (by derefing it), which is not normally
        allowed by HashTable. It's OK in this case because the value is about
        to be removed from the table, but HashTable wasn't aware of this.

        HashMap::remove now performs the consistency check itself before
        derefing the value.

        Darin noticed that the same bug would occur in HashSet, so I've fixed
        it there as well.

          next round of changes to JSRegExp (formerly PCRE)

        This is a combination of converting to C++, tweaking the API, and adding
        some additional optimizations.

        Future steps will involve getting rid of the use of UTF-8 completely
        (we'll use UTF-16 exclusively instead), eliminating more source files,
        and some more speed-ups.

        SunSpider says the current round is an 0.9% speed-up overall, and a
        5.3% speed-up for regexp.

        * pcre/pcre_exec.cpp: Copied from JavaScriptCore/pcre/pcre_exec.c.
        Added a case that uses computed goto for the opcode loop, but did not turn it on.
        Changed the RMATCH macro to handle returns more efficiently by putting the where
        pointer in the new frame instead of the old one, allowing us to branch to the
        return with a single statement. Switched to new/delete from pcre_malloc/free.
        Changed many RRETURN callers to not set the return value since it's already
        set correctly. Replaced the rrc variable with an is_match variable. Values other
        than "match" and "no match" are now handled differently. This allows us to remove
        the code to check for those cases in various rules.
        (match): All the case statements use a macro BEGIN_OPCODE instead. And all the
        continue statements, or break statements that break out of the outer case use
        a macro NEXT_OPCODE instead. Replaced a few if statements with assertions.
        (jsRegExpExecute): Use new/delete instead of pcre_malloc/free. Removed unused
        start_match field from the match block.

        * pcre/pcre_internal.h: Moved the last few configuration macros from pcre-config.h
        in here. Removed various unused types. Converted from JSRegExpChar to UChar.
        Eliminated pcre_malloc/free. Replaced the opcode enum with a macro that can be
        used in multiple places. Unfortunately we lose the comments for each opcode; we
        should find a place to put those back. Removed ctype_digit.

        * pcre/pcre_maketables.cpp: Copied from JavaScriptCore/pcre/pcre_maketables.c.
        (pcre_maketables): Got rid of the conditional code that allows this to be compiled

          getting characters by indexing into a string is very slow

        This fixes one source of the slowness -- the conversion to an unused
        Identifier as we call the get function from the slot -- but doesn't
        fix others, such as the fact that we have to allocate a new UString::Rep
        for every single character.

        Speeds up string-base64 30%, and at least 0.5% overall.
        But does slow down access-fannkuch quite a bit. Might be worth
        revisiting in the future to see what we can do about that (although
        I did look at a profile for a while).

        takes advantage of setCustomNumeric to avoid creating an Identifier.

        Fix regression caused by earlier bitwise and optimisation.  1 & undefined != 1.

        The implementation of JSImmediate::areBothImmediateNumbers relies on 
        (JSImmediate::getTag(immediate1) & JSImmediate::getTag(immediate2)) having 
        a unique result when both immediate values are numbers.

        The regression was due to UndefinedType & NumberType returning NumberType (3 & 1).

        Add a fast path for bitwise-and of two immediate numbers for a 0.7% improvement in SunSpider (4% bitop improvement).

        This only improves bitwise-and performance, as the additional logic required 
        for similar code paths on or, xor, and shifting requires additional operations
        and branches that negate (and in certain cases, regress) any advantage we might
        otherwise receive.

        This improves performance on all bitop tests, the cryptography tests, as well as 
        the string-base64 and string-unpack-code tests.  No significant degradation on

        Convert JavaScript internal function objects to use one class per
        function.  This avoids a switch statement inside what used to be
        the shared function classes and will allow Shark to better analyze
        the code.

        To make this switch, the value property of the HashEntry was changed
        to a union of an intptr_t (which is used to continue handle valueGetters)
        and function pointer which points to a static constructor for the
        individual new function objects.

        Replace the use of floats for immediate values with the use of integers for a 4.5% improvement in SunSpider.

        Unfortunately this change results in NaN, +Inf, -Inf, and -0 being heap allocated now, but
        we should now have faster array access, faster immediate to double conversion, and the 
        potential to further improve bitwise operators in future.

        This also removes the need for unions to avoid strict aliasing problems when extracting

        Put RegExpImp properties into a static hashtable to avoid a slew of

        Factored important bits of regular expression implementation out of

        making RegExp a ref-counted class. (This will help later.)

        There was a mistake in the algorithm used to find an empty slot in the property
        map entries vector; when we were putting in a new property value and not overwriting
        an existing deleted sentinel, we would enlarge the entries vector, but would not
        overwrite the stale data that's in the new part. It was easy to pin this down by
        turning on property map consistency checks -- I never would have landed with this

          remove unused PCRE features for speed

        A first step toward removing the PCRE features we don't use.
        This gives a 0.8% speedup on SunSpider, and a 6.5% speedup on
        the SunSpider regular expression test.

        Replaced the public interface with one that doesn't use the
        name PCRE. Removed code we don't need for JavaScript and various
        configurations we don't use. This is in preparation for still
        more changes in the future. We'll probably switch to C++ and
        make some even more significant changes to the regexp engine
        to get some additional speed.

        There's probably additional unused stuff that I haven't
        deleted yet.

        This does mean that our PCRE is now a fork, but I think that's
        not really a big deal.

        * JavaScriptCore.exp: Remove the 5 old entry points and add
        the 3 new entry points for WebCore's direct use of the regular
        expression engine.

        * kjs/config.h: Remove the USE(PCRE16) define. I decided to flip
        its sense and now there's a USE(POSIX_REGEX) instead, which should
        probably not be set by anyone. Maybe later we'll just get rid of it
        altogether.

        * kjs/regexp.h:
        * kjs/regexp.cpp:
        (KJS::RegExp::RegExp): Switch to new jsRegExp function names and
        defines. Cut down on the number of functions used.
        (KJS::RegExp::~RegExp): Ditto.
        (KJS::RegExp::match): Ditto.

        * pcre/dftables.c: (main): Get rid of ctype_letter and ctype_meta,
        which are unused.

        * pcre/pcre-config.h: Get rid of EBCIDIC, PCRE_DATA_SCOPE, const,
        size_t, HAVE_STRERROR, HAVE_MEMMOVE, HAVE_BCOPY, NEWLINE,
        POSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD, NO_RECURSE, SUPPORT_UCP, SUPPORT_UTF8,
        and JAVASCRIPT. These are all no longer configurable in our copy
        of the library.

        * pcre/pcre.h: Remove the macro-based kjs prefix hack, the PCRE
        version macros, PCRE_UTF16, the code to set up PCRE_DATA_SCOPE,
        the include of <stdlib.h>, and most of the constants and
        functions defined in this header. Changed the naming scheme to
        use a JSRegExp prefix rather than a pcre prefix. In the future,
        we'll probably change this to be a C++ header.

        * pcre/pcre_compile.c: Removed all unused code branches,
        including many whole functions and various byte codes.
        Kept changes outside of removal to a minimum.

        (jsRegExpFree): Added.

        * pcre/pcre_exec.c: Removed many unused opcodes and variables.
        Also started tearing down the NO_RECURSE mechanism since it's
        now the default. In some cases there were things in the explicit
        frame that could be turned into plain old local variables and
        other small like optimizations.
        (pchars):
        (match_ref):
        (match): Changed parameters quite a bit since it's now not used

        PUBLIC_OPTIONS, PUBLIC_EXEC_OPTIONS, PUBLIC_DFA_EXEC_OPTIONS,

        _pcre_utt, _pcre_utt_size, _pcre_try_flipped, _pcre_ucp_findprop,
        and _pcre_valid_utf8. Also moved pcre_malloc and pcre_free here.

        * pcre/pcre_maketables.c: Changed to only compile in dftables.
        Also got rid of many of the tables that we don't use.

        * wtf/FastMallocPCRE.cpp: Removed unused bits. It would be good
        to eliminate this completely, but we need the regular expression
        code to be C++ first.

        The property map now has an array of indices and a separate array of
        property map entries. This slightly slows down lookup because of a second
        memory acess, but makes property maps smaller and faster to iterate in
        functions like mark().

        SunSpider says this is 1.2% faster, although it makes the bitwise-end test
        more than 10% slower. To fix that we'll need to optimize global variable lookup.

        AST transfom to replace slow resolve nodes with fast local variable
        alternatives that do direct memory access. Currently, only ResolveNode
        provides a fast local variable alternative. 6 others are soon to come.
        
        16.7% speedup on SunSpider.
        
        Most of this patch is just scaffolding to support iterating all the 
        resolve nodes in the AST through optimizeResolveNodes(). In 
        optimizeResolveNodes(), most classes just push their child nodes onto 
        the processing stack, while ResolveNodes actually replace themselves in 
        the tree with more optimized alternatives, if possible.

        Here are the interesting bits:

        * kjs/nodes.h: Added PlacementNewAdoptTag, along with implementations 
        in Node and ResolveNode. This tag allows you to use placement new to 
        swap out a base class Node in favor of a subclass copy that holds the
        same data. (Without this tag, default initialization would NULL out
        RefPtrs, change line numbers, etc.)

        * kjs/nodes.cpp:
        (KJS::ResolveNode::evaluate): Since we're taking the slow path, ASSERT
        that the fast path is impossible, to make sure we didn't leave anything

          remove GroupNode to simplify AST and possibly get a modest speedup

        This patch removes 4 node types: GroupNode, PropertyNameNode,
        FunctionCallParenBracketNode, and FunctionCallParenDotNode.

        To remove GroupNode, we add knowledge of precedence to the tree nodes,
        and use that when serializing to determine where parentheses are needed.
        This means we no longer have to represent parentheses in the tree.

        The precedence values are named after productions in the grammar from the
        JavaScript standard.

        SunSpider says this is an 0.4% speedup.

        * kjs/function.h:
        * kjs/function.cpp: Removed escapeStringForPrettyPrinting -- it's part of
        serialization, so I moved it to the file that takes care of that.

        * kjs/grammar.y: Changed makeGetterOrSetterPropertyNode to use 0 to
        indicate failure instead of a separate boolean. Got rid of PropertyNameNode
        by merging the PropertyName rule into the Property rule (which was easier
        than figuring out how to pass the Identifier from one node to another).
        Got rid of GroupNode, nodeInsideAllParens(), FunctionCallParenBracketNode,
        and FunctionCallParenDotNode.

        * kjs/nodes.h: Removed unused forward declarations and Operator values.
        Added Precedence enum, and precedence function to all nodes. Removed
        nodeInsideAllParens. Added streamBinaryOperator function for serialization.
        Removed GroupNode and PropertyNameNode. Made PropertyNode store an Identifier.
        Removed FunctionCallParenBracketNode and FunctionCallParenDotNode.

        * kjs/nodes.cpp: Removed Node::nodinsideAllParens, GroupNode, and PropertyNameNode.
        (KJS::PropertyListNode::evaluate): Changed code to get name directly instead
        of converting it from an Identifier to a jsString then back to a UString
        then into an Identifier again!

        * kjs/nodes2string.cpp: Changed special-token implementation to use a separate
        function for each of Endl, Indent, Unindent, and DotExpr instead of using a
        single function with a switch. Added a precedence that you can stream in, to
        cause the next node serialized to add parentheses based on that precedence value.
        (KJS::operatorString): Moved to the top of the file.
        (KJS::escapeStringForPrettyPrinting): Moved here from function.cpp. Removed old
        workaround for snprintf, since StringExtras.h takes care of that.

        character append functions instead of constructing a UString. Added the logic

        - numerous HashTable performance improvements
        
        This does not quite add up to a measurable win on SunSpider, but it allows a
        follow-on > 3% improvement and probably helps WebCore too.
        
        I made the following improvements, among others:
        
        - Made HashFunctions note whether it is ok to compare a real value with the equal() function
        to the empty or deleted value, and used this to optimize the comparisons done in hash lookup.
        
        - Specialized lookup so it doesn't have to do so many extra branches and build so many extra
        std::pairs for cases that don't need them. There are now four versions, one for read-only access,
        two for writing, and one folded directly into add() (these all were improvments).
        
        - Made HashMap::get() use lookup() directly instead of find() to avoid having to build iterators.
        
        - Made a special constructor for iterators that knows it points to
        a valid filled cell and so skips updating itself.

        - Reordered memory accesses in the various lookup functions for better code generation
        
        - Made simple translators avoid passing a hash code around
        
        - Other minor tweaks

        Shrink the size of an activation object by 1 word
        
        This is in preparation for adding a symbol table to the activation 
        object.
        
        The basic strategy here is to rely on the mutual exclusion between
        the arguments object pointer and the function pointer (you only need
        the latter in order to create the former), and store them in the same 
        place. The LazyArgumentsObject class encapsulates this strategy.

        Change JavaScriptCore.vcproj to use DerivedSources.make

        We were trying to emulate the logic of make in
        build-generated-files.sh, but we got it wrong. We now use a
        build-generated-files very much like the one that WebCore uses to
        invoke make.

        We also now only have a Debug configuration of dftables which we build
        even when doing a Release build of JavaScriptCore. dftables also no
        longer has the "_debug" name suffix.

        Changes mostly made by Darin, reviewed by me.

        * DerivedSources.make: Add a variable to set the extension used for
        the dftables executable.
        * JavaScriptCore.vcproj/JavaScriptCore.sln: Updated to use Debug
        dftables in Release configurations.

           - Modified pre-build event to pass the right arguments to
             build-generated-files.sh and not call dftables directly.
           - Added the derived source files to the project.
           - Removed grammarWrapper.cpp, which isn't needed now that we're
             compiling grammar.cpp directly.

        This means that you only have to gather the declaration nodes the first 
        time the function executes. Performance gain of 2.10% on SunSpider, 
        0.90% on command-line JS iBench.

        To improve encapsulation, moved processDeclarations call into
        FunctionBodyNode::execute. Also marked processDeclarations

        Re-structured variable and function declaration code.
        
        Command-line JS iBench shows no regression.
        
        Here are the changes:

        1. Function declarations are now processed at the same time as var 
        declarations -- namely, immediately upon entry to an execution context. 
        This does not match Firefox, which waits to process a function
        declaration until the declaration's containing block executes, but it 
        does match IE and the ECMA spec. (10.1.3 states that var and function 
        declarations should be processed at the same time -- namely, "On 
        entering an execution context." 12.2 states that "A Block does not 
        define a new execution scope.")

        2. Declaration processing proceeds iteratively now, rather than 
        recursively, storing the nodes is finds in stacks. This will later 
        facilitate an optimization to hold on to the gathered declaration nodes, 
        rather than re-fetching them in every function call.

        Removed surprising self-named "hack" that made nested functions 
        available as named properties of their containing functions, and placed
        containing function objects in the scope chains of nested functions.
        
        There were a few reasons to remove this "hack:"

        1. It contradicted FF, IE, and the ECMA spec.

        2. It incurred a performance penalty, since merely parsing a function 
        required parsing its body for nested functions (and so on).

        3. SVN history contains no explanation for why it was added. It was just
        legacy code in a large merge a long, long time ago.

        Iteration statements sometimes incorrectly evaluate to the empty value 
        (KDE r670547). 
        
        [ Broken off from http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14868 ]
        
        This patch is a merge of KDE r670547, with substantial modification 
        for performance.
        
        It fixes do-while statements to evaluate to a value. (They used
        to evaluate to the empty value in all cases.) 

        It also fixes SourceElementsNode to maintain the value of abnormal 
        completions like "break" and "continue."
        
        It also re-works the main execution loop in SourceElementsNode so that
        it (1) makes a little more sense and (2) avoids unnecessary work. This 
        is a .28% speedup on command-line JS iBench.
