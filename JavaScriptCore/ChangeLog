        Switched ActivationImp to using a symbol table. For now, though, all
        clients take the slow path.
        
        Net .6% speedup on SunSpider.
        
        Slowdowns:
            - ActivationImp now mallocs in its constructor
            - Local variable hits use an extra level of indirection to retrieve 
            data
            - Local variable misses do two lookups

        Shrink the size of an activation object by 1 word
        
        This is in preparation for adding a symbol table to the activation

        The basic strategy here is to rely on the mutual exclusion between
        the arguments object pointer and the function pointer (you only need

        Change JavaScriptCore.vcproj to use DerivedSources.make

        We were trying to emulate the logic of make in
        build-generated-files.sh, but we got it wrong. We now use a
        build-generated-files very much like the one that WebCore uses to
        invoke make.

        We also now only have a Debug configuration of dftables which we build
        even when doing a Release build of JavaScriptCore. dftables also no
        longer has the "_debug" name suffix.

          js1_5/Array/array-001.js test failing

        One of the JavaScriptCore tests was failing; it failed because of
        my change to NumberImp::getUInt32. The incorrect code I copied was
        from JSImmediate::getUInt32, and was a pre-existing bug.

        This patch fixes correctness, but will surely slow down SunSpider.
        We may be able to code this tighter and get the speed back.

        Re-structured variable and function declaration code.
        
        Command-line JS iBench shows no regression.
        
        Here are the changes:

        1. Function declarations are now processed at the same time as var 
        declarations -- namely, immediately upon entry to an execution context. 
        This does not match Firefox, which waits to process a function
        declaration until the declaration's containing block executes, but it 
        does match IE and the ECMA spec. (10.1.3 states that var and function 
        declarations should be processed at the same time -- namely, "On 
        entering an execution context." 12.2 states that "A Block does not 
        define a new execution scope.")

        2. Declaration processing proceeds iteratively now, rather than 
        recursively, storing the nodes is finds in stacks. This will later 
        facilitate an optimization to hold on to the gathered declaration nodes, 
        rather than re-fetching them in every function call.

        Removed surprising self-named "hack" that made nested functions 
        available as named properties of their containing functions, and placed
        containing function objects in the scope chains of nested functions.
        
        There were a few reasons to remove this "hack:"

        1. It contradicted FF, IE, and the ECMA spec.

        2. It incurred a performance penalty, since merely parsing a function 
        required parsing its body for nested functions (and so on).

        3. SVN history contains no explanation for why it was added. It was just
        legacy code in a large merge a long, long time ago.

        fastFree() in the destructor for the inlineCapacity != 0 template

        It also fixes SourceElementsNode to maintain the value of abnormal

        It also re-works the main execution loop in SourceElementsNode so that
