	Pass -seg_addr_table_filename <FILENAME> to ld.  This makes our frameworks in
	SYMROOT actually work for symbol resolution because they will have the correct
	prebinding address.  It also fixes obscure B&I problems with prebinding
	reported by Matt Reda.

	Note the reason all this is tricky for our projects is that we have a different
	install location for Jaguar and Panther.  The purpose of this arg is to declare
	at link time our eventual location, which allows the prebinding address to be
	found in /AppleInternal/Developer/seg_addr_table.  We use a funky back-tick
	expression within OTHER_LDFLAGS to get a conditional value depending on the
	build train we are in.

	This can all go away once we only build on Panther and don't embed the
	frameworks inside the Safari.app wrapper.

 	In addition I fixed the OTHER_LDFLAGS settings in our build styles to be
	additive instead of overriding, so we have the args we used for B&I in force
	when building outside of B&I.
