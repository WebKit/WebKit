        - speedups, total 12% on JavaScript iBench

        I ran the benchmark under Shark and followed its advice a lot, mainly.

        * kjs/collector.cpp:
        (KJS::Collector::allocate): Take out special case for 0; costing speed but unexercised.
        Use numLiveObjectsAtLastCollect instead of numAllocationsSinceLastCollect so we don't
        have to bump it each time we call allocate. Put numLiveObjects into a local variable to
        cut down on global variable accesses. Make "next" cell pointer be a byte offset rather
        than a pointer so we don't need a special case for NULL. Allow freeList to point to some
        bogus item when the entire block is full rather than going out of our way to make it
        point to NULL.
        (KJS::Collector::markProtectedObjects): Get table size and pointer into locals outside
        the loop to avoid re-loading them over and over again.
        (KJS::Collector::collect): Put numLiveObjects into a local variable to cut down on global
        variable accesses. Make "next" cell pointer be a byte offset as above. Put numLiveObjects
        into a local variable to cut down on global variable accesses. Set numLiveObjectsAtLastCollect
        rather than numAllocationsSinceLastCollect.
        (KJS::Collector::numReferencedObjects): Get table size and pointer into locals outside
        the loop to avoid re-loading them over and over again.
        (KJS::Collector::rootObjectClasses): Ditto.

        * kjs/internal.h: Make Value be a friend of NumberImp so it can construct number objects
        directly, avoiding the conversion from Number to Value.

        * kjs/internal.cpp: (StringImp::toObject): Don't use Object::dynamicCast, because we know
        the thing is an object and we don't want to do all the extra work; just cast directly.

        * kjs/list.cpp: (KJS::List::List): Construct valueRefCount in a way that avoids the need for
        a branch -- in the hot case this just meant avoiding checking a variable we just set to false.

        * kjs/lookup.cpp: (keysMatch): Marked this inline.

        * kjs/nodes.cpp: Disabled KJS_BREAKPOINT, to avoid calling hitStatement all the time.
        (BooleanNode::evaluate): Make a Value directly, rather than making a Boolean which is converted
        into a Value.
        (NumberNode::evaluate): Ditto.
        (StringNode::evaluate): Ditto.
        (ArrayNode::evaluate): Ditto.
        (FunctionCallNode::evaluate): Use new inline baseIfMutable to avoid unnecessary getBase function.
        Also just use a pointer for func, rather than an Object.
        (PostfixNode::evaluate): Change code so that it doesn't make an excess Number, and so that it
        passes a "known to be integer" boolean in, often avoiding a conversion from floating point to
        integer and back.
        (DeleteNode::evaluate): Make a Value directly.
        (TypeOfNode::evaluate): Use new inline baseIfMutable and make Value directly.

        passes a "known to be integer" boolean in, often avoiding a conversion from floating point to
        integer and back.
        (UnaryPlusNode::evaluate): Make a Value directly.

        passes a "known to be integer" boolean in, often avoiding a conversion from floating point to

        (KJS::relation): Rearranged code so that we don't need explicit isNaN checks.
        (KJS::add): Changed code to make Value directly, and so that it passes a "known to be integer"
        boolean in, often avoiding a conversion from floating point to integer and back.
        (KJS::mult): Ditto.

        * kjs/property_map.cpp:
        (KJS::PropertyMap::~PropertyMap): Get size and entries pointer outside loop to avoid
        re-getting them inside the loop.
        (KJS::PropertyMap::clear): Ditto. Clear value pointer in addition to key, so we can just

	Fix for <rdar://problem/4025212> "REGRESSION (163-164): search not performed correctly; united.com"
	JavaScript unescape("") was returning a messed-up String object that appeared identical to an empty string, but would in some cases act as 'null' when passed to native functions, in this case the Option() constructor.
	In the implementation of unescape, the UString holding the result was not initialized to "", so it started out as a null string. If nothing was appended to it, it remained null, resulting in a JavaScript String object with some bad behaviors (namely, converting it to a DOMStringImpl results in a NULL pointer.)
	Darin says this regression occurred when we replaced our own implementation of unescape() with code from KJS.

        - fixed <rdar://problem/3865365> since -[WebScriptObject dealloc] does not call [super dealloc], the build will fail due to a warning
        - fixed behavior so that [[WebScriptObject alloc] initWithCoder:] doesn't leak WebUndefined instances
          and incidentally so that [[WebScriptObject alloc] init] returns the single shared instance rather
          than allocating a new one

        * bindings/objc/WebScriptObject.mm: Removed some stray semicolons.
        (+[WebUndefined allocWithZone:]): Made this the common bottleneck that returns the single instance
        of WebUndefined, since it's the single method that normally allocates new instances. Calls super to
        actually allocate only the very first time it's called.
        (-[WebUndefined initWithCoder:]): Simplified to just return self (no reason to re-lookup the single
        shared instance since there can be only one).
        (-[WebUndefined copyWithZone:]): Ditto.
        (-[WebUndefined retain]): Ditto.
        (-[WebUndefined retainCount]): Use UINT_MAX constant here (matches usage in NSObject.m for retain count
        of class).
        (-[WebUndefined autorelease]): Simplified to just return self (see above).
        (-[WebUndefined copy]): No need to override this since it just turns around and calls copyWithZone:.
        (-[WebUndefined dealloc]): Added an assertion since this method should never be called. Also added
        a call to [super dealloc] after return; to make the new -Wdealloc-check compiler happy (fixing the
        bug mentioned above).
        (+[WebUndefined undefined]): Reimplemented; calls allocWithZone:NULL to get to the shared instance.
        No need to call init, since that's a no-op for this class.

        1.  Add class parameter to object allocation function.  This is somewhat redundant, given that
        the allocation function is in the class function vector, but people wanted to use the same
        allocation function for different classes.
        
        2.  Renamed NPN_Class to NPN_Invoke to match the name in the function vector.
        
        3.  Add support for a default function on an object.  This is a feature that ActiveX supports,
        and will allow JavaScript code to be written that will look exactly the same for both ActiveX
        plugins and Netscape or WebKit plugins.  There are implementations included for the 'C' and
        'Objective-C' bindings.

        - switch PCRE to do UTF-16 directly instead of converting to/from UTF-8 for speed

        * pcre/pcre.h: Added PCRE_UTF16 switch, set to 1. Added pcre_char typedef, which is char
        or uint16_t depending on the mode, and used appropriate in the 7 public functions
        that need to use it.
        * pcre/pcre.c: Add UTF-16 support to all functions.
        * pcre/study.c: Ditto.

        * pcre/internal.h: Added ichar typedef, which is unsigned char or uint16_t depending on

        Optimize prepend using the shared substring optimization. Also,
        limit the applicability of shared append and shared prepend. If
        you overdo it, it does more harm than good, because you create a
        bunch of strings that are disqualified from future shared
        append/prepend, for not much immediate savings in allocate/copy

        - fixed <rdar://problem/3600691>: Table generation test is really slow
        - fixed <rdar://problem/3600661>: 24fun date test is really slow

        80% speedup on the string test, lesser speedups on the other two.
        
        Two different optimizations here:

        1) Avoid large overhead of scanning strings to see if they are all
        ASCII before numeric conversion.
        
        * kjs/nodes.cpp:
        (AssignNode::evaluate): Don't convert to integer until we know for
        sure the operation will need it. Attempting to convert strings to
        numbers is a waste when they are being appended with +=.

        2) Avoid huge cost of appending strings.

        This is done by allowing multiple strings to share a buffer but
        actually use different ranges of it. The first time a string is
        appended to, we start leaving at least 10% extra space in the
        buffer, so doing N appends to the same string takes O(log N)
        mallocs instead of O(N).

        Stitched together the NP stuff to our language independent
        JavaScript binding stuff.  Very close to being done.
        
        Added program to test C bindings (and NP stuff).  Just tests
        properties.  Will add methods and JavaScript access, etc.

        Updated Makefile.am to account for new bindings/c directory.

        Change NP_UTF8 from "const char *" to "char" to allow for
        declarations like "const NP_UTF8 *" and "NP_UTF8 *".  Ditto
        for NP_UTF16.

        Added NP_IsValidIdentifier().

        To work-around the problem I explicitly delete all local refs.
        Further, I've added Push/PopLocalFrame calls to catch any refs
        that I may have missed.  This will guarantee that we don't leak
        any Java references.

The assert in this case is firing because we've received a finalize call from Java for an instance that we no longer know about.

        The run loop that is used to execute JavaScript (in practice, always the main run loop) is held in a class variable.  It is set and retained once and should not be released.  Unfortunately is it being released when the 'root' object on a LiveConnect applet is released.  This has the symptom of eventually causing an deallocation of the main run loop!  Usually after about 5 instantiations/destructions of a LiveConnect applet.  The CFRelease of the run loop was removed.

        Added support for calling a JavaScript function from

        functions, but the conversion of args and return values
        will come shortly.

        Cleaned up and verified reference counting scheme, and
        dereferencing of vended JavaScript objects when applet is
        destroyed (actually when part is destroyed).
        
        Removed link hack for testkjs now that the Java folks think
        they have a solution for the 1.4.2 JavaVM link problem.  Although
        Greg B. thinks his solution may cause problems for the 1.3.1
        version of the VM!?!

        when an instance of JSObject is instantiated and messaged.
        When these are implemented the Java will be able to originate
        calls into JavaScript.

        Also a temporary work-around added to Makefile.am to solve

        <rdar://problem/3497643>: reproducible crash printing self-referential array

2003-12-01  Richard Williamson   <rjw@apple.com>

Fixed parameter passing to applet.  Child elements are NOT valid in setStyle().  So we now create the widget before needed with createWidgetIfNecessary.  This either happens when doing the first layout, or when JavaScript first references the applet element.

Fixed early delete of the the main applet instance.  When the JS collector cleaned up the last JS object referring to the applet instance we were deleting the java instance.  This caused the applet instance cached on the applet element to be invalid.  The applet instance is the only Java object not to be cleaned up by the JS collector.

Added support for getting at Java object fields.
