<h2><span id="logo">&#x2600;</span>SunSpider 1.0.1 JavaScript Benchmark</h2>

<p>This is SunSpider, a JavaScript benchmark. This benchmark tests the
core JavaScript language only, not the DOM or other browser APIs. It
is designed to compare different versions of the same browser, and
different browsers to each other.</p>

<p>This version of the harness is 1.0.1. This page lists all versions
of the test content:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="sunspider-0.9/driver.html">Version 0.9</a></li>
