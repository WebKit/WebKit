# This is a useful hack for cleaning up the payloads generated by Air::dumpAsJS(). That will
# generate code that computes the hash of insts and stack slots and checks it. This is useful for
# debugging, but we probably don't want that overhead in the payloads we deploy. So, you can run
# this script to remove all of the hashing code.

ARGV.each {
    | filename |
    IO::write(filename, IO::read(filename).lines.reject{|v| v =~ /hash/i}.join())
