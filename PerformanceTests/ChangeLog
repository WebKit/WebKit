        Improve the performance of FontCascadeDescription's effectiveFamilies
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184720

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This performance test calls SystemFontDatabase::systemFontCascadeList() around 2,000,000 times (before
        this patch is applied), which is roughly equivalent to the page we found the performance problem on.
        The calling pattern is roughly equivalent in this test.

        The test should be doing multiple rounds of mutations in a single document to test what is supposed to test (like it did before r227756).
