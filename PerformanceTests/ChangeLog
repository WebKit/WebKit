        Add sub-tests based on Suits
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186260

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        Add a new developer Suits suite with sub-tests that isolate parts of each particle.
        The sub-tests are:
            - Particles using only clip paths
            - Particles using only shapes
            - Particles that have no gradients
            - Particles that have no rotation
            - Particles that do not move around at all (but all of the physics calculations are
            still performed)

        * MotionMark/resources/debug-runner/tests.js:
        * MotionMark/tests/master/resources/svg-particles.js: Rename the stage, particle, and
        benchmark to "Suits" from "SVG". Change SuitsParticle so that we guarantee 50% clip and
        shape paths rather than relying on random chance. Wrap a check around creation of the
        gradient element, and use a simple fill color when we aren't using a gradient.
        * MotionMark/tests/svg/suits.html: Added.
        * MotionMark/tests/svg/suits.js: Added.
        Look for the query string and set the particle based on what is selected.

        Allow the ramp controller to run tests that take less time than the initial ramp-up phase
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186257

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        * MotionMark/tests/resources/main.js: Extend the desired end timestamp when ramp-up occurs.
        Previously the controller assumed that the duration of the test was always longer than the
        time it took to figure out the order of magnitude of particles to render. When that range
        is determined, the end timestamp is then extended. If the duration is too short, the controller
        would throw an exception. The fix is to continue extending the timestamp every time the order of
        magnitude tiers up.

        In general testing with really short durations isn't practical, but sometimes it is
        desired for debugging.

        To avoid confusion of the private variables, I renamed Benchmark._startTimestamp to
        Benchmark._benchmarkStartTimestamp, to disambiguate from Controller._startTimestamp.
        Benchmark._startTimestamp is set once and never changed, after the initial 100ms warm-up.
        Controller._startTimestamp is initialized to 0 (which means "not initialized"), and then after
        the warm up is complete, set in Controller.start() to the same wall clock timestamp, and never
        changed afterwards.
