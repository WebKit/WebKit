        [MotionMark] Temporarily remove the focus test
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225714

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The focus test is causing unacceptably high variance on test results. Initial investigation
        indicates that this is related to secondary and tertiary interactions between the browser's
        runloop and the compositor's runloop. Not only that, but the variable cost of the focus test
        seems to affect the variance on the subtests which run after it.

        This patch temporarily removes the focus test, just so we can get a stronger signal of
        browsers' true performance, while we do a deeper analysis of the focus test.

        Because the focus test's score is lower than the average score of the subtests, removing it
        causes scores in all browsers to increase:

                             | WebKit | Chrome | Firefox

        Reviewed by Jon Lee.

        Currently, "ramp" tests have three phases. The middle phase is where they try to determine a maximum reasonable
        complexity, and the third one is where they try various complexities between 0 and the maximum. The calculation
        of this maximum reasonable complexity is currently very sensitive to outlier frame times. If there is a single
        outlier frame time, the failure mode is to assume that the maximum complexity is ~10. So, the solution is to
        ignore outlier frame times during this first phase, and to ensure that there are at least 9 frames measured that
        have non-outlier times.

        This test also changes the speed of the middle phase. Previously, each interval during this phase had
        a complexity that was 3.16x of the previous complexity. This patch changes that to 1.78x of the previous
        complexity for complexities above 50, and 1.33x for complexities above 10,000.

        The focus test loads up the window server with work, which runs asynchronously from WebKit's run loop.
        This means that the window server can still be busy when the next test starts.

        In r270959 we already tried to combat this, and it was mostly successful, but not as successful as we'd
        like. This patch goes further by:
        1. Bumping up the warmup timeout to 2000ms from 1000ms
        2. Making the warmup render at least 30 frames. This means that a single extremely long frame can't
           fill up the entire warmup period.

        Eliminate 'async time' in StyleBench
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219785

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        r270132 (a RunLoop change) measured as a 13% regression on the
        StyleBench bot. But I don't think the measured regression was user-real.
        Instead, I think the baseline score was artificially high because 'async
        time' sometimes did not measure painting.

        I decided just to eliminate 'async time' (and force style resolution +
        layout during 'sync time') because this benchmark intends to measure
        style resolution + layout, and not painting or frame rate.

        With this change, there is no measured regression anymore.

        Explanation of 'did not measure painting':

                StyleBench synchronously modifies DOM + style, and then sets a
                zero-delay timer to measure 'async time'. If layout has not
                happened by the time the timer fires, StyleBench forces layout
                and then computes 'async time'. The flaw here is painting.
                StyleBench accepts both of these orders of operations as valid:
                
                (A) { modify DOM + style }, { measure 'sync time' }, { style resolution + layout }, { paint }, { measure 'async time' }

                (B) { modify DOM + style }, { measure 'sync time' }, { style resolution + layout }, { measure 'async time' }, { paint }

                ^ (B) includes more stuff than (A). Not cool!

        Evidence for the theory that the baseline was sometimes doing (B):

                * Forcing style resolution + layout during sync time reduces the
                baseline score and eliminates the difference in async time
                between baseline and patch.

                * Starting the benchmark from a requestAnimationFrame() instead
                of a timer reduces the baseline score and eliminates the
                difference in async time between baseline and patch.

                * The regression only reproduced on machines with fewer cores.

                * The new benchmark method reduces sttdev by ~3X - ~5X.

        * StyleBench/resources/benchmark-runner.js:
        (BenchmarkRunner.prototype._runTest): Call getBoundingClientRect()
        during sync time to force style resolution + layout consistently.

        Always report async time as 1, since this benchmark doesn't have an
        async time component anymore. (The harness doesn't like zeroes.)

        Just store height in a global because that is sufficient to prevent
        dead code elimination (which was probably impossible anyway, since
        getBoundingClientRect() has side effects).

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Bug 42796 introduced MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_<PLATFORM> as "support
        for compiling WebKit against iOS SDKs". Support for the iOS part of
        this feature was later removed in several changes, including Bug
        139212, Bug 139463 and Bug 144762. However, vestiges have remained for
        five or six years in the form of MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_macosx. The
        inclusion of the platform in MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is no longer
        needed and can be removed.

        This changes brings most projects in conformance with other projects
        that don't support including the platform in MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET,
        including WebEditingTester, gtest, WebKitTestRunner, MiniBrowser, and
        TestWebKitAPI.

        Along the way, remove a couple of left-over references to macOS 10.16,
        and a couple of places where [sdk=macosx*] was still being used.

        With this change, initialization of MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET should be
        consistent across all projects, with two exceptions: WebKitLauncher
        (which hardcodes it to 10.12) and libwebrtc's copy of googletest
        (which hardcodes it to 10.4). The reasons for these hard-coded values
        is not apparent, so leave them be.

        The previous workaround turns out to be ineffective because we can't set the value of 
        TARGET_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR based on a previous value of itself. Introduce a new 
        variable TARGET_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR to determine whether we need to explicitly 
        adjust MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR to 110000.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Due to a bug in Xcode (rdar://70185899), Xcode 12.0 and Xcode 12.1 Beta incorrectly includes the 
        minor release number in MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR, which causes Debug and Release builds of WebKit 
        to be misconfigured when building on macOS Big Sur SUs, leading to webpages failing to load.

        To work around the Xcode bug, when the MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR includes the minor version number, 
        drop the minor version number by explicitly setting TARGET_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAJOR to 110000.

        Note: This change should be reverted after <rdar://70185899> is resolved.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        APIBench is a new benchmark suite to measure the performance of the JavaScriptCore API. It has 4 benchmarks:
        - RichardsJS: This is imported from Octane and used as a reference so we know how fast the pure JS implementation runs.
        - RichardsSwift: a Swift port of the benchmark, also used as reference for how fast the pure Swift implementation is.
        - RichardsMostlyJS: As the name suggests, mostly the same the as the JS benchmark, but here the WorkerTask
          is implemented in Swift. The API is used to write to the packet being processed and talking to the scheduler.
        - RichardsMostlySwift: inverse of the above. Mostly the same code from the Swift benchark, but here the WorkerTask is
          implemented in JavaScript. The API is used to run the JS version of the task and marshaling the Packet by using JSExport.

        The benchmark can be built and run using the api-bench script, as following:

        PerformanceTests/APIBench/api-bench WebKitBuild/Release

        By default, it will build each of the benchmarks and run 5 iterations.
        The score is calculated as 5000 / geomean([avg of RichardsMostlySwift, avg of RichardsMostlyJS]).
        The script prints the average for the references and tests and the final score:

        Results for /Volumes/Data/wk2/OpenSource/WebKitBuild/Release (5 iterations)

        RAMification should have a way of gathering vmmaps for each test at the end of each run
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210060

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        When I was debugging a memory issue, I needed to gather vmmaps for each
        RAMification subtest. This patch is checking in the code I wrote to be able
        to do this. It works by:
        - Passing in an argument to RAMification saying we want vmmaps at the end of
        each subtest run.
        - RAMification invokes jsc with an environment variable that tells the shell
        to wait for one character of input from stdin before exiting.
        - The jsc shell also disables the bmalloc scavenger while waiting for input so the
        vmmap we take from the python runner script represents the "footprint" score
        of the benchmark. If the scavenger ran, it would end up releasing too much
        memory for the vmmap to be useful.
        - The python script runs a vmmap, and then communicates to the jsc process
        when the vmmap finishes running.

        Make JSC memory benchmark available on OpenSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195012

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch upstreams the RAMification memory benchmark to open source.

        The prior RAMification.py driver script in the Internal directory has been moved here
        with the device execution code seperated out to a new Internal driver script.
        As a result, command line argument parsing as well as acting on the resulting argument
        values has changed.  The remote device Runner creates an ArgumentParser object that is
        passed through main().  In main(), if we have an ArgumentParser, we use it otherwise we
        create one for benchmarking locally.  The arguments object returned from argument
        parsing is now passed to the Runner constructor so it can extract the settings appropriate
        for that particular runner.

        Added some sane argument default values for the JSC command patch and the JetStream2
        source directory.

        Updated the Lua tests to eliminate the testing harness and its overhead, matching what was
        done in the Internal tree.

        The idea of BigIntBench is to provide a set of microbenchmarks and
        benchmarks to evaluate how fast BigInt computations are happening on
        JSC implementation.

        Now, we are adding microbenchmarks in this set,
        but the plan is to move these tests to "JSTest/microbenchmarks" when
        BigInt is enabled by default. After that, the focus of Bigint bench is
        to provide a set of tests that represents real use cases of BigInt in
        JS programs.

        Make JetStream 2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=187829

        Rubber-stamped by Mark Lam.

        This patch checks in the new JetStream 2 benchmark. JetStream 2 is
        a new JavaScript and Web Assembly benchmark. JetStream 2's goal
        is to measure the startup, worst case, and peak throughput performance
        of the JavaScript engine. JetStream 2 incorporates these previous
        benchmarks:
        - JetStream
        - ARES-6
        - Kraken
        - Web Tooling Benchmark
        - WasmBench
        - RexBench

        JetStream 2 also adds some new benchmarks:
        - Two tests emphasizing web worker performance.
        - One test emphasizing Promise, async iteration, and DataView performance.
        - Two new code load tests.
        - WSL: a test measuring all kinds of things, especially emphasizing exception performance.

        [MotionMark] Add support for version numbers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186479

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        Add support for displaying the version number as well as including it in the JSON results.

        When loading the front page, script replaces any element with classname version with the
        version number of the benchmark, which is stored in Strings.version.

        The JSON structure for the results includes a new version property:
            {
              "version": "1.0",
              "options": { ... },
              "data": [ ... ]
            }

        When dragging a results file, the version listed will come from the JSON file. Older
        results will not have had the version property, in which case it will default to "1.0".

        * MotionMark/index.html: Update title to some other default. Script will update it.
        Include the version number in the logo title.
        * MotionMark/developer.html: Ditto.

        * MotionMark/resources/runner/motionmark.js:
        (ResultsDashboard): Update constructor to include version. This is used when serializing
        results out to JSON, and displaying the results panel in developer mode.
        (ResultsDashboard._processData): When running the benchmark, include benchmark version string
        in the results object.
        (ResultsDashboard.version):
        (window.benchmarkRunnerClient.willStartFirstIteration): When running the benchmark, pass the
        benchmark version string to the dashboard, which holds the results.
        (window.sectionsManager.setSectionVersion): Helper function to update the element in the
        section with the class name version.
        (window.benchmarkController.initialize): Populate all DOM elements with class name "version"

        (window.benchmarkController.showResults): When showing results, update the version string

        Allow the ramp controller to run tests that take less time than the initial ramp-up phase
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186257

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        * MotionMark/tests/resources/main.js: Extend the desired end timestamp when ramp-up occurs.
        Previously the controller assumed that the duration of the test was always longer than the
        time it took to figure out the order of magnitude of particles to render. When that range
        is determined, the end timestamp is then extended. If the duration is too short, the controller
        would throw an exception. The fix is to continue extending the timestamp every time the order of
        magnitude tiers up.

        In general testing with really short durations isn't practical, but sometimes it is
        desired for debugging.

        To avoid confusion of the private variables, I renamed Benchmark._startTimestamp to
        Benchmark._benchmarkStartTimestamp, to disambiguate from Controller._startTimestamp.
        Benchmark._startTimestamp is set once and never changed, after the initial 100ms warm-up.
        Controller._startTimestamp is initialized to 0 (which means "not initialized"), and then after
        the warm up is complete, set in Controller.start() to the same wall clock timestamp, and never
        changed afterwards.
