## Test locally

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` runs the app in development mode
3. Open <http://localhost:3000/> to view it in the browser.

The page reloads whenever you make edits. Lint errors are printed to the console.

## Build

1. `npm run build`

This builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
