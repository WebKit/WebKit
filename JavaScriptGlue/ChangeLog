        Fixed <rdar://problem/4942528> Installer.app Stuck "Examining additional

        The problem was that JavaScriptGlue held a JSObject in a static pointer
        without protecting it from garbage collection. 
        
            sUserObjectPrototypeImp  = new UserObjectPrototypeImp();
            static ProtectedPtr<UserObjectPrototypeImp> protectPrototype; // valiant, brave, but useless

        Through an interesting comedy of errors, this object would be collected 
        and then assigned as the prototype of another object allocated at the 
        same address, thus becoming its own prototype. (See http://www.ziplo.com/grandpa.htm
        for further explanation of this phenomenon.) Hence the infinte loop in 
        property lookup.
        
        The solution is equally humorous: all of this code was completely useless --
        it only served to create an empty object in the prototype chain -- so
        I just removed it.

        - fix <rdar://problem/5000216> JavaScriptGlue framework started turning all CFNumbers
          into signed 32bit values

        Circumstantial evidence seems to indicate that JavaScriptGlue was depending on a bug
        in CFNumber where CFNumberIsFloatType was returning true for 64-bit integer values.

        * JSUtils.cpp: (JSObjectKJSValue): Removed the call to CFNumberIsFloatType in the
        conversion of numeric values, and always use kCFNumberDoubleType, since double is
        the internal format of numbers in JavaScriptCore. There's no value to having a
        separate code path for integers. There's also no reason to check the return value
        from CFNumberGetValue -- if it returns false it still does the best it can to convert
        to a double, which is what we want.

        * UserObjectImp.cpp: (UserObjectImp::toString): Removed a similar code path that
        tried to handle integers separate from double. Instead, always use a double. For
        compatibility, use a format without a decimal point when CFNumberIsFloatType returns
        false. Also removed a bogus cast to float; the "%f" format string takes a double,
        not a float, so all the cast did was cut down on precision.

        - Fixed <rdar://problem/4430836> JavaScript patch crashing Quartz
        Composer

        JSValueWrappers used to hold on to the ExecState that pertained at
        the time of their creation. Since ExecStates are transient, that
        design was totally bogus, and it would crash once the ExecState had
        been deallocated.

        Unfortunately, there's no clean solution to this problem, since
        the JSGlue API has no notion of state. The solution here is to use
        a shared, global ExecState for the purpose of JSGlue calls. Given
        the pre-existing limitations in the JSGlue API, this design
        shouldn't actually introduce any new limitations (see comments in
        JSValueWrapper.cpp).

        I tested with Quartz Composer and PAC files, neither of which are
