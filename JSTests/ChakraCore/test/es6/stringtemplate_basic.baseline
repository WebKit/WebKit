Tag function takes less formal arguments than string template produces:
callsiteObj[0]=str1 
callsiteObj[1]= str3 
callsiteObj[2]= str5
callsiteObj.raw[0]=str1 
callsiteObj.raw[1]= str3 
callsiteObj.raw[2]= str5
str2
callsiteObj[0]=str1 
callsiteObj[1]= str3 
callsiteObj[2]= str5 
callsiteObj[3]= str7
callsiteObj.raw[0]=str1 
callsiteObj.raw[1]= str3 
callsiteObj.raw[2]= str5 
callsiteObj.raw[3]= str7
str2

Simple tag function which assembles arguments:
str1 str2 str3 str4 str5 str6 str7 str8 str9

Simple tag function which assembles raw arguments:
str1 str2 str3 str4 str5 str6 str7 str8 str9

Substitution which calls a function:
thirty = 30. sixty = 60.

Function which returns a template literal:
8
600
hello world 1

Substitution calls a built-in operator:
typeof 1 == number.

Nested templates with substitutions:
this is a nested (nested template funcreturn!) string template... funcreturns!
