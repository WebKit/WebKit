Executing test #11 - Promise basic catch behavior
Executing test #12 - Promise chained catch behavior
Executing test #13 - Promise then and catch interleaved
Executing test #14 - Promise identity function is used when no success handler is provided
Executing test #15 - Promise thrower function is used when no error handler is provided
Executing test #16 - Promise.resolve creates a fulfilled resolved promise
Executing test #17 - Promise.resolve called with a promise returns the same promise
Executing test #18 - Promise.reject creates a fulfilled rejected promise
Executing test #19 - Promise.reject called with a promise returns a promise for that promise
Executing test #20 - Promise.race with an object containing a non-function iterator property
Executing test #21 - Promise.race with this argument missing the resolve function
Executing test #22 - Promise.race with this argument resolve function returning a non-object
Executing test #23 - Promise.race with this argument resolve function returning an object with no then function
Executing test #24 - Promise.race with an object containing an iterator that throws
Executing test #25 - Promise.race still returns a rejected promise if anything throws while iterating, even if resolved promises are encountered
Executing test #26 - Promise.race fulfills with the same value as the first encountered resolved promise
Executing test #27 - Promise.race fulfills with the same value as the first encountered resolved promise (promises complete async)
Executing test #28 - Promise.race fulfills with the same value as the first encountered rejected promise (promises complete async)
Executing test #29 - Promise.race passes each element in it's argument to Promise.resolve
Executing test #30 - Promise.all with an object containing a non-function iterator property
Executing test #31 - Promise.all with this argument missing the resolve function
Executing test #32 - Promise.all with this argument resolve function returning a non-object
Executing test #33 - Promise.all with this argument resolve function returning an object with no then function
Executing test #34 - Promise.all with an object containing an iterator that throws
Executing test #35 - Promise.all still returns a rejected promise if anything throws while iterating, even if resolved promises are encountered
Executing test #36 - Promise.all fulfills with the same value as the first encountered rejected promise
Executing test #37 - Promise.all fulfills with the same value as the first encountered rejected promise (async promises)
Executing test #38 - Promise.all fulfills when all promises in iterable fulfill
Executing test #39 - Promise.all passes each element in the arguments to Promise.resolve
Executing test #40 - Promise.resolve called with a thenable calls then on the thenable
Executing test #41 - Calling promise resolve function with thenable should call thenable.then
Executing test #42 - Promise.all doesn't call then for rejected promises
Executing test #43 - Promise.all with iterator that returns no items
Executing test #44 - Simple tampering of Promise.all promise changes resolved result value
Executing test #45 - Promise.all - can't prevent remaining elements counter from reaching zero
Executing test #46 - Promise from Promise.all never resolved before arguments
Executing test #47 - Promise from Promise.all never resolved if rejected promise in arguments
