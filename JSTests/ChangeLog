        The tests intentionally allocate a very large string.  Hence, for some memory
        limited configurations, it is perfectly reasonable for the test to throw an Out

        This patch adds a new way to run stress tests via the .wat text

        we can easily create wat files programatically and convert them

        stress/test-out-of-memory.js is not throwing OOM into ARMv7 and MIPS
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202011

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We are skipping this test into MIPS and ARMv7 because some of its assumptions
        are not valid for them. The current behavior of the test in those architectures
        is that it does not throw during `new ArrayBuffer(1000)` allocation site,
        because eden collection keeps happening between iterations. The collection
        is triggered on those architectures because the amount of stress 
        `new Promise` generates into GC limits is not enough to avoid them
        while loop is executing.

        Changing the size of `UInt8Array` from `80000000` to `160000000` can
        be an alternative fix to avoid collection happening during `ArrayBuffer`
        allocation loop, but we can't guarantee this test is always going to execute
        without error when Gigacage is disabled, given we can reach an OOM state in
        some allocations that need to succeed, making this test flaky for those

        [JSC] imports-oom.js intermittently fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196373

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        imports-oom.js ensures that a wasm module compilation / instantiation throws an OOM error instead of crashing when compiling / instantiating their entry points
        with extremely low executable memory amount. And this test expects we at least once successfully compile, instantiate, and execute a wasm module to test that
        wasm implementation is always throwing an OOM error. However, maybe due to wasm changes, the amount of executable memory consumed by wasm compilation is changed,
        and now we may encounter an OOM error at the first compilation. Since imports-oom.js randomize the amount of executable memory used by the generated wasm module,
        imports-oom.js intermittently fails when it first generates large wasm module which cannot be compiled.

        This patch reduces the maxParams from 32 to 8 to reduce the size of randomly generated wasm module. Since we repeatedly generate wasm modules, this test soon encounter
        an expected OOM error. But this avoids the situation that we get an OOM error when we compile a first wasm module.

        REGRESSION: stress/regress-178386.js is timing out on JSC debug bot
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194677
        <rdar://problem/48112492>

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Before r241233, String.fromCharCode (except for an empty string) always returns 16bit string.
        This makes the rope generated by padEnd 16bit. When we resolve the rope inside JSON.stringify,
        it immediately fails due the large size.

        After r241233, String.fromCharCode starts returning 8bit string if possible. So the rope becomes
        8bit, and we successfully resolve the rope in this case. Resolving such a large rope takes long
        time and that is why stress/regress-178386.js starts timing out. Note that, the test fails with
        OOM error anyway because JSON.stringify's builder overflows with such a large string input.

        This patch changes the test to produce 16bit string from String.fromCharCode.

        This test is painfully fragile: it tries to test that AssertNotEmpty on a constant produces valid B3 IR.
        The problem is that AssertNotEmpty is only created by DFGConstantFolding when it can simplify a CheckStructure, and constant folding is a bit capricious (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133947)

        Since the JIT is temporarily disabled on 32-bit platforms, these tests
        time out on the bots and need to be disabled. There's more tests
        disabled on arm because the timeout is longer on the mips bot (as the
        device is slower to start with), so many of the tests don't time out
        there.

        Skip test on systems with limited memory
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190310

        Invoking runDefault adds test to runlist, skipping the test in the next
        line does not prevent the test from executing. Change order of lines such
        that runDefault is only executed if test is not executed.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        DataView exposes NaN-representation, which is not necessarily the same on each
        architecture. Therefore move the check of the NaN-representation into its own
        file such that we can disable this test on MIPS where NaN-representation can be
        different on older CPUs.
