            WebAssembly: Import spec tests
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166395

            Rubber stamped by Keith Miller.

            This patch implements the Wasm spec's tests found here:
            https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/interpreter/test

            These tests are in .wast s-epxression format. To convert
            them to JS, I use a script from the wabt library, found here:
            https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/master/test/run-gen-spec-js.py

            I also added a script that automatically imports the tests as
            JS files. The inputs to the script is the path to the Wasm spec
            git repo and the path to the wabt git repo. This will make importing
            new tests easy in the future.

            The wasm spec imported is at commit: b055d01ea1dfdd7a5231ae779095435f836de97f
            The wabt used to do the import is at commit: 622b42dced6d793e9d49e9b1fd1d1524defd1387

        Move Wasm tests to JS
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164611

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch translates most of the tests from testWasm.cpp to the JS testing api. Most of the
        ommited tests were earliest tests, which tested trivial things, like adding two
        constants. Some tests are ommited for other reasons, however. These are:

        1) Tests using I64 since the testing api does not yet know how to handle 64-bit numbers.  2)
        Tests that would validate the memory of the module once wasm was done with it since that's
        not really possible in JS.

        In order to make such a translation easier this patch also adds some features to the JS
        testing api:

        1) Blocks can now be done lexically by adding a lambda as the last argument of the block
        opcode. For example one can do:
            ...
            .Block("i32", b => b.I32Const(1) )

        and the nested lambda will automatically have an end attached.

        2) The JS testing api can now handle inline signature types.

        3) Relocate some code to make it easier to follow and prevent 44 space indentation.

        4) Rename varuint/varint to varuint32/varint32, this lets them be directly called from the
        wasm.json without being remapped.

        5) Add support for Memory and Function sections to the Builder.

        6) Add support for local variables.

        On the JSC side, we needed to expose a new function to validate the compiled wasm code
        behaves the way we expect. At least until the JS Wasm API is finished. The new validation
        function, testWasmModuleFunctions, takes an array buffer containing the wasm binary, the
        number of functions in the blob and tests for each of those functions.

        WebAssembly JS API: implement more sections
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164023

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        On the JSC side:

         - Put in parser stubs for all WebAssembly sections.
         - Parse Import, Export sections.
         - Use tryReserveCapacity instead of reserve, and bail out of the parser if it fails. This prevents the parser from bringing everything down when faced with a malicious input.
         - Encapsulate all parsed module information into its own structure, making it easier to pass around (from parser to Plan to Module to Instance).
         - Create WasmFormat.cpp to hold parsed module information's dtor to avoid including WasmMemory.h needlessly.
         - parseCode: avoid overflow through function size.
         - Remove all remainders of polyfill-prototype-1, and update license.
         - Add missing WasmOps.h and WasmValidateInlines.h auto-generation for cmake build.

        On the Builder.js testing side:

         - Implement Type, Import (function only), Export (function only) sections.
         - Check section order and uniqueness.
         - Optionally auto-generate the Type section from subsequent Export / Import / Code entries.
         - Allow re-exporting an import.

        WebAssembly API: implement Instance

        As described in: https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/JS.md#webassemblyinstance-objects

         - Take ownership of Wasm::Plan's compilation result when successfully creating a JSWebAssemblyModule object.
         - Construct a basic Instance with a Module.
         - Handle second argument (importObject) of WebAssembly.Instance.
         - Add reference text from the spec to WebAssembly.Module's code.
         - Expose and test an empty 'exports' ModuleNamespaceObject on WebAssembly.Instance.

        The implementation isn't complete yet: it relies on further work for which I've filed bugs.

        WebAssembly JS API: implement Module

        This implementation allows us to:
         - Syncrhonously create a WebAssembly.Module with a typed array.
         - Creates a compilation plan.
         - Parse the Module and creates corresponding code.
         - Throw WebAssembly.CompileError with mildly helpful [*] error messages on
           failure.

        Consult the API documentation for expected behavior: https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/JS.md#webassemblymodule-constructor

        For now the implementation discards the generated code.

        The next steps will be:
         - Expose a Module's exports.
         - Implement WebAssembly.Instance, which allows instantiating and running a
           compiled Module.
         - Beef up the testing infrastructure under JSTests/wasm so that more complex
           modules can be created and tested (instead of writing the bits by hand).

        This patch also:
         - Adds assert.instanceof in assert.js.
         - Refactors Wasm::Parser and friends to accept const uint8_t* as well as a
           Vector, to avoid copying when invoked synchronously.
         - Remove useless Structure from some of the wasm constructors: they're already
           on the JSGlobalObject, visited properly and all.
         - Fix off-by-one error in parsing: Parser::parseUInt32 failed if the integer
           was exactly at end of file.

        WebAssembly API: implement exception constructors properly

         - Rename WebAssemblyObject to JSWebAssembly for consistency.
         - WebAssembly object now has its own prototype: add WebAssemblyPrototype, and
           use it to register JSWebAssembly's function properties through auto-generated
           .lut.h, instead of manually.
         - The error constructors used to throw (e.g. `new WebAssembly.CompileError()`).
         - Register WebAssembly's constructors from the global object, and hold a
           reference to their structure and prototype so that invoking the constructor
           can use the structure directly from the global object.
         - Add a prototype base field to global object creation. Previous ones all had
           Object's prototype as their base, but WebAssembly's error constructors have
           Error as their base.
         - Test for the error object's correctness.
         - Add missing #if ENABLE(WEBASSEMBLY)

        JavaScript WebAssembly API: baby steps

         - Expand WebAssembly constructors into their own files. This requires a lot of
           boilerplate, as well as adding the .lut.h files. All of the
           JSWebAssembly*.{h,cpp}, as well as Constructor and Prototype files, are
           currently the same between the 4 specified WebAssembly constructors. It'll be
           easy to implement individual functions on constructed objects as per the
           spec, and have each of these files diverge. The error constructors are also
           similar, except that their instance derives from ErrorInstance.
         - Use constructor macro when initializing the global object.
         - Dramatically improve testing of the WebAssembly API by checking for
           properties specified in the spec [*].
         - Clean up assert.js' exception testing.
         - Fix a copy-paste bug in wasm.json: floating-point const return values were
           swapped.

        Break some slow running tests into smaller bits so they don't time out.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162743

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        The following tests have shown to be slow running:
            op_div.js
            op_lshift.js
            op_mod.js

            op_rshift.js
            op_sub.js
            op_urshift

        These tests auto-generate permutations of values to apply to binary operations.
        They also test the operations with 3 permutations of value types:
            1. VarVar - both operands variables
            2. VarConst - variable operand 1, constant / literal operand 2
            3. ConstVar - constant / literal operand 1, variable operand 2

        We can prevent these tests from timing out by breaking each up to only run 1 of
        the 3 permutations of value types.

        Import Chakra tests to JSC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154697

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Added Chakra tests.  All these tests are under Chakra/test.  This is the same layout
        for tests in the Chakra tree.

        Created a ChakraCore.yaml file to be used with run-jsc-stress-tests.  This file contains
        the tests that are run when the original Chakra runtests.py script is run.  That script
        is the test driver for *nix platforms and does not attempt to run all tests or all
        variations of tests.  The runtest.py driver consults rlexe.xml files in each test
        subdirectory to determine the test to run, the options to pass to the test and how to
        determine pass/fail of the test.  With runtests.py as the start, tests that didn't
        pass directly where either skipped, with a message describing why or through 
        adjustments to the test infrastructure, as described below, where made to pass.
        
        The only modification to the test infrastrucutre are:

         1) Added simple mapping of Chakra expected exception text to JSC expected text in
            test/UnitTestFramework/UnitTestFramework.js.  It would make sense to also
            map some JSC specific exception text to more generic text for the cases where
            that text contains indetifier names or other source specific strings and the
            Chakra equivolent exception texts are generic.  
 
         2) Created JSC specific expected text files where it is clear that the text work
            as expected on JSC but the test output is different.  Typically the differences
            fall into three categories, different exception output, different output from
            toString() of a function, slight numeric differences, and test that rely on
            iteration order.

         3) Stripped the CR's from the CR-LF line terminations of the files.  

        No actual test .js files were modified.

        This bug affected function->activation references but not object->object field references,
        because object->object field references are !neededForMaterialization(). So, the object
        test always passed but the activation/function test used to always fail. It passes now.

        stress/random-53bit.js.ftl-no-cjit-no-inline-validate sometimes fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161436

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        The test checks Math.random() correctly produces 53bit random values.
        The test can fail by design, but this should be fairly rare.

        However, when introducing, we wrap the `test()` with 1e4 to ensure the FTL compilation, and this
        increases the failure rate. By increasing the MAX in the test, we make the failures much more rare case.

        And we also add getRandomSeed() and setRandomSeed(seed) JSC shell helpers to dump more useful information
        and reproduce the situation easily.

        We should not keep the JavaScript tests inside the Source/JavaScriptCore/ directory.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160372

        Rubber stamped by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch moves all the JavaScript tests from Source/JavaScriptCore/tests to
        a new top level directory, JSTests. Having the tests in the Source directory
        was both confusing an inconvenient for people that just want to checkout the
        source code of WebKit. Since there is no other obvious place to put all the
        JavaScript tests a new top level directory seemed the most sensible.

        * tests/: Deleted.
