        Previously, our backwards graph analysis was slightly wrong. The idea of
        backwards graph is that the root of the graph has edges to terminals in
        the original graph. And then the original directed edges in the graph are flipped.
    
        However, we weren't considering loops as a form of terminality. For example,
        we wouldn't consider an infinite loop as a terminal. So there were no edges
        from the root to a node in the infinite loop. This lead us to make mistakes
        when we used backwards dominators to compute control flow equivalence.
    
        This is better understood in an example:
    
        ```
        preheader:
        while (1) {
            if (!isCell(v))
                continue;
            load structure ID
            if (cond)
               continue;
            return
        }
        ```
    
        In the previous version of this algorithm, the only edge from the backwards
        root would be to the block containing the return. This would lead us to
        believe that the loading of the structureID backwards dominates the preheader,
        leading us to believe it's control flow equivalent to preheader. This is
        obviously wrong, since we can loop forever if "v" isn't a cell.
    
        The solution here is to treat any backedge in the graph as a "terminal" node.
        Since a backedge implies the existence of a loop.
    
        In the above example, the backwards root now has an edge to both blocks with
        "continue". This prevents us from falsely claiming that the return is control
        flow equivalent with the preheader.
    
        This patch uses DFS spanning trees to compute back edges. An edge
        u->v is a back edge when u is a descendent of v in the DFS spanning
        tree of the Graph.

    We are doing this because:

    2. SpeculativeJIT::compileAllocateNewArrayWithSize() (and the FTL equivalent)
       expects the array length to be less than MIN_ARRAY_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTION_LENGTH
       if we don't want to use an ArrayStorage shape.
    3. There's no reason why an array with spread needs to be that large anyway.
       MIN_ARRAY_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTION_LENGTH is plenty.
    
    In this patch, we also add a debug assert in compileAllocateNewArrayWithSize() and
    emitAllocateButterfly() to check for overflows.

    The bug here is in Yarr JIT backreference matching code.  We are incorrectly
    using a checkedOffset / inputPosition correction when checking for the available
    length left in a string.  It is improper to do these corrections as a backreference's
    match length is based on what was matched in the referenced capture group and not
    part of the checkedOffset and inputPosition computed when we compiled the RegExp.
    In some cases, the resulting incorrect calculation would allow us to go past
    the subject string's length.  Removed these adjustments.
    
    After writing tests for the first bug, found another bug where the non-greedy
    backreference backtracking code didn't do an "are we at the end of the input?" check.
    This caused an infinite loop as we'd jump from the backtracking code back to
    try matching one more backreference, fail and then backtrack.

    reportUsedRegisters uses reg liveness to eliminate loads/moves into dead
    registers. However, liveness can report incorrect results in certain
    scenarios when considering liveness at instruction boundaries. For example,
    it can go wrong when an Inst has a LateUse of a register and the following
    Inst has an EarlyDef of that same register. Such a scenario could lead us
    to incorrectly say the register is not live-in to the first Inst. Pad
    interference inserts Nops between such instruction boundaries that cause
    this issue.
    
    The test with this patch fixes the issue in reportUsedRegisters. This patch
    also conservatively makes it so that lowerAfterRegAlloc calls padInterference
    since it also reasons about liveness.

    JITStubRoutine's fields are marked only when JITStubRoutine::m_mayBeExecuting is true.
    This becomes true when we find the executable address in our conservative roots, which
    means that we could be executing it right now. This means that object liveness in
    JITStubRoutine depends on the information gathered in ConservativeRoots. However, our
    constraints are separated, "Conservative Scan" and "JIT Stub Routines". They can even
    be executed concurrently, so that "JIT Stub Routines" may miss to mark the actually
    executing JITStubRoutine because "Conservative Scan" finds it later.
    When finalizing the GC, we delete the dead JITStubRoutines. At that time, since
    "Conservative Scan" already finishes, we do not delete some JITStubRoutines which do not
    mark the depending objects. Then, in the next cycle, we find JITStubRoutines still live,
    attempt to mark the depending objects, and encounter the dead objects which are collected
    in the previous cycles.
    
    This patch removes "JIT Stub Routines" and merge it to "Conservative Scan". Since
    "Conservative Scan" and "JIT Stub Routines" need to be executed only when the execution
    happens (ensured by GreyedByExecution and CollectionPhase check), this change is OK for
    GC stop time.

    The Object Allocation Sinking phase may move allocations around inside
    of the program. However, it was not ensuring that it's still possible
    to walk the stack at the point in the program that it moved the allocation to.
    Certain InlineCallFrames rely on data in the stack when taking a stack trace.
    All allocation sites can do a stack walk (we do a stack walk when we GC).
    Conservatively, this patch says we're ok to move this allocation if we are
    moving within the same InlineCallFrame. We could be more precise and do an
    analysis of stack writes. However, this scenario is so rare that we just
    take the conservative-and-straight-forward approach of checking that the place
    we're moving to is the same InlineCallFrame as the allocation site.
    
    In general, this issue arises anytime we do any kind of code motion.
    Interestingly, LICM gets this right. It gets it right because the only
    InlineCallFrames we can't move out of are the InlineCallFrames that
    have metadata stored on the stack (callee for closure calls and argument
    count for varargs calls). LICM doesn't have this issue because it relies
    on Clobberize for doing its effects analysis. In clobberize, we model every
    node within an InlineCallFrame that meets the above criteria as reading
    from those stack fields. Consequently, LICM won't hoist any node in that
    InlineCallFrame past the beginning of the InlineCallFrame since the IR
    we generate to set up such an InlineCallFrame contains writes to that
    stack location.

    Source/JavaScriptCore:
    
    When pruning OSR Availability based on bytecode liveness, we accidentally clear the Availability (making it DeadFlush) instead of
    making it Availability::unavailable() (Making it ConflictingFlush). In OSRAvailabilityAnalysisPhase, we perform forward analysis.
    We first clear all the availability of basic blocks DeadFlush, which is an empty set. And then, we set operands in the root block
    ConflictingFlush. In this forward analysis, DeadFlush is BOTTOM, and ConflictingFlush is TOP. Then, we propagate information by
    merging availability until we reach to the fixed-point. As an optimization, we perform "pruning" of the availability in the head
    of the basic blocks. We remove availabilities of operands which are not live in the bytecode liveness at the head of the basic block.
    The problem is, when removing availabilities, we set DeadFlush for them instead of ConflictingFlush. Basically, it means that we set
    BOTTOM (an empty set) instead of TOP. Let's consider the following simple example. We have 6 basic blocks, and they are connected
    as follows.
    
        BB0 -> BB1 -> BB2 -> BB4
         |        \        ^
         v          > BB3 /
        BB5
    
    And consider about loc1 in FTL, which is required to be recovered in BB4's OSR exit.
    
        BB0 does nothing
            head: loc1 is dead
            tail: loc1 is dead
    
        BB1 has MovHint @1, loc1
            head: loc1 is dead
            tail: loc1 is live
    
        BB2 does nothing
            head: loc1 is live
            tail: loc1 is live
    
        BB3 has PutStack @1, loc1
            head: loc1 is live
            tail: loc1 is live
    
        BB4 has OSR exit using loc1
            head: loc1 is live
            tail: loc1 is live (in bytecode)
    
        BB5 does nothing
            head: loc1 is dead
            tail: loc1 is dead
    
    In our OSR Availability analysis, we always prune loc1 result in BB1's head since its head says "loc1 is dead".
    But at that time, we clear the availability for loc1, which makes it DeadFlush, instead of making it ConflictingFlush.
    
    So, the flush format of loc1 in each tail of BB is like this.
    
        BB0
            ConflictingFlush (because all the local operands are initialized with ConflictingFlush)
        BB1
            DeadFlush+@1 (pruning clears it)
        BB2
            DeadFlush+@1 (since it is propagated from BB1)
        BB3
            FlushedJSValue+@1 with loc1 (since it has PutStack)
        BB4
            FlushedJSValue+@1 with loc1 (since MERGE(DeadFlush, FlushedJSValue) = FlushedJSValue)
        BB5
            DeadFlush (pruning clears it)
    
    Then, if we go the path BB0->BB1->BB2->BB4, we read the value from the stack while it is not flushed.
    The correct fix is making availability "unavailable" when pruning based on bytecode liveness.

    [JSC] Do not use asArrayModes() with Structures because it discards TypedArray information

    (foo):
    
    Source/JavaScriptCore:
    
    When RegisteredStructureSet is filtered with AbstractValue, we use structure, SpeculationType, and ArrayModes.
    However, we use asArrayModes() function with IndexingMode to compute the ArrayModes in AbstractValue. This is
    wrong since this discards TypedArray ArrayModes. As a result, if RegisteredStructureSet with TypedArrays is
    filtered with ArrayModes of AbstractValue populated from TypedArrays, we filter all the structures out since
    AbstractValue's ArrayModes become NonArray, which is wrong with the TypedArrays' ArrayModes. This leads to
    incorrect FTL code generation with MultiGetByOffset etc. nodes because,
    
    1. AI think that this MultiGetByOffset never succeeds since all the values of RegisteredStructureSet are filtered out by the AbstractValue.
    2. AI says the state of MultiGetByOffset is invalid since AI think it never succeeds.
    3. So subsequent code becomes FTL crash code since AI think the execution should do OSR exit.
    4. Then, FTL emits the code for MultiGetByOffset, and emits crash after that.
    5. But in reality, the incoming value can match to the one of the RegisteredStructureSet value since (1)'s structures are incorrectly filtered by the incorrect ArrayModes.
    6. Then, the execution goes on, and falls into the FTL crash.
    
    This patch fixes the incorrect ArrayModes calculation by the following changes
    
    1. Rename asArrayModes to asArrayModesIgnoringTypedArrays.
    2. Fix incorrect asArrayModesIgnoringTypedArrays use in our code. Use arrayModesFromStructure instead.
    3. Fix OSR exit code which stores incorrect ArrayModes to the profiles.

    Source/JavaScriptCore:
    
    Even if the global lexical binding does not shadow the global property at that time, we need to clear the cached information in
    scope related operations since we may have a global property previously. Consider the following example,
    
        foo = 0;
        function get() { return foo; }
        print(get()); // 0
        print(get()); // 0
        delete globalThis.foo;
        $.evalScript(`const foo = 42;`);
        print(get()); // Should be 42, but it returns 0 if the cached information in get() is not cleared.
    
    To invalidate the cache easily, we introduce global lexical binding epoch. It is bumped every time we introduce a new lexical binding
    into JSGlobalLexicalEnvironment, since that name could shadow the global property name previously. In op_resolve_scope, we first check
    the epoch stored in the metadata, and go to slow path if it is not equal to the current epoch. Our slow path code convert the scope
    operation to the appropriate one even if the resolve type is not UnresolvedProperty type. After updating the resolve type of the bytecode,
    we update the cached epoch to the current one, so that we can use the cached information as long as we stay in the same epoch.
    
    In op_get_from_scope and op_put_to_scope, we do not use this epoch since Structure check can do the same thing instead. If op_resolve_type
    is updated by the epoch, and if it starts returning JSGlobalLexicalEnvironment instead JSGlobalObject, obviously the structure check fails.
    And in the slow path, we update op_get_from_scope and op_put_to_scope appropriately.
    
    So, the metadata for scope related bytecodes are eventually updated to the appropriate one. In DFG and FTL, we use the watchpoint based approach.
    In DFG and FTL, we concurrently attempt to get the watchpoint for the lexical binding and look into it by using `isStillValid()` to avoid
    infinite compile-and-fail loop.
    
    When the global lexical binding epoch overflows we iterate all the live CodeBlock and update the op_resolve_scope's epoch. Even if the shadowing
    happens, it is OK if we bump the epoch, since op_resolve_scope will return JSGlobalLexicalEnvironment instead of JSGlobalObject, and following
    structure check in op_put_to_scope and op_get_from_scope fail. We do not need to update op_get_from_scope and op_put_to_scope because of the same
    reason.

    DFGByteCodeParser omitted ToThis node when we have `ToThis(ToThis(value))`. This semantics is wrong if ToThis has different semantics
    in the sloppy mode and the strict mode. If we convert `ToThisInSloppyMode(ToThisInStrictMode(boolean))` to `ToThisInStrictMode(boolean)`,
    we get boolean instead of BooleanObject.
    
    This optimization is introduced more than 7 years ago, and from that, we have several optimizations that can remove such ToThis nodes
    in BytecodeParser, AI, and Fixup. Furthermore, this optimization is simply wrong since `toThis()` function of JSCell can be defined
    as they want. Before ensuring all the toThis function is safe, we should not fold `ToThis(ToThis(value))` => `ToThis(value)`.
    This patch just removes the problematic optimization. The performance numbers look neutral.

    Source/JavaScriptCore:
    
    Prior to this patch, the use kind for StringObjectUse implied that we
    do a StructureCheck on the input operand for the *original* StringObject
    structure. This is generally not how we use UseKinds, so it's no surprise
    that this is buggy. A UseKind should map to a set of SpeculatedTypes, not an
    actual set of structures. This patch changes the meaning of StringObjectUse
    to mean an object where jsDynamicCast<StringObject*> would succeed.
    
    This patch also fixes a bug that was caused by the old and weird usage of the
    UseKind to mean StructureCheck. Consider a program like this:
    ```
    S1 = Original StringObject structure
    S2 = Original StringObject structure with the field "f" added
    
    a: GetLocal()
    b: CheckStructure(@a, {S2})
    c: ToString(StringObject:@a)
    ```
    
    According to AI, in the above program, we would exit at @c, since
    StringObject:@a implies a structure check of {S1}, and the intersection
    of {S1} and {S2} is {}. So, we'd convert the program to be:
    ```
    a: GetLocal()
    b: CheckStructure(@a, {S2})
    c: Check(StringObject:@a)
    d: Unreachable
    ```
    
    However, AI would set the proof status of the StringObject:@a edge
    to be proven, since the SpeculatedType for @a is SpecStringObject.
    This was incorrect of AI to do because the SpeculatedType itself
    didn't capture the full power of StringObjectUse. However, having
    a UseKind mean CheckStructure is weird precisely because what AI was
    doing is a natural fit to how we typically we think about UseKinds.
    
    So the above program would then incorrectly be converted to this, and
    we'd crash when reaching the Unreachable node:
    ```
    a: GetLocal()
    b: CheckStructure(@a, {S2})
    d: Unreachable
    ```
    
    This patch makes it so that StringObjectUse just means that the object that
    filters through a StringObjectUse check must !!jsDynamicCast<StringObject*>.
    This is now in line with all other UseKinds. It also lets us simplify a bunch
    of other code that had weird checks for the StringObjectUse UseKind.
    
    This patch also makes it so that anywhere where we used to rely on
    StringObjectUse implying a structure check we actually emit an explicit
    CheckStructure node.

    If a block doesn't have any successors, it can't rely on the typical
    backwards liveness propagation that CombinedLiveness was doing. The phase
    first got what was live in bytecode and IR at the heads of each block. Then
    for each block, it made the live at tail the union of the live at head for
    each successor. For a terminal block though, this could be wrong. We could
    end up saying nothing is live even though many things may be live in bytecode.
    We must account for what's bytecode live at the end of the block. Consider a
    block that ends with:
    ```
    ForceOSRExit
    Unreachable
    ```
    
    Things may definitely be live in bytecode at the tail. However, we'll
    report nothing as being alive. This probably subtly breaks many analyses,
    but we have a test case of it breaking the interference analysis that
    the ArgumentsEliminationPhase performs.

    Source/JavaScriptCore:
    
    Previously, we assumed that lexical bindings in JSGlobalLexicalEnvironment cannot shadow existing global properties.
    However, it is wrong. According to the spec, we can shadow global properties if a property's attribute is configurable = true.
    For example, we execute two scripts.
    
    script1.js
    
        bar = 42;
        function load() { return bar; }
        print(bar); // 42
        print(load()); // 42
    
    script2.js
    
        let bar = 0; // This lexical binding can shadow the global.bar defined in script1.js
        print(bar); // 0
        print(load()); // 0
    
    In JSC, we cache GlobalProperty resolve type and its associated information in op_resolve_type, op_get_from_scope, and op_put_to_scope.
    They attempt to load a property from JSGlobalObject directly. However, once the newly added lexical binding starts shadowing this, our existing instructions
    become invalid since they do not respect JSGlobalLexicalEnvironment.
    
    In this patch, we fix this issue by introducing the following mechanisms.
    
    1. We have a HashMap<property name, watchpoint set> in JSGlobalObject. DFG and FTL create a watchpoint set with the property name if the generated code
    depends on GlobalProperty condition of op_resolve_scope etc. These watchpoint will be fired when the shadowing happens, so that our generated DFG and FTL
    code will be invalidated if it depends on the condition which is no longer valid.
    
    2. When we detect shadowing, we iterate all the live CodeBlocks which globalObject is the target one. And we rewrite instructions in them from GlobalProperty
    to GlobalLexicalVar (or Dynamic precisely). So, the subsequent LLInt code just works well. "Dynamic" conversion happens when your op_put_to_scope attempts to
    put a value onto a const lexical binding. This fails and it should throw a type error.
    
    3. GlobalProperty scope operations in Baseline JIT start checking ResolveType in metadata, and emit code for GlobalProperty and GlobalLexicalVar. Once the rewrite
    happens, baseline JIT continues working because it checks the rewritten metadata's ResolveType.
    
    We use this mechanism (which is similar to haveABadTime() thing) because,
    
    1. Shadowing should be super rare. Before r214145, we made these cases as SytaxError. Thus, before r214145, this type of code cannot be executed in WebKit.
    And the number of the live CodeBlocks for the given JSGlobalObject should be small. This supports introducing rather simple (but not so efficient) mechanism
    instead of the complicated one.
    
    2. Rewriting instructions immediately forces GlobalProperty => GlobalLexicalVar / Dynamic conversion in all the possible CodeBlock. This allows us to avoid
    compilation failure loop in DFG and FTL: DFG and FTL codes are invalidated by the watchpoint, but we may attempt to compile the code with the invalidated watchpoint
    and GlobalProperty status if we do not rewrite it. One possible other implementation is having and checking a counter in instruction, and every time we introduce
    a new shadow binding, bump the counter. And eventually executed instruction will go to the slow path and rewrite itself. However, this way leaves the not-executed-again-yet
    instructions as is, and DFG and FTL repeatedly fail to compile if we just watch the invalidated watchpoint for that. Rewriting all the existing GlobalProperty immediately
    avoids this situation easily.

        Since the JIT is temporarily disabled on 32-bit platforms, these tests
        time out on the bots and need to be disabled. There's more tests
        disabled on arm because the timeout is longer on the mips bot (as the

        This patch fixes the line number of syntax errors raised by the Function constructor,
