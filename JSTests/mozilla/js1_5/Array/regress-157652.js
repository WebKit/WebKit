* Date:    16 July 2002
* SUMMARY: Testing that Array.sort() doesn't crash on very large arrays
* See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157652
*
* How large can a JavaScript array be?
* ECMA-262 Ed.3 Final, Section 15.4.2.2 : new Array(len)
*
* This states that |len| must be a a uint32 (unsigned 32-bit integer).
* Note the UBound for uint32's is 2^32 -1 = 0xFFFFFFFF = 4,294,967,295.
*
* Check:
*              js> var arr = new Array(0xFFFFFFFF)
*              js> arr.length
*              4294967295
*
*              js> var arr = new Array(0x100000000)
*              RangeError: invalid array length
*
*
* We'll try the largest possible array first, then a couple others.
* We're just testing that we don't crash on Array.sort().
*
* Try to be good about memory by nulling each array variable after it is
* used. This will tell the garbage collector the memory is no longer needed.
*
* As of 2002-08-13, the JS shell runs out of memory no matter what we do,
* when trying to sort such large arrays.
*
* We only want to test that we don't CRASH on the sort. So it will be OK
* if we get the JS "out of memory" error. Note this terminates the test
* with exit code 3. Therefore we put
*
*                       |expectExitCode(3);|
*
* The only problem will arise if the JS shell ever DOES have enough memory
* to do the sort. Then this test will terminate with the normal exit code 0
* and fail.
*
* Right now, I can't see any other way to do this, because "out of memory"
* is not a catchable error: it cannot be trapped with try...catch.
*
*
* FURTHER HEADACHE: Rhino can't seem to handle the largest array: it hangs.
* So we skip this case in Rhino. Here is correspondence with Igor Bukanov.
* He explains that Rhino isn't actually hanging; it's doing the huge sort:

*
* This is due to different sorting algorithm Rhino uses when sorting
* arrays with length > Integer.MAX_VALUE. If length can fit Java int,
* Rhino first copies internal spare array to a temporary buffer, and then
* sorts it, otherwise it sorts array directly. In case of very spare
* arrays, that Array(big_number) generates, it is rather inefficient and
* generates OutOfMemory if length fits int. It may be worth in your case
* to optimize sorting to take into account array spareness, but then it
* would be a good idea to file a bug about ineficient sorting of spare
* arrays both in case of Rhino and SpiderMonkey as SM always uses a
* temporary buffer.
