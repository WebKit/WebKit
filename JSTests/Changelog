        We should not keep the JavaScript tests inside the Source/JavaScriptCore/ directory.

        Rubber stamped by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch moves all the JavaScript tests from Source/JavaScriptCore/tests to
        a new top level directory, JSTests. Having the tests in the Source directory
        was both confusing an inconvenient for people that just want to checkout the
        source code of WebKit. Since there is no other obvious place to put all the
        JavaScript tests a new top level directory seemed the most sensible.

        * tests/: Deleted.
