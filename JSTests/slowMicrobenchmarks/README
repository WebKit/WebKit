This directory contains tests that were once found in JSTests/microbenchmarks, but were pulled from there
because they are too slow to run regularly. Now they run only for JSC testing, and only with
defaultQuickRun.

Only move benchmarks back into JSTests/microbenchmarks if you get them to run in under 100ms on a modern
Mac.
