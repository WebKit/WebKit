// therefore never be collected. Currently this manifests on some of the MIPS
// test targets, with the main thread, where cruft on the main thread stack
// allocated by the OS and crt0 during process startup aliases some of the
// Arrays allocated in the loop. This would then cause the final check on the
// post GC heap size to fail, as some of the arrays cannot be collected, so ...
// increasing leniency on platforms where this manifests.
