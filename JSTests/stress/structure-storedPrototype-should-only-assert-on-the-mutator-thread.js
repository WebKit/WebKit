// Increase iterations to 10000 if you want the regression to reproduce more reliably.
// It can manifest in just a few iterations or may take a lot more iterations. We're
// reducing iterations here to shorten the execution time of this test for normal runs,
// with the tradeoff that some runs may not trigger the regression (if present). This is
// so that fixed builds (which is the likely case going forward) won't have to wait too
// long for this test to finish.
