 * NOTE: Migrating all tests to this API is necessary to prevent tests from hanging
 * indefinitely when a SAB is sent to a worker but the code in the worker attempts to
 * create a non-sharable TypedArray (something that is not Int32Array or BigInt64Array).
 * When that scenario occurs, an exception is thrown and the agent worker can no
 * longer communicate with any other threads that control the SAB. If the main
 * thread happens to be spinning in the $262.agent.waitUntil() while loop, it will never
 * meet its termination condition and the test will hang indefinitely.
 *
 * Because we've defined $262.agent.broadcast(SAB) in
 * https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/master/INTERPRETING.md, there are host implementations
 * that assume compatibility, which must be maintained.
