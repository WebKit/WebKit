var __the__raven = "	Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary," +
        "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore," +
        "While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping," +
        "As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door." +
        "`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -" +
        "Only this, and nothing more.'" +
        "Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December," +
        "And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor." +
        "Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow" +
        "From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -" +
        "For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -" +
        "Nameless here for evermore." +
        "\n" +
        "And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain" +
        "Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;" +
        "So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating" +
        "`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -" +
        "Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -" +
        "This it is, and nothing more,'" +
        "Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer," +
        "`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;" +
        "But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping," +
        "And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door," +
        "That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -" +
        "Darkness there, and nothing more." +
        "\n" +
        "Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing," +
        "Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before" +
        "But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token," +
        "And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'" +
        "This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'" +
        "Merely this and nothing more." +
        "\n" +
        "Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning," +
        "Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before." +
        "`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;" +
        "Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -" +
        "Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -" +
        "'Tis the wind and nothing more!'" +
        "\n" +
        "Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter," +
        "In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore." +
        "Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;" +
        "But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -" +
        "Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -" +
        "Perched, and sat, and nothing more." +
        "\n" +
        "Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling," +
        "By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore," +
        "`Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven." +
        "Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -" +
        "Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'" +
        "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'" +
        "-n" +
        "Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly," +
        "Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;" +
        "For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being" +
        "Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -" +
        "Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door," +
        "With such name as `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only," +
        "That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour." +
        "Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -" +
        "Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -" +
        "On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'" +
        "Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken," +
        "`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store," +
        "Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster" +
        "Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -" +
        "Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore" +
        "Of \"Never-nevermore.\"'" +
        "\n" +
        "But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling," +
        "Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;" +
        "Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking" +
        "Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -" +
        "What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore" +
        "Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing" +
        "To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;" +
        "This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining" +
        "On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er," +
        "But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er," +
        "She shall press, ah, nevermore!" +
        "\n" +
        "Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer" +
        "Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor." +
        "`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee" +
        "Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!" +
        "Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'" +
        "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -" +
        "Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore," +
        "Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -" +
        "On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -" +
        "Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'" +
        "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!" +
        "By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -" +
        "Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn," +
        "It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -" +
        "Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?'" +
        "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -" +
        "`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!" +
        "Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!" +
        "Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!" +
        "Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'" +
        "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'" +
        "\n" +
        "And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting" +
        "On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;" +
        "And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming," +
        "And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;" +
        "And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor" +
        "Shall be lifted - nevermore!"
