    String.prototype.split (separator, limit) returns an Array object into which substrings of the result of converting this object to a string have
    been stored. The substrings are determined by searching from left to right for occurrences of
    separator; these occurrences are not part of any substring in the returned array, but serve to divide up
    the string value. The value of separator may be a string of any length or it may be a RegExp object
