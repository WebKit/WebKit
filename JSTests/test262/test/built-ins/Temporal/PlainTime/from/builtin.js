description: Tests that Temporal.PlainTime.from meets the requirements for built-in objects
info: |
    Built-in functions that are not constructors do not have a "prototype" property unless
    otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.

    Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function is a built-in
    function object with the characteristics described in 10.3. Unless specified otherwise, the
    [[Extensible]] internal slot of a built-in object initially has the value true.

    Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in constructor has the
    Function prototype object [...] as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot.
