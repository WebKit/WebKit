    When the Function constructor is called with one argument then body be that argument and the following steps are taken:
    i) Call ToString(body)
    ii) If P is not parsable as a FormalParameterListopt then throw a SyntaxError exception
    iii) If body is not parsable as FunctionBody then throw a SyntaxError exception
    iv) Create a new Function object as specified in 13.2 with parameters specified by parsing P as a FormalParameterListopt and body specified by parsing body as a FunctionBody.
    Pass in a scope chain consisting of the global object as the Scope parameter
