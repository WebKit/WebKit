  A multi-line comment containing a line separator should be considered a
  LineTerminator
info: >
  Comments behave like white space and are discarded except that, if a
  MultiLineComment contains a line terminator code point, then the entire
  comment is considered to be a LineTerminator for purposes of parsing by the
  syntactic grammar.
