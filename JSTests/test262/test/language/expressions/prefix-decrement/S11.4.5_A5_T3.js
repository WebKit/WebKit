es5id: S11.4.5_A5_T3
description: >
    Evaluating LeftHandSideExpression lhs returns Reference type; Reference
    base value is an environment record and environment record kind is
    object environment record. PutValue(lhs, newValue) uses the initially
    created Reference even if the environment binding is no longer present.
    Binding in surrounding object environment record is not changed.
