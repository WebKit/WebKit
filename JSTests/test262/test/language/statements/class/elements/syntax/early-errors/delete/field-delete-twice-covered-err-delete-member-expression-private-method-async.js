      UnaryExpression : delete UnaryExpression

      It is a Syntax Error if the UnaryExpression is contained in strict mode
      code and the derived UnaryExpression is
      PrimaryExpression : IdentifierReference ,
      MemberExpression : MemberExpression.PrivateName , or
      CallExpression : CallExpression.PrivateName .

      It is a Syntax Error if the derived UnaryExpression is
      PrimaryExpression : CoverParenthesizedExpressionAndArrowParameterList and
      CoverParenthesizedExpressionAndArrowParameterList ultimately derives a
      phrase that, if used in place of UnaryExpression, would produce a
      Syntax Error according to these rules. This rule is recursively applied.
