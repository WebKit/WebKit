Unless otherwise specified, this value is the name that is given to the function in this specification. Functions that are specified as get or set accessor functions of built-in properties have "get " or "set " prepended to the property name string.
    Unless otherwise specified, the name property of a built-in function object, if it exists, has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: true }.
