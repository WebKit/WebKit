description: >
  In the ISO 8601 week calendar, calendar week number 1 of a calendar year is 
  the week including the first Thursday of that year (based on the principle 
  that a week belongs to the same calendar year as the majority of its calendar 
  days). Because of this, some calendar days of the first calendar week of a 
  calendar year may be part of the preceding date calendar year, and some 
  calendar days of the last calendar week of a calendar year may be part of
  the next calendar year.
