    a. Let list be ! AvailableCurrencies( ).

  9. Return ! CreateArrayFromList( list ).

  AvailableCurrencies ( )
    The AvailableCurrencies abstract operation returns a List, ordered as if an
    Array of the same values had been sorted using %Array.prototype.sort% using
    undefined as comparefn, that contains unique, well-formed, and upper case
    canonicalized 3-letter ISO 4217 currency codes, identifying the currencies
    for which the implementation provides the functionality of Intl.DisplayNames
    and Intl.NumberFormat objects.

// Note: We can't test that additional currency values not present in |currencies|
// aren't supported by Intl.NumberFormat, because PartitionNumberPattern defaults
// to using the currency code itself when the currency is unsupported:
//
// PartitionNumberPattern, step 8.k.iii:
// Let cd be an ILD String value representing currency after x in currencyDisplay form,
// which may depend on x in languages having different plural forms. If the
// implementation does not have such a representation of currency, use currency itself.
