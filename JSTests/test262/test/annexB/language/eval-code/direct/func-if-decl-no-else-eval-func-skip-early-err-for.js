description: Extension not observed when creation of variable binding would produce an early error (for statement) (IfStatement without an else clause in eval code)
esid: sec-functiondeclarations-in-ifstatement-statement-clauses
flags: [generated, noStrict]
info: |
    The following rules for IfStatement augment those in 13.6:

    IfStatement[Yield, Return]:
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) FunctionDeclaration[?Yield] else Statement[?Yield, ?Return]
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) Statement[?Yield, ?Return] else FunctionDeclaration[?Yield]
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) FunctionDeclaration[?Yield] else FunctionDeclaration[?Yield]
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) FunctionDeclaration[?Yield]


    B.3.3.3 Changes to EvalDeclarationInstantiation

    [...]
    ii. If replacing the FunctionDeclaration f with a VariableStatement that
        has F as a BindingIdentifier would not produce any Early Errors for
        body, then
