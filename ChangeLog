        Remove the need for defining USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215439

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When building WebKit for XCBuild, we currently require that the
        external build system (such as the Makefile, build-webkit, etc.)
        defines the USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM=YES build setting. This build setting
        controls parts of our build instructions that are sensitive to when
        XCBuild or the Legacy build system are being used. Notably, we need to
        know when to use our custom “copy and modify” scripts with copying
        certain header files (used with the Legacy build system) vs. using the
        enhanced Copy Headers build phase that’s enabled with
        APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_HEADERS=YES (introduced with and used by XCBuild).
        The choice of which method to copy headers is used is controlled by
        USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM.

        There is no built-in build setting that we can probe to help us
        determine which approach to take when copying and modifying headers,
        which is why we need to define USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM ourselves. But it
        turns out that we can *detect* which build system is being used by
        taking advantage of a subtle difference between the two systems. As
        noted in:

            https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/build-system-release-notes-for-xcode-10

            “When an .xcconfig file contains multiple assignments of the same
             build setting, later assignments using $(inherited) or
             $(<setting_name>) will inherit from earlier assignments in the
             .xcconfig. The legacy build system caused every use of
             $(inherited) or $(<setting_name>) skip any other values defined
             within the .xcconfig.”

        This difference can be exploited as follows:

            WK_WHICH_BUILD_SYSTEM = not_
            WK_WHICH_BUILD_SYSTEM = $(inherited)legacy
            WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM = $(WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM_$(WK_WHICH_BUILD_SYSTEM))
            WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM_legacy = NO
            WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM_not_legacy = YES

        We can then use WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM where we used to use the
        externally-defined USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Switch from the "legacy" Xcode build system to the "new" build system
        (also known as "XCBuild"). Switching to the new system speeds up
        builds by a small percentage, better validates projects for
        build-related issues (such as dependency cycles), lets WebKit benefit
        from future improvements in XCBuild such as those coming from the
        underlying llbuild open source project, and prepares us for any other
        tools built for this new ecosystem.

        Specific changes:

        - Remove Xcode project and workspace settings that selected the Build
          system, allowing the default to take hold (which is currently the
          New build system).
        - Updated webkitdirs.pm with a terser check for Xcode version.
        - Update build-webkit and Makefile.shared to be explicit when using
          the old build system (no longer treat it as a default or fall-back
          configuration).
        - Update various xcconfig files similarly to treat the default as
          using the new build system.
        - Update various post-processing build steps to check for Xcode 11.4
          and to no longer treat the default as using the old build system.

        [GTK][CMake] Introduce an USE_GTK4 build option
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210154

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Do the bare minimum changes to build against GTK4 and produce a WebKit port library with a
        different name than GTK3 builds. Note that this does not attempt to make the built artifacts
        parallel-installable yet, though at least the main library, headers, and the pkg-config .pc
        file should be safe to install. The final names for built artifacts for GTK4 builds may
        still change.

        * Source/cmake/OptionsGTK.cmake: Add a new USE_GTK4 public build option, which defaults
        to FALSE for now, and depending on its value choose the required version of GTK and set
        a different API version versions. This is enough to build a library with a different
        name (libwebkit2gtk-5.0 vs. libwebkit2gtk-4.0) when GTK4 is in use.

        Switch from the "legacy" Xcode build system to the "new" build system
        (also known as "XCBuild"). Switching to the new system speeds up
        builds by a small percentage, better validates projects for
        build-related issues (such as dependency cycles), lets WebKit benefit
        from future improvements in XCBuild such as those coming from the
        underlying llbuild open source project, and prepares us for any other
        tools built for this new ecosystem.

        Specific changes:

        - Remove Xcode project and workspace settings that selected the Build
          system, allowing the default to take hold (which is currently the
          New build system).
        - Updated webkitdirs.pm with a terser check for Xcode version.
        - Update build-webkit and Makefile.shared to be explicit when using
          the old build system (no longer treat it as a default or fall-back
          configuration).
        - Update various xcconfig files similarly to treat the default as
          using the new build system.
        - Update various post-processing build steps to check for Xcode 11.4
          and to no longer treat the default as using the old build system.

        [Curl] Add TLS debugging feature to log encryption keys
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208192

        Reviewed by Fujii Hironori.

        This patch enables recording encryption keys on curl port.
        When you set key log file path to environment variable SSLKEYLOGFILE on curl port, network process writes encryption keys into the path.
        The key log file follows the NSS key log format and this feature is as same as Chrome and Firefox have.

        See also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format

        Test: No tests for this debugging feature. We have to check manually if the log file is generate.

        Fix issue in cmake build for checking ccache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208377

        Reviewed by Carlos Alberto Lopez Perez.

        If either of the "readlink" or "which" commands fail when looking for the ccache prefix
        the output variables will be empty and an invalid expression will be provided to CMake.
        e.g. we will get something like:
        if ("0" "EQUAL" "0" "AND" "1" "EQUAL" "0" "AND" "STREQUAL" "/usr/local/bin/ccache")

        The fix is to wrap the output variables in the quotes when unboxing them in the if.

        [CMake] Use builtin targets
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205166

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Add WebKitFindPackage.cmake which wraps CMake's find_package to provide targets
        for common libraries.

        Rationale:
        1. There are a number of libraries which are found using CMake's internal Find modules
           that contain targets but not all of them are available in the minimum version of
           CMake we support, 3.10.
        2. Updating to CMake 3.12 or higher is not possible due to the WebKit GTK's support
           policy. It looks like the next time we can bump the version is spring 2021.
        3. Apple builds, both Mac and Windows, have libraries that won't be found using the
           stock CMake modules. AppleWin also has internal builds where all libraries have
           a DEBUG_SUFFIX of _debug that would not be picked up.

        In the implementation of find_package any Apple specific requirements are dealt with
        and the expected CMake values are populated. For all other cases CMake's original
        find_package is called so there's no behavior change. Afterwards if there is a library
        that has a target but the target was not created it is created from the definitions
        that are present from the find module at CMake 3.10.

        This makes it so all ports consistently have targets across all versions of CMake
        above the current minimum.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207100

        Reviewed by Konstantin Tokarev.

        WebKit needs OpenJPEG 2.2.0 or later versions, but it is possible for a
        system to have both OpenJPEG 1 and OpenJPEG 2 installed. However, some
        distributions do not put OpenJPEG 1 under a versioned directory and
        put its header file directly under /usr/include or /usr/local/include.
        Since CMake prefers its prefixes to paths given in HINTS, it is possible
        that openjpeg.h from OpenJPEG 1 is found before the one from OpenJPEG 2,
        causing WebKit to fail to build because of using the wrong header file.

        Resolve the problem by checking opj_config.h instead of openjpeg.h.
        OpenJPEG 1.5 does not have opj_config.h, so only OpenJPEG 2 can be
        found. This also makes it consistent with the code below which already
        uses opj_config.h.

        [Win][CMake] Build WebCore as an OBJECT library for WinCairo port
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203663

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        WebCore is using __declspec(dllexport) to export symbols, but it
        is built as a static library rather than a DLL. If any symbols in
        an object file aren't referenced from WebKit.dll, they won't be
        included in WebKit.dll.

        This issue can be solved either by using OBJECT library for
        WebCore or using /WHOLEARCHIVE:WebCore.lib for WebKit.

        This change takes OBJECT library approach becuase it doesn't
        generate unnecessary static libs (WebCore.lib) and it's already
        used for non-unified source builds for the library size issue (Bug
        196866 Comment 4).

        However, AppleWin can't use it because the Apple internal builds
        need to generate the static libs and OBJECT library doesn't work
        well with makesafeseh.obj.

        * Source/cmake/OptionsWin.cmake: Removed code overriding library types.
        * Source/cmake/OptionsWinCairo.cmake: Use OBJECT library types for WebCore and WebCoreTestSupport.

        [GTK][WPE] Gtk-Doc fails with build options which need cooperation between CFLAGS and LDFLAGS

        Only CFLAGS was being set before trying to generate the documentation
        but not LDFLAGS, which could cause errors when gtk-doc tries to link
        a generated program when the compiler flags would also require usage
        of certain linker flags later on.

           standard or even particular C++ features to be availabe (e.g. Qt

        [WPE][GTK] Bump minimum versions of GLib, GTK, libsoup, ATK, GStreamer, and Cairo
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199094

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        We can remove a lot of preprocessor guards in our code if we bump the minimum required
        versions of certain dependencies:

        GStreamer 1.8 -> 1.10
        GTK 3.6 -> 3.22
        ATK 2.16
        libsoup 2.42 -> 2.54
        glib 2.40 -> 2.44
        cairo 1.14

        I'm being extremely conservative with all these dependency bumps. All of these versions are
        already available in Debian Stretch, which we will soon no longer support building on anyway
        due to the impending GCC 7 requirement. Dependencies are also bumped no further than we
        actually have guards for. For example, ATK 2.22 is available in Stretch, but the highest
        ATK_CHECK_VERSION guards we use below 2.22 are for 2.16, so I set the min version to 2.16.

        We still have a few preprocessor guards remaining for everything here except glib and cairo,
        but this removes the vast majority of them. Deleting code is fun!

        purpose macro that copies files to a destination. WEBKIT_COPY_FILES removes the
        requirement of a target being passed in so there is no longer any implicit dependency
        between the target and the copying. Instead the dependencies need to be explicit.

        This opens the macro up for use by third party libraries and for copying other files
        to a destination.

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        Time for part #2! This change was defeated for GTK and WPE by the code that makes the
        options public. We have three options: (a) duplicate the architecture check currently in
        WebKitFeatures.cmake in both OptionsGTK.cmake and OptionsWPE.cmake, (b) rely on the result
        of that check in OptionsGTK.cmake and OptionsWPE.cmake by using ENABLE_JIT_DEFAULT and
        USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC_DEFAULT, a fragile encapsulation violation, or (c) just make the options
        private. They have been public up until now because they needed to be turned off on
        unsupported architectures. But now they are off by default and enabled only for particular
        whitelisted architectures, so they shouldn't be needed anymore.

        Note we have to hide ENABLE_SAMPLING_PROFILER as well, since it needs to match the value of
        ENABLE_JIT. Again, this is handled properly in WebKitFeatures.cmake, and defeated here in
        OptionsGTK.cmake. (This is not a problem for WPE.)

        [CMake] Replace AVFoundationSupport.py using CMake

        Reviewed by Per Arne Vollan.

        Adds CMake checks for AVFoundation support replacing the functionality
        of AVFoundationSupport.py.

        CMake is used to detect the symbols expected with the HAVE_* checks for
        AVFoundation support. This involves creating source files that will be
        built which verifies the presence of symbols. For Apple frameworks it
        is customary to include the main framework file which includes the
        other associated headers.

        The check for HAVE_AVCFPLAYERITEM_CALLBACK_VERSION_2 involves looking
        for an enumeration which a symbol check cannot detect. Instead a small
        program is used which will compile and link when the version 2
        enumeration is present.

        Build system support for LTO
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=187785
        <rdar://problem/42353132>

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        Add support for building WebKit with LTO (Link Time Optimization) on
        macOS and iOS. Both variations are supported: "full" (which performs
        all the optimizations it can regardless of the cost) and "thin" (which
        sacrifices some optimizations in order to recover build time and
        memory usage).

        By default, LTO is disabled for Debug and Release builds, but is
        enabled for Production builds. For Debug and Release builds, LTO is
        controlled as follows:

        - When using `make` from the command line, include
          WK_LTO_MODE={none,thin,full}. For example, `make WK_LTO_MODE=full
          release`. As when specifying debug/release, the LTO configuration
          information is written to the WebKitBuild directory and is used as
          the default on the next build if a new setting is not specified.

        - When using `build-webkit`, include --lto-mode={none,thin,full} on
          the command line. For example, `build-webkit --lto-mode=full ...`.

        - When using Xcode, create a configuration file called
          LocalOverrides.xcconfig at the root level of your WebKit checkout
          directory. Include within it a line that says:

            WK_LTO_MODE={none,thin,full}

          For example:

            WK_LTO_MODE=full

        Note that LocalOverrides.xcconfig is included in the .gitignore file,
        so you won't accidentally check your changes into source control.

        Enabling LTO can greatly increase build times, especially when using
        "full" LTO with 32GB or RAM or less. Following is a table of full
        build times for a Release build on a fully decked-out 2017 iMac Pro:

            LTO     macOS      iOS
            -----  -------   -------
            None:   9m 11s   14m 11s
            Thin:  11m 44s   17m 30s
            Full:  21m 39s   28m 56s

        Incremental times are affected even more greatly. The actual
        optimization and compilation of LLVM bitcode is moved to the link
        phase, meaning that the link phase, which previously took only
        seconds, can now take many minutes. It's for this reason that LTO is
        not enabled in Debug and Release builds, since incremental builds are
        an integral part of those configurations. However, using the
        mechanisms described above, developers can perform optional LTO builds
        if needed to track down build or runtime issues in that configuration.

        * .gitignore: Include LocalOverrides.xcconfig.
        * Makefile.shared: Add support for WK_LTO_MODE on the command line.

        The XCode build is still not using C++ 17, it's been several months since CMake ports
        switched, everything builds fine without changes if we switch back, and there have been some
        unfixed problems. Let's go back to C++ 14 for now. We can switch back to C++ 17 whenever we
        are ready to switch over XCode at the same time, to ensure we don't wind up with divergent
        behavior for std::optional.

        Store port-specific test expectations and test manifest files for the

        directory.

        TestExpectations.json file lists all the failing or disabled tests
        or subtests that are to be expected in the test run. This information is
        parsed in the run-web-platform-tests script and used to build
        test-specific metadata files (ending with .ini) inside a temporary
        directory that is then used during the test run. JSON format is used to
        follow the WebDriver test suite in how it manages expectations, and to
        avoid having to manually manage .ini files for every deviant test case.

        TestManifest.ini file is used to fine-tune which tests are to be enabled
        by default. For the GTK+ port, we currently disable all tests by default
        but then specifically enable tests under the 2dcontext and WebCryptoAPI
        directories. This will allow for gradual enabling of further tests.

        use the following C++17 language features (I removed some
        uninteresting ones):

         - New auto rules for direct-list-initialization
         - static_assert with no message
         - typename in a template template parameter
         - Nested namespace definition
         - Attributes for namespaces and enumerators

         - __has_include in preprocessor conditional
         - Differing begin and end types in range-based for

        Consult the Tony Tables [3] to see before / after examples.

        Of course we can use any library feature if we're willing to
        import them to WTF (and they don't require language support).

        [GTK] check target looks broken
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184407

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        It's pretty clear that nobody has been using check for a long time.

        We got rid of check-for-webkitdom-api-breaks a long time ago, when we stopped autogenerating
        the DOM API, but it's still used in the check target. Fix this.

        Also, the check target for some reason runs itself from the Source subdirectory of the
        builddir, but the test script expects to be run from the toplevel build directory. Fix this
        too.

        Add VERBATIM for good measure.

        Build JSC as a shared library.

        Stop using -fvisibility=hidden. This is a shame, but it is causing problems that I don't
        know how to fix.

        REGRESSION(r226306)[Win][CMake] Unnecessary recompilations triggered by unconditionally copied header files of DerivedSources
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181324

        Reviewed by Konstantin Tokarev.

        r226306 changed to use cmake -E copy to copy header files of
        DerivedSources. This command copies files unconditionally, then
        introduced unnecessary recompilations.

        * Source/cmake/WebKitMacros.cmake: Use copy_if_different instead of copy.
