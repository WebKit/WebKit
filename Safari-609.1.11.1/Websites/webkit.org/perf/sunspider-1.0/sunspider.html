<h2><span id="logo">&#x2600;</span>SunSpider 1.0 JavaScript Benchmark</h2>

<p>This is SunSpider, a JavaScript benchmark. This benchmark tests the
core JavaScript language only, not the DOM or other browser APIs. It
is designed to compare different versions of the same browser, and
different browsers to each other. Unlike many widely available
JavaScript benchmarks, this test is:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Real World<dt>
<dd>This test mostly avoids microbenchmarks, and tries to focus on
the kinds of actual problems developers solve with JavaScript today,
and the problems they may want to tackle in the future as the language
gets faster. This includes tests to generate a tagcloud from JSON
input, a 3D raytracer, cryptography tests, code decompression, and
many more examples. There are a few microbenchmarkish things, but they
mostly represent real performance problems that developers have
encountered.</dd>

<dt>Balanced<dt>
<dd>This test is balanced between different areas of the language and
different types of code. It's not all math, all string processing, or
all timing simple loops. In addition to having tests in many
categories, the individual tests were balanced to take similar amounts
of time on currently shipping versions of popular browsers.</dd>

<dt>Statistically Sound<dt>
<dd>One of the challenges of benchmarking is knowing how much noise
you have in your measurements. This benchmark runs each test multiple
times and determines an error range (technically, a 95% confidence
interval). In addition, in comparison mode it tells you if you have
enough data to determine if the difference is statistically
significant.</dd>

<p><b>Current version - sunspider-1.0:</b> <a href="sunspider-1.0/driver.html">Start Now!</a><br>
<small>(When you run the benchmark, be patient - it loops through all of the
test cases five times and can take a minute or longer to complete.)</small></p>
