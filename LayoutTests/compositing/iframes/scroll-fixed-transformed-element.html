  <!-- This test reproduces https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84979.
       In this bug, clipRects that were supposed to be "infinite" were being scrolled,
       causing them to no longer be considered infinite. As a result, fixed-position
       layers with transformed elements would have problems.

       In this layout test, the fixed-position green box should fill the iframe, thus
       hiding the red background.
