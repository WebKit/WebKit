   If the test passes you should see a solid green square with no blue on its edges.

   The image sits such that it completely fills a tile in the white background layer. However some of the edge pixels of the box are only partially
   filled, so they end up being blended with part of the pixel behind them. If culling treats them as opaque, then the background tile below is culled
   inappropriately, and the edge pixels come out mixed with blue since the partial pixels behind were not filled.
