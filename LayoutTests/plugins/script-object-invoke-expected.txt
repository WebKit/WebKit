Test proper tracking of script NPObjects

Test 1: Ensure that script NPObjects are properly tracked (i.e. added to
        the live objects map in V8).

Test 2: Test tracking of derived NPObjects by invoking a method on a
        script object and passing it an internally created NPObject.

SUCCESS
