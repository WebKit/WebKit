SUCCESS: Exception caught: Error: plugin object testThrowExceptionProperty SUCCESS
One could expect exceptions to be raised in the below cases, too - but Firefox doesn't do that in most of these (I do get an exception in the first case, but that's inconsistent with not getting it in the seconfd one).
No exception caught on getting via testCallback.
No exception caught on setting via testCallback.
No exception caught on getting via testGetBrowserProperty.
No exception caught on setting via testSetBrowserProperty.
