ALERT: Made it back!
This test - assuming it will pass - does the following:
1 - Has nested plugin elements
2 - Leaves the page, and the page enters the page cache
3 - Returns, pulling the page from the page cache
4 - Doesn't crash

If you're not running under DRT, you'll need to leave the page then return to it yourself.
Some fallback text to force a renderer.

(Yes, the extreme number of object elements are necessary to more reliably reproduce the crash. Leave them.)
