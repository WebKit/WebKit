CONSOLE MESSAGE: PLUGIN: NPP_Destroy
This tests that objects from plugin objects are properly cleaned up.

Example:
   plugin
     ------- (Creates) ------ Object1
                                  ------- (Creates) ------ Object2

It is important that both Object1 and Object2 cleanup as a result of
cleaning up the plugin.

SUCCESS
