This test check the following situation:

First you navigate to a page (first-page.html).
Then you go to another page (other-page.html).
You repeat previous steps again (going to first-page.html and then to other-page.html).
Finally you click back.
The problem was that the resource load callbacks when going back to the cached main resource were not being called.

See bug #112418.
