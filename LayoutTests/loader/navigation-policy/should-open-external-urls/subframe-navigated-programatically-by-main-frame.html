This page has does not have the "should open external URLs" flag set.<br>
It navigates to a 2nd page that does have the flag set.<br>
That 2nd page contains an iframe, and the main frame programatically navigates the iframe to a 3rd document.<br>
The "should open external URLs" flag should be set because the programatic navigation initiated from the main frame and the flag should propagate.<br>
