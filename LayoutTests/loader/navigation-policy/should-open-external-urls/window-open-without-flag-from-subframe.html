This page opens a 2nd page with the "should open external URLs" flag set to false.<br>
That page has a subframe which calls window.open to a 3rd page.<br>
That 3rd page should have the flag set to false because the subframe initiated the load, *and* because the main frame did not have the flag set.<br>
