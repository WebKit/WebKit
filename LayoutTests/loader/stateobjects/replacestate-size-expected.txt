Test should not crash.
replaceState() should not always count against the global quota. Instead it should literally replace the most recent state object added.
Pushing 63+mb of state objects (but less than 64mb)
Replacing the last state object with one that should fit
It fit
Replacing the last state object with one that should not fit
Expected exception replacing the last state object: QuotaExceededError: Attempt to store more data than allowed using history.replaceState()
