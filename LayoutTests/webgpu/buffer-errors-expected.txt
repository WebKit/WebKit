CONSOLE MESSAGE: GPUDevice.createBuffer(): Buffer cannot have both MAP_READ and MAP_WRITE usage!

PASS GPUBuffers can be created with both read-only and STORAGE usages.
PASS unmap on already unmapped, mappable GPUBuffer should not generate error.
PASS GPUBuffer created via createBufferMapped cannot be remapped.
PASS GPUBufferDescriptor with both MAP_READ and MAP_WRITE usage should fail.
PASS Too-large GPUBufferDescriptor size should fail with out-of-memory error.
PASS mapReadAsync on non-MAP_READ GPUBuffer should fail.
PASS mapWriteAsync on non-MAP_WRITE GPUBuffer should fail.
PASS unmap on non-mappable GPUBuffer should fail.
PASS createBufferMapped: non-4-byte-aligned GPUBufferDesriptor size should fail.
PASS Any method call on an invalid GPUBuffer should fail.
PASS Any method call on a destroyed GPUBuffer should fail.
