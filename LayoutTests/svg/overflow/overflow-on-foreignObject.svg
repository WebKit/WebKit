 Verify default overflow rules on foreignObject
 You should see a 300x300 green rectangle at 100x100 and no scrollbars.

 NOTE: This is currently BROKEN in WebKit. We're clipping the viewport of <foreignObject> correctly,
       though for each positioned object a RenderLayer is created, that has no knownledge of the
       size of the <foreignObject> viewport - as <foreignObject> doesn't create a RenderLayer.
       So for now, you'll see an unclipped content area, just as if overflow was visible.
