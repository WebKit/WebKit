<!-- 
 Verify default overflow rules for the outermost <svg> element in non-standalone documents.
 The green rectangle should cover the entire screen, since no clipping is done for overflow:visible.

 Spec reference:
 When an outermost 'svg' element is embedded inline within a parent XML grammar which uses CSS layout [CSS2-LAYOUT]
 or XSL formatting [XSL], if the 'overflow' property has the value hidden or scroll, then the user agent will establish
 an initial clipping path equal to the bounds of the initial viewport; otherwise, the initial clipping path is set
 according to the clipping rules as defined in [CSS2-overflow].
