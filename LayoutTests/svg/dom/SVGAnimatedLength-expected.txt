This test checks the SVGAnimatedLength API - utilizing the width property of SVGRectElement

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".



Check initial width value
PASS rectElement.width.toString() is "[object SVGAnimatedLength]"
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal.toString() is "[object SVGLength]"
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal.value is 0

Check that lengths are dynamic, caching value in a local variable and modifying it, should take effect
PASS numRef.value is 100
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal.value is 100

Check that assigning to baseVal has no effect, as no setter is defined
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal = -1 is -1
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal = 'aString' is "aString"
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal = rectElement is rectElement

Check that the width value remained 100, and the baseVal type has not been changed
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal.toString() is "[object SVGLength]"
PASS rectElement.width.baseVal.value is 100
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
