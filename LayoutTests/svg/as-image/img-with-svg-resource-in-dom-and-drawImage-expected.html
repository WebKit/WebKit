<p>This test shows a <code>&lt;canvas></code> element in which we draw the SVG image with the source rectangle set to fit the green rectangle from the SVG image and the destination rectangle as the bounds of the canvas element. In this example, the source <code>&lt;img></code> is in the DOM and is explicitly sized.</p>
<div style="background-color: green; width: 200px; height: 200px;"></div>
