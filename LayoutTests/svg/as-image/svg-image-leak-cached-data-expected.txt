This test checks if SVGImageCache leaks SVG image data as reported in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87792. Its layout has no particular meaning. The test will cause crash of debug version when leaks of SVG image data is detected.

Note: the code detects leaks of SVG image data on destruction of SVGImageCache, which doesn't work on platforms that DumpRenderTree leaks the cache itself.
