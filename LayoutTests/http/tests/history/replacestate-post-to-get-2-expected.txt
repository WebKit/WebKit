If the current entry in the session history represents a non-GET request (e.g. it was the result of a POST submission) then update it to instead represent a GET request (or equivalent).

This test checks that this works when navigation back and forward again.

This test passes if this page is eventually loaded with a GET request.

This page was loaded with a GET request.
