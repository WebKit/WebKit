http://localhost:8000/misc/authentication-redirect-1/resources/auth-then-redirect.py?redirect=301 - didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge - Responding with testUser:testPassword
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40138
You should load this page at 127.0.0.1:8000 so localhost:8000 is considered a different security origin.
This test loads a py script which demands http authentication, then uses it to redirect to another script in a different origin that shows what authentication headers were sent with the final request.
It does this once each for HTTP 301, 302, 303, and 307 redirects.
If not running under DRT, enter any credentials when asked.
