CONSOLE MESSAGE: ApplicationCache is deprecated. Please use ServiceWorkers instead.
CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to display 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/appcache/x-frame-options-prevents-framing.py' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'.
The following iframe is a document that was cached in the application cache.
It also had "x-frame-options: deny" set, so it should not actually show up in the iframe
