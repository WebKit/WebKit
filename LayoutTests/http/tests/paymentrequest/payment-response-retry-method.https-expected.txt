PASS PaymentResponse.prototype must have a retry() function (smoke test).
PASS A completed payment request cannot be retried.
PASS Calling retry() more than once yield a rejected promise, but the retryPromise resolves independently.

PASS Calling retry() multiple times is always a new object.
PASS When retrying without errors, the user is shown an `unknown` error.
PASS response.details should be updated after the user accepts a retry.
