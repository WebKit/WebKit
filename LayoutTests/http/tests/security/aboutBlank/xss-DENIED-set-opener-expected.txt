This page opens a window to "", injects malicious code, and then uses window.open.call to set its opener to the victim. The opened window then tries to scripts its opener.
Code injected into window:
<script>function write(target, message) { target.document.body.innerHTML = message; }
setTimeout(function() {write(window.opener.top.frames[0], 'FAIL: XSS was allowed.');}, 100);
setTimeout(function() {write(window.opener.top.frames[1], 'SUCCESS: Window remained in original SecurityOrigin.');}, 200);
setTimeout(function() { if (window.testRunner) testRunner.globalFlag = true; }, 300);</script>
