<p>This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure image via a redirect.  We should *not* trigger
a mixed content block even though the child frame has CSP directive block-all-mixed-content because the
redirected insecure image is upgraded to a secure image as the child frame has CSP directive upgrade-insecure-requests.</p>
