CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'none'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-H/s/dWGkGDaCkKqmo0VNeHrTgvJjinI5uvu7UmY6EB8='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution. Note also that 'style-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
