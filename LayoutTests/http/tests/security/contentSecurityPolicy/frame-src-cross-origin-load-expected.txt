IFrames blocked by CSP should generate a 'load' event, regardless of blocked state. This means they appear to be normal cross-origin loads, thereby not leaking URL information directly to JS.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS IFrame #1 generated a 'load' event.
PASS IFrame #2 generated a 'load' event.
PASS IFrame #3 generated a 'load' event.
