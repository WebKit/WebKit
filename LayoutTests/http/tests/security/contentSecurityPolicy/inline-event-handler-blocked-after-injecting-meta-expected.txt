CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 19: Clicking a link, post-policy:
CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 21: Refused to execute inline event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution. Note also that 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.

This test checks that CSP is evaluated on each call to an inline event handler, even if it's been executed pre-policy. It passes if one 'PASS' and no 'FAIL' messages appear.
