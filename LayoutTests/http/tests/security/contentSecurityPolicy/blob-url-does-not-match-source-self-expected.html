<!-- This is an reference HTML document as opposed to a plain text file so as to avoid the need the include the text of
the Content Security Policy console message when the blob-URL is blocked. The Content Security Policy console message
will differ between test runs because it contains the uniquely generated blob-URL that triggered the violation. -->
<p>This tests that a blob-URL JavaScript script fails to load because it does not match Content Security Policy <code>script-src 'self'</code>.</p>
