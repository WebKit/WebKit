<p>This test loads a secure iframe with the 'upgrade-insecure-requests' header.
The secure frame has an insecure script reference, which will get upgraded. The
secure frame does a secure load of another frame. This other frame specifies an
insecure load of this same script.

If the nested subresource logic is working properly, the non-secure load in
the second nested frame should be upgraded, even though that frame does not use
the 'upgrade-insecure-requests' header, because it had been previously upgraded
by an enclosing context.

The frame two-layers deep also loads a second script using HTTP. This should also
be upgraded to HTTPS, since the nested frame inherits the 'upgrade-insecure-request'
from its parent.</p>
