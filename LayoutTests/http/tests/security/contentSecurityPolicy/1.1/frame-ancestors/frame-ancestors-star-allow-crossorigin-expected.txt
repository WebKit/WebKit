A 'frame-ancestors' CSP directive with '*' should allow rendering. Note that we can't distinguish blocked URLs from allowed cross-origin URLs due to the same-origin policy. This test PASSED if no console message declares that the frame was blocked.



--------
Frame: '<!--frame1-->'
--------
This is an IFrame sending a Content Security Policy header containing "frame-ancestors *".
