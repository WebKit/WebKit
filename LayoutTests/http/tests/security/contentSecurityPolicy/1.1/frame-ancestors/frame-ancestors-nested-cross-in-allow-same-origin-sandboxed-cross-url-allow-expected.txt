A 'frame-ancestors' CSP directive with a URL value should compare against each frame's origin rather than URL, so a nested frame with a sandboxed parent frame with allow-same-origin should be allowed due to the parent opting out of the unique origin.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
