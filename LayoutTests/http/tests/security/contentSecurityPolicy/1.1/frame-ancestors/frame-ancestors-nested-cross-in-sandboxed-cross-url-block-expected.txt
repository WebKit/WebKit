CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load http://localhost:8080/security/contentSecurityPolicy/resources/frame-ancestors.pl?policy=http://127.0.0.1:8000%20http://localhost:8080 because it does not appear in the frame-ancestors directive of the Content Security Policy.
A 'frame-ancestors' CSP directive with a URL value should compare against each frame's origin rather than URL, so a nested frame with a sandboxed parent frame should be blocked due to the parent having a unique origin.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
