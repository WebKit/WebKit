<p>A 'frame-ancestors' CSP directive with a URL value should block or allow rendering in nested frames as appropriate. Note that we can't distinguish blocked URLs from allowed cross-origin URLs due to the same-origin policy. This test PASSED if no console message declares that the frame was blocked.</p>
