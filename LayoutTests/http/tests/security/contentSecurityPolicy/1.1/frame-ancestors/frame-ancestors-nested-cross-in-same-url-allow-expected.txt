A 'frame-ancestors' CSP directive with a URL value should block or allow rendering in nested frames as appropriate. Note that we can't distinguish blocked URLs from allowed cross-origin URLs due to the same-origin policy. This test PASSED if no console message declares that the frame was blocked.



--------
Frame: '<!--frame1-->'
--------
Testing a cross-origin child with a policy of "http://127.0.0.1:8000 http://localhost:8080" nested in a same-origin parent.



--------
Frame: '<!--frame2-->'
--------
This is an IFrame sending a Content Security Policy header containing "frame-ancestors http://127.0.0.1:8000 http://localhost:8080".
