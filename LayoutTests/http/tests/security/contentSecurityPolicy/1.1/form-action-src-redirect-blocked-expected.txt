CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load http://127.0.0.1:8000/navigation/resources/redirection-response.py?host=localhost:8000&status=302&target=form-target.pl because it does not appear in the form-action directive of the Content Security Policy.

Tests that blocking form redirect works correctly. If this test passes, you will see a console error, and will not see a page indicating a form was POSTed.
