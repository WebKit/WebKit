CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load data:application/x-webkit-test-netscape,logifloaded because its MIME type does not appear in the plugin-types directive of the Content Security Policy.
Given a `plugin-types` directive, plugins have to declare a type explicitly. No declared type, no load. This test passes if there's a console message above and "FAIL!" isn't logged.
