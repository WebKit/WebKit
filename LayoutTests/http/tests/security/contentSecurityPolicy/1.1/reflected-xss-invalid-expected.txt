CONSOLE MESSAGE: The 'reflected-xss' Content Security Policy directive has the invalid value "invalid". Value values are "allow", "filter", and "block".
CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 4: The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in 'http://localhost:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?csp=invalid&q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E ' because its source code was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server sent neither an 'X-XSS-Protection' nor 'Content-Security-Policy' header.
Tests that 'X-WebKit-CSP: reflected-xss invalid' enables the XSSAuditor. This test passes if a console message is generated, and the script is allowed.
