CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/contentSecurityPolicy/resources/alert-fail.html because it does not appear in the frame-src directive of the Content Security Policy.
This tests that an <iframe> load is blocked when using Content Security Policy frame-src 'none'; child-src 'self' because the deprecated directive frame-src takes precedence over the directive child-src. This test PASSED if there is no JavaScript alert.
