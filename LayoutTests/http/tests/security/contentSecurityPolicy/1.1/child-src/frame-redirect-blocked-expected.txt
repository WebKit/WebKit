CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load http://localhost:8000/security/contentSecurityPolicy/resources/alert-fail.html because it does not appear in the frame-src directive of the Content Security Policy.
This tests that the Content Security Policy of the page blocks an <iframe> from loading a document of a different origin through a redirect. This test PASSED if there is no JavaScript alert.
