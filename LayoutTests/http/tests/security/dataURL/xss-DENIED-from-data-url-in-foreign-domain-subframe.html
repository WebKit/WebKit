    <p>The scenario for this test is that you have an iframe with content from a foreign domain.  In that foreign content
        is an iframe which loads a data: URL.  This tests that the data: URL loaded iframe does not have access
        to the main frame using top.document.</p>
    <p id='accessMe'>Pass: Cross frame access from a data: URL on a different domain was denied.</p>
    <iframe id='aFrame' name="aFrame" src="http://localhost:8000/security/dataURL/resources/foreign-domain-data-url-accessor-iframe.html" style="width: 400px; height:200px;"></iframe>
