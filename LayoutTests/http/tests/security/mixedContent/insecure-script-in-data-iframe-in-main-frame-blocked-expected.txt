CONSOLE MESSAGE: [blocked] The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-data-url-frame-with-script.html was not allowed to run insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/script.js.

This test opens a window that loads a data: iframe that loads an insecure script, and that the script is still blocked. Although the data: frame has a separate origin, the script can still navigate top.
