CONSOLE MESSAGE: The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-script.html ran insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/script.js.

This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure script. We should trigger a mixed content callback even though the main frame is HTTP because the HTTPS frame's origin is contaminated with an insecure script.
