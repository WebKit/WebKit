CONSOLE MESSAGE: The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-form.html contains a form which targets an insecure URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/resources/doesnotexist.

This test opens a window that has a form with an non-https action. We should trigger a mixed content callback because the main frame in the window is HTTPS but is running insecure content.
