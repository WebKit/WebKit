CONSOLE MESSAGE: The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-cors-image.html requested insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/resources/compass.jpg%20crossorigin. This content was automatically upgraded and should be served over HTTPS.

This test opens a window that loads an insecure image. We should trigger a mixed content callback because the main frame in the window is HTTPS but is displaying insecure content.
