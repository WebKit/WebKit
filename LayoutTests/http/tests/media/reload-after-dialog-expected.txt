CONFIRM: I hope the movie continues to play!

Make sure we don't reload a <video> element after a dialog is shown.
Test this by loading a movie slowly and showing a dialog when a 'loadstart' event
handler is called. If the movie is reloaded when the dialog is "dismissed", another
'loadstart' event will be fired


'load' event
*** Setting up element...

'loadstart' event
*** Showing confirm dialog...

'canplaythrough' event

END OF TEST
