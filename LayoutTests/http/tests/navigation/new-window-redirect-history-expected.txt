This test will open a new window to an empty url and fill its contents with a document.write()
That document will then redirect to another url called redirect-1.html.
That document will redirect to yet another url called redirect-2.html
The back/forward history of the new window should contain both redirect-1.html and redirect-2.html

The test will run automatically with popup blocking disabled, or you can click the button.
