This tests whether referrer information gets properly set and reset when "noreferrer" links are present. We do the following:
1. Open a link in a new window: referrer is sent and window.opener is sent.
2. Click a rel="noreferrer" link: referrer and window.opener are nulled.
3. Click a link without rel="noreferrer": referrer is sent, but window.opener is still null (since it was nulled in the previous step).
