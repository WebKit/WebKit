Tests the following sequence of events:

Submit a form via POST to a frame (redirect-to-go-back.pl).
Form page does a 302 to a static page (top-go-back.html), still within the frame.
Static page does a top-level navigation to another static page (go-back.html)
This static page goes back.
We should end up showing the top-level page with the first static page inside the frame.




--------
Frame: 'target-frame'
