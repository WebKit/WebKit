# Simple script to generate a POST result.
#
# Depending on which button was pushed in the form, we either generate a direct
# result page, or we use the pattern where the post returns a 303 redirect,
# and then the resulting GET yields the true POST result.  Sites do this trick
# to avoid having POSTS in the b/f list, so you don't run into POSTs getting
# resubmitted by accident.
