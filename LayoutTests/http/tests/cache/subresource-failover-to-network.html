    // The results of the form submission is a page that performs a non-
    // cacheable sync XHR request.  Upon returning to that page, we expect the
    // sync XHR request to still succeed.  This relies on it loading from the
    // network and not being restricted to loading from the cache (as the main
    // page is).

<p>
This test verifies that a synchronous XMLHttpRequest, generated from a page
that is the result of a form submission, loads properly when the user navigates
back to the page.
<p>
When navigating back to a page that resulted from a form submission, the page
is loaded with the ReturnCacheDataDontLoad cache policy.  It is important that
subresources (including XMLHttpRequest instances) do not inherit this cache
policy.
