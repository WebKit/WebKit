This test checks that loading a subresource with "Cache-Control: no-store" is cached and reused in back navigation when the page is not in the page cache.

We then test that loading the same subresource is refetched when used in non-stale loads such as refreshes or normal navigation.

PASS - no-store subresource was cached and used for a back navigation
PASS - no-store subresource was refetched with a reload
PASS - no-store subresource was refetched with a normal navigation
