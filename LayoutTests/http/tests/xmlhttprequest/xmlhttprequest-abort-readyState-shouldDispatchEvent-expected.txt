Test bug 13141 : XMLHttpRequest should set readyState to 0 after abort()

Updated for bug 16989: Add send() flag checks in XmlHttpRequest

Should see "PASS (reasyState event send)" & "PASS" (in that order) three times:

PASS (readystate event send)
PASS
PASS (readystate event send)
PASS
PASS (readystate event send)
PASS
