frame "<!--frame1-->" - has 1 onunload handler(s)
Test for bug 11450 REGRESSION: XMLHttpRequest::didFinishLoading() should immediately return if the request has already been aborted

If a frame has an active XMLHttpRequest that is still receiving data, and that frame is destroyed
(or its load is otherwise stopped) the XMLHttpRequest gets an abort call then a didFinishedLoading call.

That didFinishedLoading() call should immediately exit and not update the object's state or do any other notifications.
