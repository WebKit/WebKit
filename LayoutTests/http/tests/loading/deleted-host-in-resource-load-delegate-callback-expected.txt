This test is for rdar://problem/6727495.
It loads a page with some image resources, then reloads itself. When the page is reloaded, the image resources are revalidated and then some javascript is run as a result.
In Safari, that javascript opened a modal dialog which spun up an inner run loop which caused a Loader::Host that was currently in the middle of a resource load delegate callback to be deleted.
If you do not crash, you pass.
