Test worker file does not exist error. Should print two "PASS" statements followed by "DONE".

The order of the error events should be onerror and then error event, and this test should be improved to verify that when bug https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62485 is fixed.

PASS: error event.
PASS: onerror called.
DONE
