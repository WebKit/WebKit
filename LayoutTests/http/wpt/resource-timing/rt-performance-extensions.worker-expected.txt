PASS Must have PerformanceObserver and PerformanceResourceTiming in DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope
PASS performance.clearResourceTimings clears the buffer
PASS performance.clearResourceTimings called multiple times is okay
PASS resourcetimingbufferfull event should not trigger for a small number of resources (browser default buffer size)
PASS PerformanceObserver sees all resource entries even after buffer is full
PASS resourcetimingbufferfull event should not trigger if less than the BufferSizeLimit number of resources are added to the buffer
PASS resourcetimingbufferfull event should not trigger if exactly the BufferSizeLimit number of resources are added to the buffer
PASS resourcetimingbufferfull event should only trigger once if more than the BufferSizeLimit number of resources are added to the buffer
PASS resourcetimingbufferfull event properties
PASS performance.setResourceTimingBufferSize set to value less than current BufferSize should not clear existing entries
