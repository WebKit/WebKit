This test tries to test whether the JWK format exporting/importing methods work as expected.To do so, it first generates an EC Key Pair, then exports them into JWKs, then imports them back, and finally uses them to do signature verification.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
