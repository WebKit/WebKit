Test sending hashed rsa crypto keys via postMessage to a worker.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS All checks passed in worker for public key
PASS publicKey.type is 'public'
PASS publicKey.extractable is true
PASS publicKey.algorithm.name is 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5'
PASS publicKey.algorithm.modulusLength is 2048
PASS bytesToHexString(publicKey.algorithm.publicExponent) is '010001'
PASS publicKey.algorithm.hash.name is 'SHA-256'
PASS publicKey.usages is ['verify']
PASS All checks passed in worker for private key
PASS privateKey.type is 'private'
PASS privateKey.extractable is false
PASS privateKey.algorithm.name is 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5'
PASS privateKey.algorithm.modulusLength is 2048
PASS bytesToHexString(privateKey.algorithm.publicExponent) is '010001'
PASS privateKey.algorithm.hash.name is 'SHA-256'
PASS privateKey.usages is ['sign']
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
