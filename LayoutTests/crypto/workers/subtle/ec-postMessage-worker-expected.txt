PASS publicKey.type is 'public'
PASS publicKey.extractable is true
PASS publicKey.algorithm.name is 'ECDH'
PASS publicKey.algorithm.namedCurve is 'P-256'
PASS publicKey.usages is [ ]
PASS exportedKey.x is publicKeyJSON.x
PASS exportedKey.y is publicKeyJSON.y
PASS All checks passed in worker for private key
PASS privateKey.type is 'private'
PASS privateKey.extractable is true
PASS privateKey.algorithm.name is 'ECDH'
PASS privateKey.algorithm.namedCurve is 'P-256'
PASS privateKey.usages is ['deriveBits']
PASS exportedKey.x is privateKeyJSON.x
PASS exportedKey.y is privateKeyJSON.y
PASS exportedKey.d is privateKeyJSON.d
PASS successfullyParsed is true
