PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' should prevent acceleration
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on a keyframe should prevent acceleration
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation further up the stack should prevent lower animations in the stack from being accelerated
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should allow replace animations further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should prevent replace animations with an implicity keyframe further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack targeting a property that isn't accelerated should allow replace animations with implicit keyframes further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' on an effect should toggle acceleration
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' on a keyframe should toggle acceleration
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation further up the stack should toggle acceleration on lower animations in the stack
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should toggle acceleration but always allow replace animations further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should toggle acceleration on replace animations with an implicity keyframe further up the stack
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack targeting a property that isn't accelerated shouldn't prevent acceleration of animations with implicit keyframes further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Adding a composing effect on top of an existing replace effect should prevent both effects from running accelerated
