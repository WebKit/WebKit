This test exercises the source URL and line number that is embedded in JavaScript exceptions, which is displayed in places like the JavaScript console. It differs from exception-linenums-in-html-1.html in that it only works if Bugzilla Bug 3905 has been fixed.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
