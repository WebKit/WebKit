Test ensures Reflect.set functionality with DOM objects.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


CustomAccessor setters for DOM objects. These setters are treated as setters in ECMA262. Reflect.set returns true because a setter is found.
PASS Reflect.set(document.body, "scrollTop", "#Hello") is true
PASS Reflect.get(document.body, "scrollTop") is not "#Hello"
PASS Reflect.set(document.body, "scrollTop", 0) is true
PASS Reflect.get(document.body, "scrollTop") is 0
PASS Reflect.set(document.body, "scrollTop", "Cocoa", receiver) threw exception TypeError: The Element.scrollTop setter can only be used on instances of Element.
PASS Reflect.get(document.body, "scrollTop") is 0
PASS Reflect.get(receiver, "scrollTop") is undefined

PASS Reflect.get(receiver, 0) is "OK"
PASS Reflect.defineProperty(npobject, 0, {
    writable: false
}) is true
PASS Reflect.set(npobject, 0, "Hello") is false
PASS Reflect.get(npobject, 0) is "Sweet"
PASS Reflect.set(npobject, 0, "OK", receiver) is false
PASS Reflect.get(npobject, 0) is "Sweet"
PASS Reflect.get(receiver, 0) is undefined
DOMStringMap
PASS Reflect.get(document.body.dataset, "cocoa") is "cappuccino"
PASS Reflect.set(document.body.dataset, "cocoa", "sweet") is true
PASS Reflect.get(document.body.dataset, "cocoa") is "sweet"
PASS Reflect.set(document.body.dataset, "cocoa-cappuccino", "sweet") threw exception SyntaxError: The string did not match the expected pattern..
PASS Reflect.set(document.body.dataset, 0, "sweet") is true
PASS Reflect.get(document.body.dataset, 0) is "sweet"
DOMStringMap ignores the receiver. These putDelegate only work with ::put (not ::defineOwnProperty). So they behave as the special setter, we should not fallback to the OrdinarySet.
PASS Reflect.set(document.body.dataset, "cocoa", "ok", receiver) is true
PASS Reflect.get(document.body.dataset, "cocoa") is "ok"
PASS Reflect.get(receiver, "cocoa") is undefined
PASS Reflect.set(document.body.dataset, 0, "ok", receiver) is true
PASS Reflect.get(document.body.dataset, 0) is "ok"
PASS Reflect.get(receiver, 0) is undefined
CustomIndexedSetter
PASS Reflect.get(select, 0).value is "cocoa"
PASS Reflect.get(select, "length") is 3
PASS Reflect.set(select, 0, option) is true
PASS Reflect.get(select, 0).value is "mocha"
PASS Reflect.get(select, "length") is 3
PASS Reflect.set(select, 42, option) is true
PASS Reflect.get(select, "length") is 42
PASS Reflect.set(select, 44, option2) is true
PASS Reflect.get(select, 44).value is "kilimanjaro"
PASS Reflect.set(select, 20, "Kilimanjaro") threw exception TypeError: Type error.
CustomIndexedSetter ignores the receiver. These methods only work with ::put (not ::defineOwnProperty). So they behave as the special setter, we should not fallback to the OrdinarySet.
PASS Reflect.set(select, 0, option3, receiver) is true
PASS Reflect.get(receiver, 0) is undefined
PASS Reflect.get(select, 0) is option3
PASS successfullyParsed is true
