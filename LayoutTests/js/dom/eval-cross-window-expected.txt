This page verifies that eval, when called as a function, uses the "this" object provided by the call as its variable object, scope chain, and "this" object. However, if the "this" object is not the global object eval was originally associated with, eval throws an exception.

If the test passes, you'll see a series of pass messages below.


----- Scope Chain Head for Getters: -----

PASS: window.eval("x") should be 0 and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("x") should be 1 and is.
PASS: window.eval("x") should be 1 and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("x") should be undefined and is.

----- Scope Chain for Getters: -----

PASS: window.eval("xx") should be ReferenceError and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("xx") should be ReferenceError and is.
PASS: window.eval("xx") should be ReferenceError and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("xx") should be ReferenceError and is.

----- Variable Object: -----

PASS: window.eval("var y; "y" in top") should be true and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("var y; "y" in top.frames[0]") should be true and is.
PASS: window.eval("var y; "y" in top.frames[0]") should be undefined and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("var y; "y" in top") should be undefined and is.

----- Scope Chain for Setters: -----

PASS: window.eval("z = 1; top.z") should be 1 and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("z = 2; top.frames[0].z") should be 2 and is.
PASS: window.eval("z = 3; top.frames[0].z") should be undefined and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("z = 4; top.z") should be undefined and is.

----- This Object: -----

PASS: window.eval("this") should be [object Window] and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("this") should be [object Window] and is.
PASS: window.eval("this") should be undefined and is.
PASS: frames[0].eval("this") should be undefined and is.
