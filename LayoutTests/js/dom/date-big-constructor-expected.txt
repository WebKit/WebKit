This test case checks that months greater than 11 are handled correctly when passed to the Date constructor and the Date.UTC function. The ECMA 262 specification says that months > 11 should be treated as month % 12 and the year as year + floor(month / 12).

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
