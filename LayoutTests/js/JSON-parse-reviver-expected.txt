Test behaviour of JSON reviver function.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".



Ensure the holder for our array is indeed an array
PASS Array.isArray(currentHolder) is true
PASS currentHolder.length is 5

Ensure that the holder already has all the properties present at the start of filtering

PASS currentHolder[4] is "extra value"

Ensure the holder for our array is indeed an array
PASS Array.isArray(currentHolder) is true
PASS currentHolder.length is 5

Ensure that we always get the same holder
PASS currentHolder is lastHolder

Ensure that returning undefined has removed the property 0 from the holder during filtering.
PASS currentHolder.hasOwnProperty(0) is false

Ensure the holder for our array is indeed an array
PASS Array.isArray(currentHolder) is true
PASS currentHolder.length is 5

Ensure that we always get the same holder
PASS currentHolder is lastHolder

Ensure that changing the value of a property is reflected while filtering.
PASS currentHolder[2] is "a replaced value"

Ensure that the changed value is reflected in the arguments passed to the reviver
PASS value is currentHolder[2]

Ensure the holder for our array is indeed an array
PASS Array.isArray(currentHolder) is true

PASS currentHolder.hasOwnProperty(3) is false

Ensure that when visiting a deleted property value is undefined
PASS value is undefined.

Ensure that we created the root holder as specified in ES5
PASS '' in lastHolder is true
PASS result is lastHolder['']

Ensure that a deleted value is revived if the reviver function returns a value
PASS result.hasOwnProperty(3) is true

Test behaviour of revivor used in conjunction with an object
PASS currentHolder != globalObject is true

Ensure that the holder already has all the properties present at the start of filtering
PASS currentHolder['a property'] is "a value"
PASS currentHolder['another property'] is "another value"
PASS currentHolder['and another property'] is "and another value"
PASS currentHolder['to delete'] is "will be deleted"
PASS currentHolder != globalObject is true

Ensure that we get the same holder object for each property
PASS currentHolder is lastHolder

Ensure that returning undefined has correctly removed the property 'a property' from the holder object
PASS currentHolder.hasOwnProperty('a property') is false
PASS currentHolder != globalObject is true

Ensure that we get the same holder object for each property
PASS currentHolder is lastHolder

PASS value is undefined.

Ensure that we created the root holder as specified in ES5
PASS lastHolder.hasOwnProperty('') is true
PASS result.hasOwnProperty('a property') is false
PASS result.hasOwnProperty('to delete') is true
PASS result is lastHolder['']

Test behaviour of revivor that introduces a cycle
PASS JSON.parse("[0,1]", reviveAddsCycle) threw exception RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded..

Test behaviour of revivor that introduces a new array classed object (the result of a regex)
PASS JSON.stringify(JSON.parse("[0,1]", reviveIntroducesNewArrayLikeObject)) is '[0,["a","a"]]'
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
