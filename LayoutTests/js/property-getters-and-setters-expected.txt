This performs a number of different tests on JavaScript getters and setters.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


the get set object declaration syntax
PASS o1.b is 8
PASS o1.b is 11
__defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__
PASS o2.b is 8
PASS o2.b is 11
Setting a value without having a setter
PASS o3.x = 10; o3.x is 42
Getting a value without having a getter
PASS o4.x is undefined.
__lookupGetter__ and __lookupSetter__
PASS o4.__lookupGetter__('b') is getB
PASS o4.__lookupSetter__('b') is setB
__defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ with various invalid arguments
PASS o5.__defineSetter__('a', null) threw exception TypeError: invalid setter usage.
PASS o5.__defineSetter__('a', o5) threw exception TypeError: invalid setter usage.
PASS o5.__defineGetter__('a', null) threw exception TypeError: invalid getter usage.
PASS o5.__defineGetter__('a', o5) threw exception TypeError: invalid getter usage.
setters and getters with exceptions
PASS x = o6.x threw exception Exception in get.
PASS x is 0
PASS o6.x = 42 threw exception Exception in set.
Defining a setter should also define a getter for the same property which returns undefined. Thus, a getter defined on the prototype should not be called.
PASS o7.x is undefined.
If an object has a property and its prototype has a setter function for that property, then setting the property should set the property directly and not call the setter function.
PASS o8.numSets is 0
PASS typeof testObj.getter is 'string'
the get set with string property name
PASS o9.b is 8
PASS o9.b is 11
the get set with numeric property name
PASS o10[42] is 8
PASS o10[42] is 11
Defining getter only and accessing __lookupSetter__ should not crash
PASS o11.__lookupSetter__('b') is void 0
Defining setter only and accessing __lookupGetter__ should not crash
PASS o12.__lookupGetter__('b') is void 0
When undefined, accessing __lookupGetter__ and __lookupSetter__ should not crash
PASS o13.__lookupGetter__('b') is void 0
PASS o13.__lookupSetter__('b') is void 0
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
