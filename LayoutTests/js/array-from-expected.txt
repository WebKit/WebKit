PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3]).length is 3
PASS Array.from('abc') is ['a', 'b', 'c']
PASS Array.from('abc').length is 3
PASS Array.from(Array.from([4, 5, 6])) is [4, 5, 6]
PASS Array.from([null, null]) is [null, null]
PASS Array.from([]).length is 0

Incorrect construction
-------
PASS Array.from() threw exception TypeError: Array.from requires an array-like object - not null or undefined.
PASS Array.from(null) threw exception TypeError: Array.from requires an array-like object - not null or undefined.
PASS Array.from(undefined) threw exception TypeError: Array.from requires an array-like object - not null or undefined.
Declare wayTooSmall = { length: -1 }
PASS Array.from(wayTooSmall) is []
Declare wayTooBig = { length: Infinity }
PASS Array.from(wayTooBig) threw exception RangeError: Array size is not a small enough positive integer..

Mapped construction
-------
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], function (x) { return x * 10; }) is [10, 20, 30]
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], function (x) { return null; }) is [null, null, null]
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], function (x) { }).length is 3
PASS Array.from({length: 5}, function(v, k) { return k; }) is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Declare var bacon = { eggs: 5 }
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], function (x) { return x * this.eggs; }, bacon) is [5, 10, 15]

Incorrect mapped construction
-------
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], null) threw exception TypeError: Array.from requires that the second argument, when provided, be a function.
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], []) threw exception TypeError: Array.from requires that the second argument, when provided, be a function.
PASS Array.from([1, 2, 3], [1]) threw exception TypeError: Array.from requires that the second argument, when provided, be a function.

Weird construction

PASS Array.from(Math).length is 0
Declare wayTooWrong = { length: NaN }
PASS Array.from(wayTooWrong) is []

Array with holes
-------
PASS Array.from(arrayWithHoles) is [,,, true,,,, , , 'hi']

Modify length during construction
-------
PASS Array.from(crazyPants) is ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']

Modify length during mapping
-------
PASS Array.from(crazyPants, function (x) { crazyPants.length = x; return x; }) is ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']

Construction using Set object
-------
