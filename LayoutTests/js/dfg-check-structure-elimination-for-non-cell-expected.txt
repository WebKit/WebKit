Tests that we do the right things when we prove that we can eliminate a structure check, but haven't proved that the value is definitely an object - i.e. we've proved that it's either an object with a specific structure, or it's not an object at all.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Caught exception: TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'o.g')
Passed some tests silently.
