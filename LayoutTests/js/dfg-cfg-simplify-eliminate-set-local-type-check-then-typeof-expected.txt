Tests what happens when CFG simplification leads to the elimination of a set local that had a type check, and then we do a typeof on the value, which can be constant folded if the type check stays.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Passed some tests silently.
