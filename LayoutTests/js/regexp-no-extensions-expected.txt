Tests that regular expressions do not have extensions that diverge from the JavaScript specification. Because WebKit originally used a copy of PCRE, various non-JavaScript regular expression features were historically present. Also tests various related edge cases.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
