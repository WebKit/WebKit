Put mouse here and do the following:
Perform two text zooms (in). (Command+ in Safari)
Scroll down to the bottom. Be sure to scroll far enough that a rubberband animation is triggered.
Perform two text zooms (out). (Commmand- in Safari)
Tests that scroll dimensions return to correct size after rubber banding while zoomed.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
