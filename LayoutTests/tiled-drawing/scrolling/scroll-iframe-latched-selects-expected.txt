Tests that latched state logic does not get stuck scrolling a specific <select>. To manually run this test, place the mouse pointer
within one left <select> boundary, and then use the mouse wheel or a two-finger to scroll down the list, without momentum scrolling.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS Leftmost <select> was not scrolled by the latch state logic
