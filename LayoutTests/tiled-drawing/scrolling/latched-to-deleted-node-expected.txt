Container

After moving 40px up or down we remove the initial target element of wheel event from
the dom. In safari this causes the wheel event to stop firing on the current frame, but it
then starts firing on the parent frame.

Tests that iframe doesn't consume wheel events when scrolling a select in an iframe.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
