CONSOLE MESSAGE: *** Test 'auto' value resolution for the shadow DOM 'slotted' elements. ***
Test to verify auto value resolution works as expected in root elements (eg. document root / shadow roots / slotted elements / elements inside slot)


PASS Check out how the DOM's root element resolves the align-self 'auto' values.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element align-items's value is used to resolve its children's align-self 'auto' values.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element deals with 'auto' value in align-items.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element resolves the justify-self 'auto' values.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element justify-items's value is used to resolve its children's justify-self 'auto' values.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element deals with 'auto' value in justify-items.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element justify-items's value with 'legacy' keyword is used to resolve any descendant's justify-items 'auto' values.
PASS Check out how the DOM's root element recomputes its descendant's style when 'legacy' keyword is removed from its justify-items value.
PASS Shadow Node inherits from ShadowHost to resolve the 'auto' values for align-self.
PASS Shadow Node inherits from ShadowHost to resolve the 'auto' values for justify-self.
PASS Check out how the 'legacy' keyword in justify-items propagates from the DOM Tree to the Shadow Node.
FAIL Check out how align-self uses the 'shadowHost' as 'slotted' element's parent while 'slot' is not assigned. assert_equals: alignItems is not what is should. expected "normal" but got "end"
FAIL Check out how justify-self uses the 'shadowHost' as 'slotted' element's parent while 'slot' is not assigned. assert_equals: justifyItems is not what is should. expected "left" but got "normal"
PASS Check out how the 'legacy' keyword in justify-items affects the 'slotted' elements while 'slot' is not assigned.
PASS Check out how align-self uses the 'slot' element's parent (Shadow Node) as 'slotted' element' s parent after the 'slot' is assigned.
PASS Check out how justify-self uses the 'slot' element's parent (Shadow Node) as 'slotted' element' s parent after the 'slot' is assigned.
PASS Check out how the 'legacy' keyword affects the 'slotted' elements after the 'slot' is assigned.
PASS The 'slot' element should not use its parent inside the ShadowDOM tree to resolve the align-self 'auto' values because Blink does not support slots in the flat tree.
PASS The 'slot' element should not use its parent inside the ShadowDOM tree to resolve the justify-self 'auto' values because Blink does not support slots in the flat tree.
