This test checks whether various seal/freeze/preventExtentions work on a regular object.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS (new inextensible).prototypeExists is true
PASS (new sealed).prototypeExists is true
PASS (new frozen).prototypeExists is true
PASS test(obj()) is "(b:4)(c:3)E"
PASS test(preventExtensions(obj())) is "(b:4)"
PASS test(seal(obj())) is "(a:1)(b:4)S"
PASS test(freeze(obj())) is "(a:1)(b:2)SF"
PASS Object.preventExtensions(Math.sin) is Math.sin
PASS var o = {}; Object.preventExtensions(o); o.__proto__ = { newProp: "Should not see this" }; o.newProp; is undefined.
PASS "use strict"; var o = {}; Object.preventExtensions(o); o.__proto__ = { newProp: "Should not see this" }; threw exception TypeError: Attempted to assign to readonly property..
PASS Object.preventExtensions(Math); Math.sqrt(4) is 2
PASS successfullyParsed is true
