<h2>Bug 1</h2>

<p>Safari public beta does not support CSS absolute positioning
correctly (if at all). Immediately following the text position marked
by the dagger, there is a &lt;span&gt element that is positioned to
the right of the &lt;div&gt; block that contains this
paragraph&dagger;<span class="margin">&larr; this should be to the
right of the paragraph, lining up with the dagger</span>. In IE 5.x,
Mozilla 1.2, and Chimera 0.6+, the contents of the &lt;span&gt;
element appears in the margin directly to the right of the dagger.</p>

<p>I should note that Chimera 0.6 rendered this test with the
marginal note shifted down by one line; this has been fixed in
subsequent builds.</p>

<h2>Bug 2</h2>
<p style="font-size: 10pt">Fonts also render substantially smaller
than other browsers, which is not a good thing when you consider that
most sites specify fonts that are too small in the first place.</p>

<p>At the very least, the preferences panel needs a default
text-zoom setting to enable compatibility with other browsers.</p>

<h2>Bug 3</h2>
<p>Worse, <i>the "make text bigger" button does not scale line-height
when it scales font-size</i> (hit it a few times on this page). This
is a crippling flaw for people who need to enlarge the fonts to read
comfortably.</p>
