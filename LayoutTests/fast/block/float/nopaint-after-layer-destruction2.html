        <h3>Stanley Park Forest</h3>
<p>The
forest is primarily second and third growth. The area was saved from
development because of its status as a federal military reserve; it
occupied a strategic location for defending the former provincial
capital of New Westminster in the case of an American naval invasion.
Nevertheless, the federal government allowed logging operations there
in the mid-nineteenth century. Large swathes of the park were also
deforested by natural causes on two occasions in the 20th century.</p>
