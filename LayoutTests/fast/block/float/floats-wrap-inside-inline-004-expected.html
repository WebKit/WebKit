<!--The span should avoid a float even when its top and bottom does not overlap with the top of the span.
    In this test the float overlaps inside the span and the span has height set by its style.-->
<p>There should be two black boxes below.</p>
<div style="position: absolute; width: 40px; height: 40px; background: black;"></div>
<div style="position: absolute; left: 58px; width: 40px; height: 20px; background: black;"></div>
