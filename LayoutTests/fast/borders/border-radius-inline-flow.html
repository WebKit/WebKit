<body style="line-height:3">
<span style="border:5px solid black; -webkit-border-radius:10px; padding:2px">
This is a span that crosses multiple lines and has a border-radius.  The border-radius should only apply at the endpoints of the span,
and the edges that are "open" should just be solid right up to the edge (with no rounding or clipping).
</span>
