This test records the order by which load and DOMContentLoaded evnets fire relative to when document.fonts.ready is resolved.
fonts.ready should resolve only after DOMContentLoaded and load event are fired, and fonts.check should return true for Ahem at that point.

Before setting font-family - fonts.check Ahem: false
DOMContentLoaded
load
fonts.ready - fonts.check Ahem: true
hello
