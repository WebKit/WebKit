Test for WebKit bug 27554: getComputedStyle does not contain a value for text-overflow


This text should overflow the box but should show ellipsis when the text is cut off at the edge of the box because it doesn't fit in the box as is.

This text should also overflow the box but should be clipped so that you don't see any ellipsis and the text just seems to end at an awkward place because it doesn't fit in the box.

This text should also overflow and be clipped because text-overflow should have the default behavior of clipping when no text-overflow is specified.

SUCCESS Expected text-overflow: ellipsis for div with text-overflow set to ellipsis and got it.

SUCCESS Expected text-overflow: clip for div with text-overflow set to clip and got it.

SUCCESS Expected text-overflow: clip for div with no text-overflow set and got it.
