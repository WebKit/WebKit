Test for bug 76701: map HTTP-EQUIV content-language to -webkit-locale. This particular test tests that a content-language is used even if it appears at the end of the document. This expectation may change, see bug. According to the HTML 5 spec, a meta element should be processed when it is inserted into the document, regardless of where. IE and Firefox also seem to process the content-language at the end of the document.

FAIL languageOfNode('x') should be ja-JP. Was auto.
PASS languageOfNode('y') is "ar"
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
