This test suite was converted from http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/parsing/encoding/all.html

The suite has been broken up to run the tests in smaller batches.

Expected failures:
56, 57, 58, 59 - we do not run scripts during encoding detection phase and parser treats meta inside a script as text, not a tag.
60 - parser treats meta inside style as text, not a tag.
97, 99, 102 - we do not run scripts during encoding detection.
Status: Tests ran.

Serious failures:

(Tests are considered to pass even if they treat Win1254 and ISO-8859-4 as separate.)
