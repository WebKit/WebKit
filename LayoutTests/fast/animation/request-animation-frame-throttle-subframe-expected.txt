Tests that requestAnimationFrame is throttled in subframes that are outside the viewport

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Frame is initially outside the viewport so requestAnimationFrame should be throttled
PASS testFrame.contentWindow.internals.requestAnimationFrameThrottlingReasons() became "OutsideViewport"
PASS internals.requestAnimationFrameThrottlingReasons() is "[Unthrottled]"
PASS testFrame.contentWindow.internals.requestAnimationFrameThrottlingReasons() is "OutsideViewport"
PASS grandChildFrame.contentWindow.internals.requestAnimationFrameThrottlingReasons() is "OutsideViewport"
Scrolling frame into view.
RequestAnimationFrame should no longer be throttled

PASS testFrame.contentWindow.internals.requestAnimationFrameThrottlingReasons() is "[Unthrottled]"
Scrolling frame out of view again.
PASS internals.requestAnimationFrameThrottlingReasons() is "[Unthrottled]"
