CRASH: Omitting terminal question mark in <?xml...?> declaration (above) causes access violation.

This tests the both the HTML parser (.html extension), which is where the crash was observed, and the XML parser (in an iframe).
See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17814

If you don't crash, you pass. A parsing error in the "xml-parser" subframe is expected.
