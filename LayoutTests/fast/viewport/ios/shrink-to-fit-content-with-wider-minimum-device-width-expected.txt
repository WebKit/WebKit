This test verifies that a page with a large client-set minimum effective device width, no viewport, and content larger than the actual view width is scaled to fit the client-set minimum effective device width. To test manually, load the page and verify that the bar spans half the width of the page.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
