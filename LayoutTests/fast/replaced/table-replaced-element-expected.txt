Layout test for WebKit bug 85581.

This tests that the contents of a table do not overflow when the table contains an image with percentage height. For this test to pass, the blue rectangle should be entirely within the table border and/or you should see a 'PASS' message below.

Height of table: 306
Height of table contents: 280
PASS: Table contents do not overflow outside of table border.
