<td rowspan=48651511>This test succeeds if it does not crash. We implemented a heuristic a while back to prevent giant rowspans. 
The heuristic did not, however, fix this case. This rowpsan was small enough so that we thought it was okay to allocate, but 
large enough so that it actually wasn't okay, and we crashed. Firefox seems to hold 8k as the maximum size for rowspans. 
So this change matches Firefox and clamps all rowspans to 8k right in the DOM.
