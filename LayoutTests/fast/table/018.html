<body>

This is a test for bug 3166276. Set the following preferences to see it:

<ul>
<li>Proportional font -- Times 15 point</li>
<li>Fixed width font -- Monaco 11 point</li>
</ul>

<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td>
The following text: <tt>hello world</tt>, is written using the &lt;tt&gt; tag. It should show up as Monaco 11 point, but instead it is showing up as Monaco 15 point. The font is correct, but the point size is whatever is set for the proportional font. Note that this only happens to text inside a &lt;table&gt;
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here is the same text again outside a &lt;table&gt;: <tt>hello world</tt>. Notice it is displayed correctly now.
