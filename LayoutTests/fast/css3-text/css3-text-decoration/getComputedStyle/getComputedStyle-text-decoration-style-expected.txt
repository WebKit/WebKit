PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is ""
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "solid"

Parent should cointain 'dashed':
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "dashed"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "dashed"

JavaScript setter tests for valid, initial, invalid and blank values:
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is ""

Valid value 'solid':
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "solid"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "solid"

Valid value 'double':
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "double"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "double"

Valid value 'dotted':
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "dotted"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "dotted"

Valid value 'dashed':
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "dashed"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "dashed"

Valid value 'wavy':
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "wavy"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "wavy"

Initial value:
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "initial"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "solid"

Invalid value (this property accepts one value at a time only):
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "initial"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "solid"

Invalid value (ie. 'unknown'):
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is "initial"
PASS computedStyle.textDecorationStyle is "solid"

Empty value (resets the property):
PASS e.style.textDecorationStyle is ""
