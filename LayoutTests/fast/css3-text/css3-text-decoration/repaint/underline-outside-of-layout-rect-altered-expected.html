This test makes sure that underlines contribute to visual overflow properly.
The SVG font has a descent of 0, which means that underlines will
lie outside of the glyph boundaries. The test makes sure of two things:
<ol>
<li>(Left box) That moving a decoration that contributes to overflow from
the top of a line to the bottom is redrawn as if it was always on the bottom
side</li>
<li>(Right box) That moving a decoration that contributes to overflow to a position where
it does not contribute to overflow anymore redraws as if it had never
contributed to overflow</li>
</ol>
