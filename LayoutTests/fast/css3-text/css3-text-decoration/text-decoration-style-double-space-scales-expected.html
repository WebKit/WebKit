This test renders large text with a double underline, but then barely clips off the bottom underline
using overflow: hidden. It makes sure that this is exactly the same as a single underline. If the
space between the two underlines does not scale with font size, it will appear as though there is a
single thick underline (because they will be drawn on top of each other) and will thus fail this test.
