This test makes sure that math is being performed before rounding occurs.
In the following run, the "aa" has a fractional x-coordinate value of
between .3 and .5. In addition that run's width also has this property.
If you round the x-coordinate and width before you add them together to
get the coordinate of the right-side of the run, you would see that the
run is a pixel shorter than it should be.
