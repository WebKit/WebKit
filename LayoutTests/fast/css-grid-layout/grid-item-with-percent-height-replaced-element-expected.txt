This test checks that percentage heights are properly resolved for grid items that are replaced elements. You shouldn't see any red if the test is working as expected.

1) 100% height on the image (grid item) should be resolved against the height of the grid area (200px). Actually we don't need the 100% height in this case as the grid items are stretched by default.


2) 100% height on the image (grid item's child) should be resolved against the height of the grid item, which is stretched by default to the height of the grid area (200px).


3) 100% height on the image (grid item) should be resolved against the height of the grid area (200px). The grid item is not stretched in this case but the height percentage can be resolved anyway.


4) 100% height on the image (grid item's child) should be resolved against the height of the grid item, as it's not stretched the grid item's height is indefinite, so the percentage cannot be resolved.


5) 100% height on the image (grid item's child) should be resolved against the height of the grid item, which also has a 100% height that is resolved against the height of the grid area (200px).
