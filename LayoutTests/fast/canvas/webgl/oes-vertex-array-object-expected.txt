This test verifies the functionality of the OES_vertex_array_object extension, if it is available.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS WebGL context exists
Testing binding enum with extension disabled
PASS getError was expected value: INVALID_ENUM : VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES should not be queryable if extension is disabled
PASS Successfully enabled OES_vertex_array_object extension
PASS OES_vertex_array_object listed as supported and getExtension succeeded
Testing binding enum with extension enabled
PASS ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES is 0x85B5
