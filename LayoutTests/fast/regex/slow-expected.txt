Test for expressions that would hang when evaluated due to exponential matching behavior. If the test does not hang it is a success.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS /(?:[^(?!)]||){23}z/.test("/(?:[^(?!)]||){23}z/") is false
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
