    We have two regions in the code, both regions have auto-height. The content will fit into the first region, and the second region won't be displayed.
    In this case we can't apply the shape on the region. The content should fill the grey rectangle without any left offset.

<p>Bug <a href="http://webkit.org/b/123103">123103</a>: [CSS Shapes][CSS Regions] Don't apply shape-inside when we have multiple auto-height regions and the height is not resolved</p>
