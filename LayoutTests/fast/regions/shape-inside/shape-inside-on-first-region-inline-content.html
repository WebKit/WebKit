    Despite the passage of time, Major Quilan still suffers grief and bereavement from the death of his wife, killed during the Chelgrian civil war that resulted from the Culture's
    interference. Quilan is offered the chance to avenge the lost Chelgrians who died in the civil war and is inducted into a plot to strike back at the Culture. As part of the plot,
    his "soulkeeper" (a device normally used to store its owner's personality upon their death) is equipped with both the mind of a long-dead Chelgrian general and a devicethat can
    transport wormholes connected to weapons caches. Quilan is then sent to Masaq' Orbital, ostensibly to persuade Mahrai Ziller to return to his native Chel but is in reality on a
    suicide mission to destroy the Orbital's Hub Mind. To protect him from detection at Masaq', Quilan's memory is selectively blanked until he reaches his target.

<p>Requires Ahem font. The inline content flows into two regions, a 250x300px rectangle shape-inside property with 50px left offset is applied to the first (orange) region. The content should have a 50px left offset in the orange rectangle and should flow into second rectangle without any offset.<br/>
<p>Bug <a href="http://webkit.org/b/115456">115456</a>: [CSS Regions][CSS Exclusions] Shape-inside on regions should respect region borders and paddings</p>
