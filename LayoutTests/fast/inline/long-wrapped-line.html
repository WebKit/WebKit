    <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Side note. &nbsp;Both GR's have been cleaned by both myself and
Miguet - &nbsp;Please keep our GR's clean or there will be Fire and
Brimstone. &nbsp;The state of the GR2 today was&nbsp;Unacceptable
with&nbsp;random&nbsp;parts that were&nbsp;suppose&nbsp;to be KGB that
were not labeled, &nbsp;RTW, &nbsp;RFP and attached to a machine in
awaiting parts. . &nbsp;
