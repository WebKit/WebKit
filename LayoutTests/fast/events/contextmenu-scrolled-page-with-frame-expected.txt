This tests that context menu events are sent to the correct frame when a page is scrolled. To test manually, scroll the page so that the top of the iframe is flush with the top of the web page area, then right-click just below the iframe. You should get a context menu that does not contain any mention of frames.


PASS: main document received a context menu event
