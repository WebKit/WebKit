This test requires WebKitTestRunner. To manually test, load the page in a configuration where drag and drop is enabled by default; start a drag on the image above by long-pressing it, and then drag the image off to the side of the screen and let go. 'dragstart' and 'dragend' events should be dispatched.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
