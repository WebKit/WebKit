This tests that DOM keydown and keyup events are dispatched to a non-editable <body> on iOS for hardware key presses of non-special keys. To run this test manually, verify that two messages are emitted when you press the following keys: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, -, =, [, ], \, ;, ', ,, ., /.
