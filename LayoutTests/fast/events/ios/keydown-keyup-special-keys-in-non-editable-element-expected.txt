This tests that DOM keydown and keyup events are dispatched to a non-editable <body> on iOS when pressing special keys on a hardware keyboard. To run this test manually, verify that two messages are emitted when you press the following keys: ↑, ↓, ←, →, Delete, End, Enter, Escape, Home, Insert, left Alt, left ⌘ Command, left Ctrl, left ⇧ Shift, Page Down, Page Up, Return, right Alt, right ⌘ Command, right Ctrl, right ⇧ Shift, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20, F21, F22, F23, F24.
