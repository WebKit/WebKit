This tests pressing a mouse button down inside a dragstart event.
This happens when a user sets a breakpoint of a dragstart event handler in Inspector, and clicks somewhere on the page while the script is paused at the breakpoint. WebKit should not crash.

PASS - mouse up and down inside a dragstart did not crash WebKit
