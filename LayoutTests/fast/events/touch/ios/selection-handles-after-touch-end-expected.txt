WK

This test verifies that selection handles are present after selecting a word via long press. To manually test, long press the word 'WK' until a selection highlight is shown, and verify that selection handles are present after ending the touch.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
