This test verifies that a tap-and-half gesture dispatches touch events when the page is zoomed in. To manually run the test, tap the red square and then immediately perform a pan gesture starting in the same location as the tap. The resulting events should consist of 'touchstart', 'touchend', 'touchstart', one or more 'touchmove', and finally a 'touchend'.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
