<UL class="two" style="background-color: gray;">
<LI>The left padding on this unordered list has been set to 25 pixels, which will require some extra test in order to test.</LI>
<LI class="two" style="background-color: white;">Another list item might not be such a bad idea, either, considering that such things do need to be double-checked.  This list item has its left padding also set to 25 pixels, which should combine with the list's padding to make 50 pixels of margin.
