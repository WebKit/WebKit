This test enables back-forward WebKit page cache for the duration of the test. The test enables cache, navigates to page-1, then to page-2 and then does history.back() to page-1. On navigation back to page-1, test verifies that previously-initialized timer continues to fire and onload is not called again. If test fails it hangs or outputs 'FAIL' below.
