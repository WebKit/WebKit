<h1>Inheritance bug for floated first-letter </h1>

<p> Here is the first paragraph. Here the CSS :first-line rule
sets the text to a green, sans-serif font.   Then, the CSS :first-letter
rule sets the font size to 3em, and makes the text bold. And here's some
more text to pad out the paragraph and make things look nice (or, at least,
to illustrate the problem correctly).
</p>

<p class="floated"> Here is the second paragraph. This is just like
the first except that the rule p.floated:first-letter floats the first 
letter to the left.  However, this floated element should still inherit
the font properties (green and sans-serif) from the first-line: selector.
It does not -- instead, the font is black, and uses the serif font.
.... And here's some
more text ....
</p>
