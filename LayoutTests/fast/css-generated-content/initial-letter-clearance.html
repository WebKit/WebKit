<div>
Just an example of first-letter. This letter should span 3 lines of text, and
so it should align itself cleanly with the cap-height of the J lining up with
the cap-height of the first line, and the baseline of the J lining up with the
baseline of the third line. The descender of the J is still avoided by following lines. This paragraph cleared the short paragraph.
