There was a bug that users could input text longer than maxlength via IME. This test confirms it was fixed.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS input.value.substring(input.selectionStart, input.selectionEnd) is "ab"
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
