This test verifies that we don't crash when selecting a datalist suggestion, if the suggestions list is reloaded during the click (after mousedown and before mouseup). To manually run the test, click 'Foo' in the datalist dropdown. The application should not crash.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
