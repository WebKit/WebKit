This test used to check that the selection start was the same before and after a change to the contents of a textarea.

However now, in order to match the behavior of the other major browsers, selection is moved to the end of the text value when a change occurs to the contents of a text area.

Because this would invalidate the previous test, and that the previous test now perfectly shows the new behavior, we repurposed it.
