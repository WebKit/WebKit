Test for bug 18401 Apparent caching between form submits.

In this test the main page is loaded in a frameset, which sets the value of an input field in a form and has an iframe, which loads a page which submits the form. The form's target is the main page. When the form is reloaded it should not have the value that was set before the submission.
