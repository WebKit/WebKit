This test verifies that tapping in a misspelled word selects the misspelled word, and does not cause the selection to collapse after a click event is dispatched. To manually test, tap the input field to bring up the keyboard, and then tap on a part of the word in the input field that is far away from the editing caret. As a result, the contents of the input should be selected and marked as a misspelled word.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS input.selectionStart is 0
PASS input.selectionEnd is 7
