This test verifies that when programmatically clicking a file input while focusing an editable control with a software keyboard attached, the file upload context menu is presented above the software keyboard. To manually test, click the 'Show file picker' button without a hardware keyboard attached, and verify that the context menu is visible.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
