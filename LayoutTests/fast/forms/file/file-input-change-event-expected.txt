PASS changeDispatched is true
PASS singleFileInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\bar.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is false
PASS singleFileInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\foo.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is true
Test that the 'change' event is triggered on a multiple file form when a selected file is changed:
PASS multipleFilesInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\foo.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is true
PASS multipleFilesInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\bar.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is true
PASS multipleFilesInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\bar.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is false
PASS multipleFilesInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\foo.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is true
Test that the 'change' event is triggered on a multiple file form when selected files are changed:
