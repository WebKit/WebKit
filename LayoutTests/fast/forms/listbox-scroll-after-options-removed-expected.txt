Bug 15252: <select multiple> doesn't scroll to top when old options are removed and new ones are added, leaving listbox empty-looking
When the test runs, all the <option>s in the select are removed and replaced with 1 new option. If the bug is present, the select will appear empty until you scroll up with the mousewheel.


Test Passed
