<p>The first grapheme cluster here contains three code points: two characters (Lo unicode category) which join up to be drawn with a single glyph, and a third code point which is a nonspacing mark (Mn unicode category), which is drawn as a second glyph on top of the first glyph, using a negative advance. This run has an initial advance.</p>
