This test hits a codepath where codepoints were being combined before they were being input into our glyph cache.
This character occurs just before combining marks in Unicode, and therefore was being erroneously combined. The test
passes if the glyph is drawn in a font other than LastResort (if the test fails, the character looks like a box or like
three horizontal lines).
