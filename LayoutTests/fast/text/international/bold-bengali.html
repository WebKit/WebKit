<p>This test verifies we can render bold Bengali properly.  (This is complicated on Linux because it's typically covered
by fake-bolded FreeSans even though there's also a FreeSansBold available.)</p>

<p>The test passes if the two words below look similar, but the top one is bold.  There should be no missing-glyph
boxes.</p>

<p><b>বাংলা</b><p>
<p>বাংলা</p>
