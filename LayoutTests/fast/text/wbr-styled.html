<p>
    This tests that <tt>WBR</tt> elements cannot be styled and that setting their <tt>position</tt> to <tt>absolute</tt> does not crash WebKit.
</p>
<p>
    There should be no <wbr style="border: 5px solid red;">red on this line.
</p>
<p>
    No crashing, please<wbr style="position: absolute;">.
