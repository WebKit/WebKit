    <title>Fake italic layout test</title>

  <body>
    <p>This layout test is designed to test that our fake italic mode is working correctly. The Ahem font, used below, does not include an italic variant. Thus, when we ask for italic Ahem, we should skew the glyphs ourselves, resulting in a series of italic black boxes below.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Ahem; font-style: italic;">A A A A</p>
