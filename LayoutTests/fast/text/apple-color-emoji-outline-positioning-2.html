This test makes sure glyphs rendered with Apple Color Emoji are in the right place. This test passes if the only thing you see on this page other than the text you're reading right now is a normal-looking emoji smiley face (without anything over it). This page renders some additional text, but covers up the locations where it's supposed to appear with white rectangles.
