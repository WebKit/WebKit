<p>The single Hebrew glyph below should be in the Lucida Grande font.  It should not be a synthetic bold, because the first font in the list (Ahem)
does not have the glyph.  Therefore we fall back to the second font in the list (Lucida Grande), which does support bold.  This test is making sure
we don't make incorrect assumptions based off the fact that we would have to synthesize bold for the first font in the list.
