This test makes sure that the "lang" attribute is properly consulted when using fallback fonts. The first character
is shown with a lang which represents Simplified Chinese, and the second character is shown with a lang which
represents Traditional Chinese. The character is one which is drawn differently in the two languages, so the
two characters should look different. This tests against a hardcoded font selection which should be the result of
FontCache::systemFallbackForCharacters().
