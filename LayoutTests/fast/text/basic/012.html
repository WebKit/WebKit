<h2>Safari Whitespace/Non-ASCII Bug</h2>
<p>Apart from whitespace (tab and linefeed characters), the two lists below (in red) use identical HTML. 
Both lists should be rendered on a single line. In Safari, however, the first list shows each item on a separate line.</p>
<p>This bug only seems to occur if the bullet character is non-ASCII (has a Unicode value higher than 127). Non-breaking spaces (&amp;#160;), however, are an exception.</p><br>
