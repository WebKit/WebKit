This test passes if there is no ASSERT in debug mode. This happens when:
No one uses the CSS Font Loading API
A font starts loading
Someone uses the CSS Font Loading API, causing us to create Javascript wrappers for our internal objects
The font finishes loading
The bug occurs when the wrappers do not correctly understand that there are in-flight loads already happening.
Hello
