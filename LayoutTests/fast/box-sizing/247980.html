<!-- The box produced by this hr element should be identical in size
     to one with a width and height of 1in in CSS units, since 1em is
     defined as the nominal font size, which has been set to 96px. And
     that dimension 96px is in turn required by the CSS standard to equal
     1in. Also, the box should in either case measure exactly one inch on
     screen, but it's not clear to me how to test that in WebKit's testing
     framework.
