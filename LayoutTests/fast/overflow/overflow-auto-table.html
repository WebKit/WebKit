<title>Table-Width Problem</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This tests the interaction of overflow on some very wide text with
auto table layout. The CSS 2.1 spec does not define how overflow
interacts with intrinsic width, so we copy the IE behavior. Therefore
the lines should come out very very wide and scroll along with the
border.</p>
<table style="border: 1px solid red; width: 80%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre style="overflow:auto; border: 1px solid blue">
