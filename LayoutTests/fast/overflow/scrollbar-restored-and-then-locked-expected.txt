Test for bug 29431 [Qt] REGRESSION:(r50665) QWebFrame::setScrollBarPolicy(Qt::Vertical,Qt::ScrollBarAlwaysOff) has no effect.

This test ensures the correctness of two scrollbar behaviour:

This tests that after setting 'overflow' on the document element to 'hidden' and back to 'visible', scrollbars appear as necessary.
After explicitly setting a scrollbar policy different than 'auto', WebCore honors that until it is unset.
