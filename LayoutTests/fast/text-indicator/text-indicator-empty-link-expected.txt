TEST COMPLETE
Â 
To test manually, force click on macOS or begin a drag on iPadOS here. The preview highlight rect or targeted drag preview (respectively) should encompass the entire window, instead of just a tiny piece of empty text in the upper left hand corner.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
