          (Selection Background Color Error)

This bug is caused when the selection background is inverted if it
is the same as the text color.  However, it should compare against
the selected text color instead of the non-selected text color.

The alpha component must be non-opaque for the bug to get triggered.
This is because when the selection background is opaque, it will be
blended with white, which prevents the inversion.
