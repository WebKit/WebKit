<p>Repaint test for <rdar><!-- 
Oh man, let me explain why this is here.  In the beginning, there was an
<rdar:://problem/6869687> link to the great and mysterious rdar.  However, that
link was invisible because whoever added it decided to enclose the link in
angle brackets.

There was peace in the land, until we implemented the HTML5 parsing algorithm,
which changed the name of the mysterious rdar element to not include //
charaters.  Rather than regenerate the expected results (which were platform
specific), our hero changed the rdar link to an <rdar> element and hand-edited
the expected render tree.

And on the third day, he rested. --> REGRESSION (r41203): Facebook friend suggestions disappear on update.  Make sure when a layer switches
from being self-painting to non-self-painting that a layout happens to fix up the floating objects lists.  You should see a 100x100 green square below.
If you see any red, the test has failed.
