This page's JavaScript calls console.profile() but not console.profileEnd(). 

To run this test manually, load it in the browser then load the WebInspector and look at the profile. You should see the profile running (when that feature is implemented 6060556). Then navigate to another page and check the WebInspector again. Safari should not have crashed and the Inspector should not show a profile (unless we allow cross-load profiling in the future 5951478 5954912).
