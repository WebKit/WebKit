Make sure the same deserialization of the state object is used every time (both in the history object and popstate events).

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS history.state is defined.
PASS history.state === history.state is true
PASS history.state !== stateObject is true
PASS history.state === stateObject is true

Inside popstate event

PASS history.state !== stateObject is true
PASS popStateEvent.state !== stateObject is true
FAIL popStateEvent.state === history.state should be true. Was false.
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
