Policy delegate: attempt to load http://a=a&b=b/ with navigation type 'other'
Tests that we do not redirect to an invalid URL initiated by JavaScript. This test PASSED if you see an entry in the dumped frame load callbacks of the form: "willPerformClientRedirectToURL: http://A=a&B=b" followed by "didCancelClientRedirectForFrame".

Note, this test must be run in DumpRenderTree.
