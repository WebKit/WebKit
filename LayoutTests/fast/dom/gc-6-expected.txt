This test verifies that DOM documents are protected against garbage collection but without necessarily keeping all their children alive, so long as any node in the document is reachable.

The output should be the following pieces of text on lines by themselves: "B", "[object HTMLElement]", "null", "[object HTMLDocument]".

B
[object HTMLSpanElement]
[object HTMLSpanElement]
[object HTMLDocument]
