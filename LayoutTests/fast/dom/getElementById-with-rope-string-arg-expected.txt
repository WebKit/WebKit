This tests that calling getElementById() with a concatenated string as the argument doesn't make us crash on subsequent access to that string.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS nonexistentID is 'somethingfoobar'
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
