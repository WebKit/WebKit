This doc should only be opened by open.html.

If this doc did not submit itself then this window would have no history and 
always be allowed to close.  We need to test that the window can close because 
it was opened by the DOM.

If running this test manually, click the send button below if you are not redirected.

    <input name="send" value="Send" id="SendButton" type="submit">
