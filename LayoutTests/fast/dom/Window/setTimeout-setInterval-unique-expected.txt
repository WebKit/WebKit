This checks that setTimeout() and setInterval() return unique results within their script execution context.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Checking the results of setTimeout:
PASS tID1 > 0 is true
PASS tID2 > 0 is true
PASS tID3 > 0 is true
PASS tID1 !== tID2 is true
PASS tID1 !== tID3 is true
PASS tID2 !== tID3 is true

Checking the results of setInterval:
PASS iID1 > 0 is true
PASS iID2 > 0 is true
PASS iID3 > 0 is true
PASS iID1 !== iID2 is true
PASS iID1 !== iID3 is true
PASS iID2 !== iID3 is true
