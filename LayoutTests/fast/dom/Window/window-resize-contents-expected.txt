CONSOLE MESSAGE: Initial reference node dimensions 800 x 600
CONSOLE MESSAGE: Increasing window size by 10 x 10
CONSOLE MESSAGE: Post-resize reference node dimensions 810 x 610
This test checks that the yellow reference DOM node (which should be as big as the window) gets resized when the window is resized.

To avoid relayouts and repaints caused by DOM-based logging, it doesn't output anything. Please check the console for confirmation that the node dimensions increase by 10x10.
