This test verifies that DOM nodes are retained because a wrapper exists for a descendant. A wrapper need not exist for the node itself or for an ancestor.

The output should be the following pieces of text on lines by themselves: "replacement content", "B", "parent node exists", "child node exists".

replacement content
B
parent node exists
child node exists
