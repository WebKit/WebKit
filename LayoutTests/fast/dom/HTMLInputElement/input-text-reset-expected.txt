 Reset Button
This test verifies that text-type input form controls are properly reset by both a reset input control and a reset button control.
(But file input element values can't be modified by JS, so this test can't be used for those.)

You should see six element IDs below, and the word "SUCCESS" twice after each:

textEmpty : SUCCESS : SUCCESS 
textValue : SUCCESS : SUCCESS 
passwordEmpty : SUCCESS : SUCCESS 
passwordValue : SUCCESS : SUCCESS
