 Reset Button
This test verifies that check-type input form controls are properly reset by both a reset input control and a reset button control.

You should see four element IDs below, and the word "SUCCESS" twice after each:

checkboxUnchecked : SUCCESS : SUCCESS
checkboxChecked : SUCCESS : SUCCESS
radioUnchecked : SUCCESS : SUCCESS
radioChecked : SUCCESS : SUCCESS
