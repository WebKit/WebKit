This test calls comparePoint on detached nodes. They should compare nodes when they're in the same detached tree and throw otherwise.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS var range = new Range; range.setStart(detachedDiv, 0); range.comparePoint(detachedDiv, 0); is 0
PASS var range = new Range; range.setStart(detachedDiv, 0); range.comparePoint(detachedDiv, 1); is 1
PASS var range = new Range; range.setStart(detachedDiv, 2); range.comparePoint(detachedDiv, 1); is -1
PASS var range = new Range; range.setStart(spanInDetachedDiv1, 0); range.comparePoint(spanInDetachedDiv2, 0); is 1
PASS var range = new Range; range.setStart(spanInDetachedDiv2, 0); range.comparePoint(spanInDetachedDiv1, 0); is -1
