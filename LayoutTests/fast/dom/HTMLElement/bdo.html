<p>Tests: the bdo tag</p>
<p>The bdo element overrides the default text direction.
</p>
<p>If successful, the first sentence would be backward, and the second sentence regular. There should then be an extra 
blank line, followed by a line reading only "A," and finally, a sentence where only the word "umbrella" is backward.</p>

<bdo dir="rtl">This sentence should be backward.</bdo>

<bdo dir="ltr">This sentence should be forward.</bdo>

<bdo dir="ltr">My <bdo dir="rtl">umbrella</bdo> sure would be useful in this rain.</bdo>
