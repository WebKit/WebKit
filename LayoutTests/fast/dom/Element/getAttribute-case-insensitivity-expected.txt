Test for Bugzilla bug: 105713: getAttribute does not behave correctly for mixed-case attributes on HTML testements.
This test verifies that the getAttribute() and the getAttributeNode() APIs convert the passed attribute name to lowercase before comparing against existing attributes.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS test.getAttribute('NEWATTR') is 'PASS'
PASS test.getAttributeNode('NEWATTR').value is 'PASS'
PASS test.getAttributeNS(null, 'NEWATTR') is 'FAIL'
PASS test.getAttribute('newattr') is 'PASS'
PASS test.getAttributeNode('newattr').value is 'PASS'
PASS test.getAttributeNS(null, 'newattr') is 'PASS'
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
