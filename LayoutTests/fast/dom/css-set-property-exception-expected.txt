Test for bug 7296.

This test checks to see whether you get exceptions when setting a property with a "bad value". Setting using JavaScript property syntax and with setProperty() should behave the same.

It is OK if the order of properties changes from the expected results - IE 6 and Firefox 2 don't agree on it anyway.

This is the test element.
