This test checks to see if the DOM ContainerNode's NodeList cache is correctly invalidated when new content is parsed.

If the test passes, you should see "before: not found", "after: found" and "onload: found".

If the cache is not invalidated when the testElement is parsed, both before and after will be "not found", which is a failure.

before: not found
after: found
onload: found
