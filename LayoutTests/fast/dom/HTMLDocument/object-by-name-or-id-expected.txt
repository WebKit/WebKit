This tests when object elements are accessible by name or id directly as properties of the document object. IE allows this only if the object has not child nodes other than param and whitespace anonymous text. A PASS result means that behavior matches IE. WebKitâ€™s results for comments differ.

Results:

By name:
no children: PASS
param: PASS
param and whitespace: PASS
param and empty comment: PASS
param and non-empty comment: PASS
param and text: PASS
param and img: PASS

By id:
no children: PASS
param: PASS
param and whitespace: PASS
param and empty comment: PASS
param and non-empty comment: PASS
param and text: PASS
param and img: PASS
