CONSOLE MESSAGE: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to initiate navigation for frame with URL 'navigate-top-to-fail.html'. The frame attempting navigation of the top-level window is sandboxed, but the 'allow-top-navigation' flag is not set.

CONSOLE MESSAGE: SecurityError: The operation is insecure.
This test verifies that a sandboxed IFrame cannot navigate the top-level frame without allow-top-navigation. This test passes if the navigation does not occur.
