CONSOLE MESSAGE: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to initiate navigation for frame with URL 'sandboxed-iframe-navigation-source.html'. The frame attempting navigation is sandboxed, and is therefore disallowed from navigating its ancestors.

CONSOLE MESSAGE: SecurityError: The operation is insecure.
This test verifies that a sandboxed IFrame cannot navigate an ancestor in the frame tree by assigning the location attribute.

This is done by loading ten non-sandboxed IFrames, and a single sandboxed one. Expect ten frames to be navigated, but the sandboxed one to not be one of them.

This test will print "PASS" on success.


PASS
