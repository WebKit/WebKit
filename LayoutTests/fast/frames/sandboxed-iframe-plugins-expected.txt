This test verifies that sandboxing of plugins works as intended. Three tests are made, each in one sandboxed and one non-sandboxed IFrame: applets, embeds, and objects.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


NOTE: The first sub-test will fail in DumpRenderTree, since DumpRenderTree does not support applets. That sub-test must be run in Safari instead.
