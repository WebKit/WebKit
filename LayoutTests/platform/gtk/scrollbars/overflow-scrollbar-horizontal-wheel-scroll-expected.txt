Test for bug 29348: This tests that using the mouse wheel while having the pointer in a horizontal scrollbar makes it scroll horizontally, also with styled scrollbars. On success, the vertical offset for both divs should be 80, and the horizonta 40.

Scroll offset for 'overflow' is 80 and 40
Scroll offset for 'styled' is 80 and 40
