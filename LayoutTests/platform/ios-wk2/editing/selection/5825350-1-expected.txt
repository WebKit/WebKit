CONSOLE MESSAGE: TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'textInputController.selectedRange()')
This tests for a bug where moving the caret left towards a non-editable pocket of an editable region would make the caret disappear. The caret should be just before the 'B' in "Bob".
Bob ; Sally
