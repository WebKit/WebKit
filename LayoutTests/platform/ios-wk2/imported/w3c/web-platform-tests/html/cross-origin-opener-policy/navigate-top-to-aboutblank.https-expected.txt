Non-initial empty documents (about:blank) should inherit their cross-origin-opener-policy from the navigation's initiator top level document, if the initiator and its top level document are same-origin, or default (to unsafe-none) otherwise.

Create the opener popup with a given COOP openerCOOP.
Add iframe to the opener popup that is either same-origin or cross-origin.
Opener opens a new window, to a network document with the same origin and COOP value as opener.
Opener's iframe navigates its parent frame (opener) to about:blank.
Verify the openee still has access to its opener.
