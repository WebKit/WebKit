CONSOLE MESSAGE: Refused to load plugin data from 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/plugins/resources/mock-plugin-with-csp.pl' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "object-src 'none'".

This tests that a plugin served with a CSP header will block the plugin from running in an iframe. This test passes if a console error says that the plugin was blocked.
