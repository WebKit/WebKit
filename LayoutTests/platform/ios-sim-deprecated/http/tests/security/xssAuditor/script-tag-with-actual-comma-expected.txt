CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 4: The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in 'http://localhost:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?q=%3Cscript%3E/**/0,0/*,*/-alert(0)%3C/script%3E' because its source code was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server sent neither an 'X-XSS-Protection' nor 'Content-Security-Policy' header.
Test that the XSSAuditor's tolerance for the IIS webserver's comma concatenation doesn't open holes when the reflected argument contains an actual comma. The test passes if the XSSAuditor logs console messages and no alerts fire.
