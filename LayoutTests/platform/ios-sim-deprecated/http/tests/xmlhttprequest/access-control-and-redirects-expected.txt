CONSOLE MESSAGE: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8000/resources/redirect.php?url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/access-control-basic-allow.cgi. Origin http://127.0.0.1:8000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
Tests that redirects between origins are never allowed, even when access control is involved.

Per the spec, these test cases should be allowed, but cross-origin redirects are currently unsupported in WebCore.
