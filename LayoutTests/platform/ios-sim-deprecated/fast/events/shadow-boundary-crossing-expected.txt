The mouseover/mouseout event between two elements inside the same shadow subtree should not propagate out of the shadow DOM: PASS
The mouseover/mouseout event on a shadow subtree host should propagate out of the shadow DOM: PASS
Label should look beyond shadow boundary to detect if it encloses its associated element: PASS
Events for default event handler should not be retargeted: PASS
Event's relatedTarget should be retargeted: PASS
Other events should be retargeted: PASS
