Test ECDH deriveBits operation for corner-case length values.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS deriveBits(..., 0) successfully derived 256 bits for a P-256 curve
PASS deriveBits(..., 8) successfully derived 8 bits for a P-256 curve
PASS deriveBits(..., 256) successfully derived 256 bits for a P-256 curve
PASS Bit derivations for EC P-256 with minimum and maximum lengths succeeded
PASS deriveBits(P256, 256 + 8) rejected promise  with OperationError: The operation failed for an operation-specific reason.
PASS deriveBits(..., 0) successfully derived 384 bits for a P-384 curve
PASS deriveBits(..., 8) successfully derived 8 bits for a P-384 curve
PASS deriveBits(..., 384) successfully derived 384 bits for a P-384 curve
