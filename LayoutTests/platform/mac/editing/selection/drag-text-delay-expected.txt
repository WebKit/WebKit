On most platforms, if you click and move the mouse on selected text, it will always initiate a drag. On Mac, there must be a delay between the click and the mouse move before a drag starts. Otherwise, it will just change the selection.

To manually test, select "hello" and rapidly drag. You should see "hello world" on Mac and "worldhello" on all other platforms.

hello world
