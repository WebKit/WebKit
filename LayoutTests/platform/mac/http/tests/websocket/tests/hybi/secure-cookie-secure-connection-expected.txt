Test WebSocket sends Secure cookies over secure connections.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Note: mod_pywebsocket does not send secure cookies ('see FIXMEs in mod_pywebsocket code'), so this test is expected to FAIL to return WK-websocket-test-secure=1 until that bug is fixed.

See pywebsocket Bug 150 for details.
