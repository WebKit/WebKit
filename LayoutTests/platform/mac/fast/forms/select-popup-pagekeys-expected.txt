This test verifies that the Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys work correctly for pop-up <select> elements that have focus but are not currently popped-up.

Output below is a series of PASS or FAIL lines showing expected and actual selection indexes, followed by a single PASS or FAIL for the status of the entire test.

NOTE: This test will fail on Mac OS, on which these keys are NOT supposed to change the selection of a focused pop-up.
