CONSOLE MESSAGE: Blocked mixed content http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/mixedContent/resources/dummy.swf because 'block-all-mixed-content' appears in the Content Security Policy.
This test opens a window and loads an insecure plugin. We should trigger a mixed content block because the main frame in the window has CSP directive block-all-mixed-content.
