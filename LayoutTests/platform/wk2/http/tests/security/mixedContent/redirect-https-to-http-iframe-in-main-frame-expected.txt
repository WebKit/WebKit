CONSOLE MESSAGE: [blocked] The page at about:blank was not allowed to display insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/boring.html.

This test opens a window that loads an insecure iframe (via a tricky redirect). We should trigger a mixed content callback because the main frame in the window is HTTPS but is displaying content that can be controlled by an active network attacker.
