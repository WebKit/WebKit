CONSOLE MESSAGE: The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-redirect-https-to-http-image-secure-cookie.html was allowed to display insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/resources/compass.jpg.

This test opens a window that reads a secure cookie and then loads an insecure image (via a tricky redirect). This should not block the insecure image from loading even though a secure cookie was accessed, because an insecure image can only affect pixels on screen, not expose private data.
