CONSOLE MESSAGE: The page at https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-image.html was allowed to display insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/resources/compass.jpg.

This test opens a window that loads an insecure image. We should trigger a mixed content callback because the main frame in the window is HTTPS but is displaying insecure content.
