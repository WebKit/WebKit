127.0.0.1:8000 - didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge - ProtectionSpaceAuthenticationSchemeHTTPBasic - Responding with testUser:testPassword
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66354
You should load this page at 127.0.0.1:8000 because the test relies on redirects within the 127.0.0.1:8000 security origin.
This test loads a py script which demands http authentication, then uses it to redirect to another script in the same origin that shows what authentication headers were sent with the final request.
The redirect includes credentials in the location url, and they should be preferred over credentials that WebCore has cached.
It does this once each for HTTP 301, 302, 303, and 307 redirects.
If not running under DRT, enter any credentials when asked.
