Tests that accessing the script object of a plug-in that hasn't been initialized fails instead of waiting for initialization to finish.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS Accessing the property took less than 550ms, meaning the plug-in had not finished initializing after our call to the plug-in script object returned.
