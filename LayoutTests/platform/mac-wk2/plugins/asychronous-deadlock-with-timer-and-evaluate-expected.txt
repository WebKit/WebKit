Test that a plug-in initializing asynchronous that calls out to NPP_Evaluate within NPP_New doesn't deadlock against a WebProcess that is trying to call in to the plug-in element, waiting for it to complete initialization.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS Waiting on synchronous initialization of the plug-in instance did not deadlock the Web and Plugin processes.
