# These are the layout test expectations for the EFL port(s) of WebKit.
#
# See http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/TestExpectations for more information on this file.

# We divide our test_expectations.txt into several categories:
# 0. TESTS MIGRATED OVER FROM THE SKIPPED FILE
#
# 1. TESTS EXPECTED TO FAIL
#    Test cases related to features that we don't expect to be activated for EFL since e.g.
#    * the feature implementation in WebCore is not complete yet
#    * the feature is not relevant for the EFL port
#    * the feature is meant to solve a backwards compatibility issue on other platforms
#    Test cases that don't apply for the EFL platform permanently.
#    If in doubt, please discuss on webkit-efl mailing list whether a set of test cases
#    should be moved here.

# 2. CRASHES

# 3. FLAKY TESTS

# 4. FAILING TESTS
#    * Interim failures that are moved here for further investigation as a result of daily
#      gardening. They should be analysed quickly and either resolved or moved to 1).
#    * Remaining failures that are moved here until further investigation after
#      unskipping a directory or block of tests in the Skipped list. Mark cases as MISSING
#      if you cannot yet generate new results since another feature is missing.
#    * Tests that we expect to pass once the respective fix for DRT is available or
#      a relevant compile time feature can be enabled for EFL.


# Each line should have an associated bug. Please don't file new lines without one.
