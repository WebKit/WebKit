This test checks whether DOM wrappers created by NodeIterator have their prototypes attached to the correct objects. These nodes are from the child frame, so that's where their prototypes should be attached.

Unfortunately, our implementation is buggy and we get wrappers from the parent frame here. This test documents the bug so we'll know when we fix it.
