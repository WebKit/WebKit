ALERT: PASS: Exception thrown successfully.
The scenario for this test is that you have an iframe with content from a foreign domain. In that foreign content is an iframe which loads a data: URL. This tests that the data: URL loaded iframe does not have access to the main frame using top.document.


Pass: Cross frame access from a data: URL on a different domain was denied.
