This page opens a window to "", injects malicious code, and then navigates its opener to the victim. The opened window then tries to scripts its opener after document.writeing a new document.
Code injected into window:
<script>document.write('<script>function write(target, message) { target.document.body.innerHTML = message; }setTimeout(function() {write(window.opener, \'FAIL: XSS was allowed.\');}, 100);setTimeout(function() {write(window.opener.top.frames[1], \'SUCCESS: Window remained in original SecurityOrigin.\');}, 200);setTimeout(function() { if (window.layoutTestController) layoutTestController.globalFlag = true; }, 300);<\/script>');</script>
