// This file consists of lines with specifications of what
// to expect from layout test cases. The test cases can be directories
// in which case the expectations apply to all test cases in that
// directory and any subdirectory. The format of the file is along the
// lines of:
//
// fast/js/fixme.js = FAIL
// fast/js/flaky.js = FAIL PASS
// fast/js/crash.js = CRASH TIMEOUT FAIL PASS
//
// The format of a test line is as follows:
// METADATA : relative/path/to/test.html = EXPECTATIONS
//
// Valid values for METADATA:
//
// BUG(CR|WK|V8_)[0-9]+: See this chromium/webkit/v8 bug for more information.
//                       Every test that isn't marked WONTFIX should have the
//                       appropriate BUG annotation.
// SKIP: Doesn't run the test.
// SLOW: The test takes a long time to run, but does not timeout indefinitely.
// WONTFIX: For tests that we never intend to pass on a given platform.
// DEBUG: Expectations apply only to the debug build.
// RELEASE: Expectations apply only to release build.
// LINUX/WIN/WIN-XP/WIN-VISTA/MAC: Expectations apply only to these platforms.
//
// Valid values for EXPECTATIONS:
//
// PASS: Test should pass
// CRASH: Test should crash
// TIMEOUT: Test should timeout
// IMAGE: Test will produce an incorrect image dump
// TEXT: Test will produce incorrect text output (either full or simplified)
// IMAGE+TEXT: Test will produce both incorrect text and images
// FAIL: Test will produce either incorrect text, images, or both
//
// If a line contains multiple expectations, it is considered "flakey",
// because it means that we're not producing consistent, reliable results.
//
// For example,
// LINUX : media = PASS FAIL
