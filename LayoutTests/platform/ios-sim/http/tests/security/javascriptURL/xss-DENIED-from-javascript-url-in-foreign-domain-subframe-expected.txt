CONSOLE MESSAGE: Blocked a frame with origin "http://localhost:8000" from accessing a frame with origin "http://127.0.0.1:8000". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
The scenario for this test is that you have an iframe with content from a foreign domain. In that foreign content is an iframe which loads a javascript: URL. This tests that the javascript: URL loaded iframe does not have access to the main frame using top.document.

Pass: Cross frame access from a javascript: URL on a different domain was denied.

--------
Frame: '<!--framePath //<!--frame0-->-->'
--------
Inner iframe on a foreign domain.



--------
Frame: 'aFrame'
--------
Inner-inner iframe. This iframe (which is javascript: URL and whose parent is on a foreign domain) is the frame attempting to access the main frame. It should not have access to it.
