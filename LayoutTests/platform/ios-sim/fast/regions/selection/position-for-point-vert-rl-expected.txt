Bug #120769 - [CSSRegions] Selection focusNode set to the "region" block, instead of the "source" block

Top margin, padding and border points should be mapped to the beginning of the Region block, while bottom points are mapped to the block end. The Left coordinate its just adjusted to fit in the Flow Thread boundaries, since its not affected by the Flow direction.

Test 1) Select from "word1" to "word2" and move down without leaving the region. Focus should be at the end of "word2". Selected content should go from "word1" to "word2". FAIL

Test 2) Select from "word1" to "word2" and move down until reaching the region border. Focus should be at the end of "word2". Selected content should go from "word1" to "word2". FAIL

Test 3) Select from "word1" to "word2" and move down leaving the block without entering in the next element. Focus should be at at the beginning of "outside". Selected content should go from "word1" to "word2" and from "word5" to "word6". FAIL

Test 4) Select from "word3" to "word4" and move down leaving the block without entering in the next element. Focus should be at at the beginning of "word5". Selected content should go from "word5" to "word6". FAIL

Test 5) Select from "word5" to "word6" and move down without leaving the region. Focus should be at the end of "word6". Selected content should go from "word5" to "word6". FAIL
