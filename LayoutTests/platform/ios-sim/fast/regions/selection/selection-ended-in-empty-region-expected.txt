word1 before empty region word2
after empty region
Test that when you start the selection outside an empty region and end the selection inside the empty region, only the content before the empty region is selected.

To manually test, start selection from "word1" and move to the middle of the box with black border, representing the empty region.

Focus node should be the empty region.

Selected content should go from "word1" to "word2": FAIL
