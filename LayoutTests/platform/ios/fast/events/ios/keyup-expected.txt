This tests that DOM keyup events are dispatched on iOS for hardware key presses. To run this test manually, focus the text field below and then verify that a message is emitted when you press the following keys: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, `, ~, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, _, =, +, [, ], {, }, \, |, ;, :, ', ", ,, <, ., >, /, ?, <return>.
