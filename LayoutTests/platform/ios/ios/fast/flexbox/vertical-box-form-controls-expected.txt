Check if form controls in vertical flex box will stretch horizontally when rendered as box as opposed to inline-box. If you see any red, then the test has failed. iOS has extra requirements for buttons to be styled; they must either have a transparent background, or a background image.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
