Test that playback is paused by an SuspendUnderLock, even when it is not paused by EnteringBackground, and that ending the interruption does not automatically resume playback.

Start
EVENT(canplaythrough)
RUN(video.play())
EVENT(playing)
RUN(video.webkitSetPresentationMode('picture-in-picture'))
RUN(internals.beginMediaSessionInterruption('EnteringBackground'))
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'false') OK
RUN(internals.beginMediaSessionInterruption('SuspendedUnderLock'))
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK
RUN(internals.endMediaSessionInterruption('MayResumePlaying'))
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK
RUN(internals.endMediaSessionInterruption(''))
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK
END OF TEST
