This tests pasting text into a table cell.  The last bit of content in the incoming fragment should be merged with the paragraph after the position being pasted into.

Before insertion:
| <tbody>
|   <tr>
|     <td>
|       <div>
|         id="test2"
|         "Item 1"
|     <td>
|       "Item 2"

After insertion:
| <tbody>
|   <tr>
|     <td>
|       <div>
|         id="test2"
|         "Item foo"
|       <div>
|         id="test2"
|         "bar<#selection-caret>1"
|     <td>
|       "Item 2"
