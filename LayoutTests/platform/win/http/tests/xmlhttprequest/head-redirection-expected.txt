This page tests redirection of HEAD requests with different codes (301, 302, 303, 307).
As described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics (in particular sections 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 7.4.4 and 7.4.7 as of version 22 of the document), a redirected HEAD request is expected to remain a HEAD request.

This test loads a web page that does a XHR HEAD request to a first script. This script does a redirection to a second script that sends a response containing the request method as a HTTP header.

HEAD-301 - expected HEAD and received GET
HEAD-302 - expected HEAD and received GET
HEAD-303 - expected HEAD and received GET
HEAD-307 - expected HEAD and received HEAD
