1.0 Single Argument Testing
The following tests every with one argument, the callback. It should print whether the arrays [2, 5, 8, 1, 4] and [12, 5, 8, 1, 44] contain any numbers >= to 10 (false and true, respectively).

false
true

2.0 Two Argument Testing
The following tests every with two arguments, the callback and the applied "this" object. It should print whether the arrays [2, 5, 8, 1, 4] and [12, 5, 8, 1, 44] contain any numbers >= 8. Both should yield "true".

true
true

3.0 Array Mutation Tests
These tests the affects of array mutation during execution of some.

3.1 Array Element Removal
This test is equivalent to 1.0, with the exception that it tests whether elements are >= 44 instead of 10, and that it removes elements from the array on each visit. Both should thus yield "false" since undefined is not >= to 44.

false
false

3.2 Array Element Addition
This test is equivalent to 1.0, with the exception that it adds elements greater than 10 to the end of the list. However, the results should be the same as those in 1.0 since some uses the original length to create the range it iterates over.

false
true

3.3 Array Element Changing
This test is equivalent to 1.0, with the exception that it changes elements in the array to be > 10 in reverse order. These elements should appear in their mutated form when reached by every, and thus both tests should result in "true".

true
true

4.0 Exception Test
This test uses a function that throws an exception, and thus halts the execution of some. There should be 2 exceptions thrown.

Exception thrown, execution halted!
Exception thrown, execution halted!

5.0 Wrong Type for Callback Test
This test sends in incorrect types for the callback parameter of every. An exception should be thrown in each case. There should be 6 type errors (and no crashes!):

TypeError: 5 is not a function
TypeError: wrong is not a function
TypeError: # is not a function
TypeError: null is not a function
TypeError: undefined is not a function
TypeError: undefined is not a function

6.0 Early Abortion ("Short Circuiting") This test is nearly identical to 1.0, except that it prints upon every call to the designated callback function. Since some aborts as soon as it finds one qualifying element, the first array should print 5 times, and the second only once.

Testing element 2...
Testing element 5...
Testing element 8...
Testing element 1...
Testing element 4...
Done with first array.
Testing element 12...
Done with second array.

7.0 Behavior with Holes in Arrays
This test checks that the callback function is not invoked for holes in the array. Five arrays are tested:

Testing element 2...
Testing element 8...
Testing element 1...
Testing element 4...
Done with first array.
Testing element undefined...
Done with second array.
Done with third array.
Done with fourth array.
Testing element undefined...
Done with fifth array.
