Pointer Event: Boundary event sequence at implicit capture release

Follow the test instructions with mouse. If you don't have the device skip it.

When a captured pointer is implicitly released after a click, the boundary events should follow the lostpointercapture event.

Click on the black box with mouse and do not move the mouse after or during the click.
