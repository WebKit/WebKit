This test checks that markers are correct when auto correcting in the blockquote. If you type "l" and " ", there should be blue dots under the word: "notational". This test also makes sure that the replacement does not cause breaking out of blockquotes.

PASS internals.hasAutocorrectedMarker(5, 10) is true
PASS document.querySelectorAll("blockquote").length is 1
PASS document.querySelector("blockquote").innerText.indexOf("notational") is 18
PASS successfullyParsed is true
