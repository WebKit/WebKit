Description

This test validates that for a cross origin resource, the timing allow check algorithm will fail when the value of Timing-Allow-Origin is NOT a case-sensitive match for the value of the origin of the current document.


PASS window.performance is defined
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByType is defined
PASS redirectStart, redirectEnd, domainLookupStart, domainLookupEnd, connectStart, connectEnd, secureConnectionStart, requestStart, and responseStart -- should be all returned as 0 when the value of Timing-Allow-Origin is NOT a case-sensitive match for the value of the origin of the current document and TAO algorithm passes
