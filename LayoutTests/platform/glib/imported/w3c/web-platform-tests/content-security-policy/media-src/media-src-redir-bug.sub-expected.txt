Video element in media-src list - redirect test

This test tests a buggy interaction in Chrome 46. Two hosts (self and www2) are both allowed as media-src, but only one (self) is allowed for connect-src. If a video src starts on an allowed host (self), and is redirected to another allowed media-src host, it should succeed. But a bug causes the redirect to be done in a fetch context to which connect-src is being applied instead, so the load is blocked. (This test passes in Firefox 45, modulo an event listener not firing.)
