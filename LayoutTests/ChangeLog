        setSelectionRange should set selection without validation

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        Fixed input-select-webkit-user-select-none.html which was erroneously asserting selectionStart and selectionEnd
        of a text field to be zero when it has -webkit-user-select: none. This doesn't not match behaviors of Chrome
        and Firefox. They both retain the programatically set selection offsets since such style should not bleed into
        the shadow DOM of the text field in the first place.

        New behavior matches the latest Firefox and Chrome although we still have the bug that user cannot select text
        inside such a text field.

        Also modernized LayoutTests/editing/selection/5497643.html to make the expected results more readable and made
        the test more robust against changes in the node index of textarea element.

        Refactoring design-mode-spellcheck-off.html to use asynchronous spellchecking

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Enable asynchronous spellchecking in design-mode-spellcheck-off.html.

        Due to js-test-pre.js adds some HTML elements inside the BODY, the misspelled
        phrase was moved into separated div element. It allows to check spelling marker
        on desired element instead of whole body.

        It turned out that the test does not underline "asdf" as misspelled although
        spellcheck attribute is on. To force spellchecking, the caret needs to be moved
        out of the misspelled word. To be more reliable, the test now contains two test
        cases in 'desingMode=on' when spellcheck attribute is off and on.

        Rubberstamped by Jer Noble.

        Take two.

        When I did this last night in r163923 the Mozilla tests outputted different results
        because one of the logging functions they made had become more verbose.

        This time we include the new test expectations for those tests, and update them to
        reflect the different exception message outputted in WebKit vs Blink.

        Position and thickness of underline as text size changes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16768

        This test draws underlined text at a very large font size. It then positions and clips
        the text so that the underline should fill a box if the underline grows in proportion
        to text size. The comparison is to a box that has its background color set.

        REGRESSION(r163660-r163664): js/dom/stack-trace.html fails.
        <https://webkit.org/b/128544>

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        The failing test is fragile. The test intends to test a recursion pattern
        i.e. the top of the stack trace should show a repeated cycle of certain
        function calls. However, the test makes a faulty assumption about which
        function in that recursion pattern will be the one that overflows the
        stack.

        The fix is to make the test check for repetition of that recursion pattern
        instead of making a specific assumption as to which function within that
        recursion pattern will overflow the stack.

        * TestExpectations: reverted skipped test.
        * js/dom/script-tests/stack-trace.js:
        (stackTraceLineFor):
        - refactored this code to generated the stack trace line out of printStack.
        (printStack):
        - updated to use stackTraceLineFor.

        - utility function to dump the recursion pattern being matched.
        (matchesPatternAtLine):
        (matchPattern):
        (checkStackForPattern):
        - utility functions for testing if the stack trace matches the expected
          recursion pattern. The pattern is an array of stack trace lines that
          we should see repeated in the stack trace starting from the top.

          The top line of the stack trace may match any line in the pattern.
          Thereafter, subsequent lines much patch lines in the pattern starting
          with the line after the first match. When we run out of pattern lines,
          we'll go back to the first pattern line and continue the matching test
          until we run out of stack trace lines to match.

          If any mismatch is found, the test fails.

        Use srcset's pixel density to determine intrinsic size
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123832

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The patch is a port of a similar Blink patch: https://codereview.chromium.org/25105004
        According to the spec "When an img element has a current pixel density that is not 1.0,
        the element's image data must be treated as if its resolution, in device pixels per CSS pixels,
        was the current pixel density."

        Layout test changes include modifications of existing tests to accomodate the new image dimensions, as well as new tests for this
        specific functionality.

        Need regression test for the debugger modifying locals in a DFG frame.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Regression test for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128112.

        This test does the following:
        1. Warm up a DFG function.
        2. Sets a breakpoint in a function breakpointBasic() that will be called
           by the DFG function, but has never been called yet.
        3. Call a driver function which in turn calls the DFG function, and expect
           the debugger to break.
        4. At the breakpoint in breakpointBasic(), evaluate an expression on its
           caller i.e. the DFG function, and change a local variable in it.
        5. Resume from the debugger, and let the DFG function and its driver
           function run to completion. The DFG function will return a value
           computed using the modified local.
        6. At the end of the driver function, verify that the returned computed
           value reflects the modified value.

        This test has been verified with tracing enabled to ensure that the test
        DFG function was indeed DFG compiled, and that the test passed with the
        expected results.

        If RenderQuote is a subclass of RenderObject, it can't be split by the first-letter CSS pseudoclass.
        Instead, we should make it a subclass of RenderElement, so that it can be split properly.

        This adds a test to make sure that the splitting behavior occurs, as well as updates existing tests that
        didn't use the splitting behavior.

        The test harness was setting up managers and observers before
        telling the frontend host that the page loaded. The InspectorObserver
        was also not being initialized.

        Subpixel Layout: Align <input type="button", submit etc (PushButtonPart) top and bottom paddings with <button>
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=127640

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        <button> sets padding-top: 2px and padding-bottom: 3px as default values (html.css),
        while <input type="button" (submit, etc) has the hardcoded values of 0, 0 and we center the text using the available space.
        This results in different baseline text position in normal cases. This adjustment puts the <input type='button'
        rendering back to the pre-subpixel layout state.

        Subpixel layout: Default style of input type=checkbox/radio (0.5ex) adds 1px extra margin on both left and right.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125728

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Using the 0.5ex value to set checkbox/radio left and right margins is a long-standing
        (khtml) behavior. While it indicates dynamic behavior, in order to get the margins changed,
        the widget's font size needs to be set, which is rather rare for such input types.
        It also results in odd layout, where the checkbox's indentation may seem to change randomly.

        '<input style="font-size: 30px;" type="checkbox">foo' changes neither the checkbox
        nor the text size, but it indents the line by about 15px.

        Other browsers (FF, Opera with Presto) disagree and they set static margins values.
        2px is the current default computed value.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Remove "Breakpoints Enabled" output in tests. Breakpoints are already
        enabled by default in tests. Also since the DebuggerAgent.enable() call
        now immediately recompiles scripts, sourceParsed events are now sent to
        the frontend earlier even before the setBreakpointsActive message has
        been processed, so the "Breakpoints Enabled" output was showing up
        later, seemingly randomly in tests, and is no longer helpful.

        text-emphasis-position CSS property doesn't recognize 'left' and 'right'
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126611

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        With regards to text-emphasis-position, "left" and "right" are only valid in
        vertical writing modes, and "over" and "under" are only valid in horizontal
        writing modes.

        In order to keep in line with existing pages, specifying "under" without
        "left" or "right" should draw text as if "under left" was specified (and
        vice-versa).

        The default value for text-emphasis-position should be "over right".

        differences. The tests should be redone with squared results
        and blending that leads to stable colors. (Requested by krit_

        Make spelling tests added in r141354 to be able to run asynchronously
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126895

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        As we started running spelling tests asynchronously, invoke 'finishJSTest()'
        when all operations are completed, for example, required spelling markers have appeared.
        It might happen later then during 'initSpellTest'  testing callback.

        Due to the tests perform other checks that do not affect expectation order (selection,
        context menu suggestion items), the asynchronous operations were pushed back to the end of
        the tests to be sure that those won't break expectation order.

        Merge PageVisibilityState & ViewState::IsVisible in WebKit2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126214

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        WebKit2 redundantly tracks the visibility of the view through two mechanisms - the visibility
        state, and the view state. Remove visibility state from the WebKit2 layer. The visibility
        state also tracks the prerender state - so split this out and handle it separately (a change
        we should make in WebCore, too).

        LayoutTests - remove test for notification on visibility state change to preerender. This test
        was covering something nonsensical, and not supported by the spec - the page should never see
        a visibility change to prerender, this should only be an initial state. WebKit2 API now only
        allows the client to change the state to prerender without sending a notification, and there
        is no sense in continuing to support the current test case, since the behaviour is neither
        allowed by API nor available in web content.

        The prerender state is now properly covered by API tests.

        Updated tests and expectations to keep them passing after the
        change done in DRT, without changing their actual purpose.

        * platform/gtk/accessibility/roles-exposed.html: Make sure we
        print "AXRole: (no element)" when accessibilityElementByID() does
        not return a valid object, not to confuse it with cases where the
        returned string for the role is an empty string.
        * platform/gtk/accessibility/roles-exposed-expected.txt: Update
        test expectations to reflect the "AXRole: (no element)" string
        that is now being exposed. Also, replace the (wrongly added) PASS
        expectations with FAIL for rowgroups, which are currently not
        being exposed for ATK either.

        * accessibility/deleting-iframe-destroys-axcache.html: Just
        consider the first and third sons of the accessibility object for
        the body (instead of the grandsons), so the test can run both in
        Mac, where sons and grandsons are exposed, and ATK, where only
        sons are exposed (no StaticText objects exposed there).

        * accessibility/non-data-table-cell-title-ui-element.html: Use
        accessibilityElementById() to get the accessibility object for the
        "skip" table header instead of navigating with childAtIndex(),
        since the hierarchy is not the same for Mac and ATK based ports.

        * platform/mac/accessibility/search-predicate.html: Do not rely on
        shouldBe() together with the string "AXRole: " when asking for the
        role of objects that should no longer be in the accessibility
        tree, and use shouldBeUndefined() instead.
        * platform/mac/accessibility/search-when-element-starts-in-table.html: Ditto.

        CSS property should behave as if it wasn't specified (and the underline is a normal one)

        [ATK] [WK2] platform/gtk/accessibility/roles-exposed.html is failing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125854

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Updated tests and expectations to keep them passing after the
        change done in DRT, without changing their actual purpose.

        * platform/gtk/accessibility/roles-exposed.html: Make sure we
        print "AXRole: (no element)" when accessibilityElementByID() does
        not return a valid object, not to confuse it with cases where the
        returned string for the role is an empty string.
        * platform/gtk/accessibility/roles-exposed-expected.txt: Update
        test expectations to reflect the "AXRole: (no element)" string
        that is now being exposed. Also, replace the (wrongly added) PASS
        expectations with FAIL for rowgroups, which are currently not
        being exposed for ATK either.

        * accessibility/deleting-iframe-destroys-axcache.html: Just
        consider the first and third sons of the accessibility object for
        the body (instead of the grandsons), so the test can run both in
        Mac, where sons and grandsons are exposed, and ATK, where only
        sons are exposed (no StaticText objects exposed there).

        * accessibility/non-data-table-cell-title-ui-element.html: Use
        accessibilityElementById() to get the accessibility object for the
        "skip" table header instead of navigating with childAtIndex(),
        since the hierarchy is not the same for Mac and ATK based ports.

        * accessibility/loading-iframe-updates-axtree.html: Use the new
        web area inside the iframe to compare against the old one, instead
        of doing it the other way around, to avoid calling isEqual for an
        undefined value (the old web area).
        * accessibility/loading-iframe-updates-axtree-expected.txt:
        Removed line comparing the old and new web areas inside the iframe.

        * platform/mac/accessibility/search-predicate.html: Do not rely on
        shouldBe() together with the string "AXRole: " when asking for the
        role of objects that should no longer be in the accessibility
        tree, and use shouldBeUndefined() instead.
        * platform/mac/accessibility/search-when-element-starts-in-table.html: Ditto.

        * platform/mac/accessibility/search-predicate-expected.txt: Update
        expectations according to the usage of shouldBeUndefined().
        * platform/mac/accessibility/search-when-element-starts-in-table-expected.txt: Ditto.

        * platform/mac-wk2/TestExpectations: Add search-when-element-starts-in-table.html
        here, since it does not return an undefined object in WebKit2 when
        the search query should return no results (see bug 125996).

        Specifically, the old behavior was setting the JS type property did not reflect in

        'initial' and 'inherit' are always allowed values for CSS properties.
        As the CSSParser handles them automatically, those 2 values were never

        Layout Test platform/mac/accessibility/search-predicate-element-count.html is flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125195

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Our test checks for AccessibilityObject::isOnscreen which makes sure an element is currently scrolled to a visible
        location onscreen. This test was flaky because sometimes elements we thought would be visible weren't. To resolve
        this I've moved the elements that are tested for visibility to the very top of the document so they have a tiny
        vertical offset and will ALWAYS be visible.

        [CSS Shapes] Layout using [<box> || <shape>] value
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124428

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Adding tests to make sure that shapes properly size and position themselves across box values
        and writing modes. Some shape-outside tests needed to be updated to explicitly size themselves
        to content-box, as they were relying on that being the default value. Some shape-inside tests
        needed to be adjusted as box-sizing no longer affects the shape size and position.

        Rebased some tests due to regions layers changes.
        Updated some tests to increase clarity. Some of them were only passing because two
        regions were close together and the fact that an element was being painted

        Configurability test of prototype's properties in fast/dom/webidl-operations-on-node-prototype.html is wrong
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124602

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The test case landed in r159100 checks, among other tests, for configurability of properties on the Node's
        interface prototype object. The test deletes the tested property from the prototype object and checks that
        the property is undefined. This works for the Node's prototype object but is not technically correct since
        there might be a property with the same identifier that's located upwards on the prototype chain.

        Rather than testing that the property on the prototype object is undefined after it is deleted, a failure
        should be reported if the value of the property remains the same even after it's deleted from the object.

        Modifying RTCIceCandidate object construction to match the spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124369

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        According to the spec the RTCIceCandidateInit parameter in RTCSessionDescription constructor is optional,
        which must not be nullable, and, if passed, must be a valid Dictionary. If the keys are not present, the string
        object that stores them in the RTCIceCandidate class, must be null in those cases. Also, if a key is present
        and its value is not valid an exception must be raised.

        [CSS Regions] Implement visual overflow for first & last regions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118665

        Rebased some tests due to regions layers changes.
        Updated some tests to increase clarity. Some of them were only passing because two
        regions were close together and the fact that an element was being painted
        inside the wrong region was not visible. Floats are now also unsplittable.
                - bottom-overflow-out-of-first-region
                - float-pushed-width-change-2
                - float-pushed-width-change
                - webkit-flow-float-unable-to-push

        Changed top-overflow-out-of-second-region to reftest.

        Added new tests for testing the visual overflow in different situations 
        (transformed, inline, opacity, floating).

        Web Inspector: Crash when closing the Inspector while debugging an exception inside a breakpoint condition.

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Checking that the debugger will not crash nor stall when exceptions are throw while the debugger
        is already paused. The cases when that can happen include breakpoint conditions, actions, eval
        or runtime object inspection.

        The current behavior was to ignore the exceptions or breakpoints while executing "console commands"
        when the debugger was already paused. I'm extending this mechanism to breakpoint conditions and
        actions as the Debugger is not designed to support nested "debugger breaks".

        The simple line layout produces slightly different runs in some pre-wrap cases compared
        to the line box path (with less unnecessary boxes). To keep the test coverage this patch forces the
        existing render tree dump based tests to use line boxes. It also adds new ref tests for
        the same cases where the test uses the simple line path and the ref is forced on the line box path.
        This ensures that the paths produce pixel-identical results.

        [MathML] Poor spacing around delimiters in MathML Torture Test 14
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122837

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Instead of stretching the vertical bar with the stretchable version, just repeat
        the normal vertical bar. This follows what Gecko does when rendering tall vertical
        bars and also works around an issue with STIX fonts leading to poor spacing in
        formulas.

        [GTK] Add new GTK-specific layout test results for vertical text
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124000

        Reviewed by Mario Sanchez Prada.

        Rebaselined some expected results for tests that use vertical text.
        These tests are now working fine after the fix from Bug 50619.
        They have specific results for WebKit2 GTK+ because WebKit1 has a
        permanent area in the bottom for the horizontal scroll bar.
        This area reduces the layout area in WebKit1 and consequently the
        results differ from WebKit2.

        AX: [ATK] Video and audio elements are not properly exposed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123894

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Updated tests and expectations according to the new behavior.

        Updated failing test to reflect the new reality.
        * platform/gtk/accessibility/media-element-expected.txt: Updated.

        Extended GTK specific test by adding an <audio> element besides
        the <video> one and printing all the information about those
        related to their media nature.

        * platform/gtk/accessibility/media-controls-panel-title.html: Extended.
        * platform/gtk/accessibility/media-controls-panel-title-expected.txt: Updated.

        Added new tests for GTK and EFL to check that the replaced
        character is being properly emitter for both <video> and <audio>
        elements. Inspired in the ones in platform/mac, we use a different
        approach here to print the test since we don't have the
        textMarkerRangeForElement functionality in our DRT/WKTR, and
        because we expect embedded objects to show up in the results in a
        GTK/EFL specific way (using the "<obj>" string).

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        From Blink r155555, r155850 and r155889 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>

        Added a couple of new tests to check that both known and unknown
        named grid areas are properly handled.

        Also extended some of the existing tests to use named grid areas
        as any other possible grid position.

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        Updated some of the control labels/roles to improve accessibility.
          - Volume slider is now keyboard/screenreader accessible.
          - muteButton was a checkbox toggling checked state, now a button that toggles label "mute/unmute"
          - fullscreenButton was a checkbox toggling checked state, now a button that toggles label "display/exit full screen"
          - captionButton was a checkbox, now a popup button that launches the newly accessible menu.
        Subtitles menu is now keyboard/screenreader accessible (uses roaming tabindex).
        Render dump expectations changed because volume slider is now hidden via... 
        ...opacity/size (to make accessible without hover) instead of display:none.

        Updated existing test coverage.

        Instead of stretching the vertical bar with the stretchable version, just repeat
        the normal vertical bar. This follows what Gecko does when rendering tall vertical
        bars and also works around an issue with STIX fonts leading to poor spacing in
        formulas.

        Precision errors in Math.cbrt() on GTK, EFL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123624

        Reviewed by Csaba Osztrogonác.

        Calculate cube roots of 8 and -8, expecting 2 and -2, respectively. Cube roots of those two
        numbers don't contain precision errors on the GTK and EFL ports as is the case with 27 and -27.

        [EFL][WK1] Some tests of editing/selection fail to render properly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117574

        Unreviewed, EFL gardening.

        These tests are passed in wk1(and wk2), but skipped in wk1.
        These tests have been reviewed since those are added.
        Now these tests are operating properly, so those need to update the test expectations.
        Also 'editing/selection/caret-and-focus-ring.html' is already changed a reason of failure by Bug no.123696

        with instructions to the WebProcess to create the WebPage. The initial creation state of
        the WebPage is communicated to the WebProcess via two routes (firstly an asynchronous
        WebProcess::CreateWebPage message, and secondly in the synchronous response from
        WebPageProxy::createNewPage). Unfortunately these responses are inconsistent with each
        other. The creationParameters() for the page are calculated twice, and since the WKView
        will be added to a window between the async message being sent and the synchronous reply
        being returned the visibility state of the page can change.

        To fix the inconsistency we can set the creation parameters at the point that the
        WebPageProxy is instantiated. This will result in a functional change that is web
        visible, since the page will initially be opened in a hidden/blurred state, and may
        later become visible/focussed. This change is consistent with the direction we want to
        evolve in. Whilst we will still probably require a synchronous message from the
        WebProcess to the UIProcess on Window.open, we'll probably make this return much earlier
        – having just created the WebPageProxy, but avoiding blocking the WebProcess over the
        client delegate callback that opens the new window.

        This fix results in a layout test result change, due to the change in behavior (page is
        created blurred, and becomes focussed, resulting in a focus event being fired – rather
        than the window opening directly into a focussed state). This is reported as a
        progression (test is broken in WebKit1, fixed in WebKit2 after this change). In reality
        the test is actually slightly broken in DRT/test-runner – the test runs differently than
        in browser, since there is is no visible main window. In-browser this patch results in
        no change in behavior on dom/Window/mozilla-focus-blur.html (the affected test).

        not be encountered when manipulating the MathML document via

        Each 'Internals' instance is associated with a 'Document'. So, it
        is not necessary to pass a document as argument. Only nodesFromRect and

        [CSS Regions] Rename CSS classes and JS methods in vertical layout tests about selection

        Revert <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/157893>
        (Mavericks test results mega-patch).

        It didn't fix Mavericks, which still has dozens of failures, and it broke Mountain
        Lion bots, which need to remain green for tools like EWS to work.

        At a glance, there are multiple systemic issues with this change:
        - some results went to broken locations like platform/mac/platform/mac/editing/spelling/autocorrection-at-beginning-of-word-1-expected.png;
        - WK2 expectations also went to platform/mac/platform/mac-wk2/TestExpectations.
        - some tests like js/dom/global-constructors-attributes.html used to match cross-platform
        baseline, but copying Mavericks results over to platform/mac made it so that those results
        are now ignored on Mountain Lion.

        I think that starting over will be easier that fixing these issues incrementally.

        Created a pixel new test where taking this gap width into account when

        2. Same as 1, for radial gradients. (This doesn't happen in practice as

        Add support for the column-fill property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117693

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        With column-fill support, a lot of multicol tests needed an update.
        The old implementation behaved as if column-fill were 'auto', but the
        initial value is 'balance', so now we need to be explicit about that.
        For auto-height tests it doesn't really matter - such multicols are always
        balanced anyway.
