        Add initial layout testing coverage for timer throttling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138809

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Add initial layout test coverage for timer throttling. It currently
        covers the following cases:
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Repeating timer doing DOM mutations
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Nested timer doing DOM mutations

        More layout tests are coming. In particular, we should add coverage for
        changing the style of an Element outside the viewport. We should also
        Test that the timer gets unthrottled if necessary on scrolling / layout.

        Some of the tests use the prefixed interface name. Replace that
        with the unprefixed version.

        The "keyframes-rule.html" test added a check to make sure the
        old constant WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE is the same as the new
        constant KEYFRAMES_RULE.

        [Media] Timeline scrubber not updating as the video plays
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138717
        <rdar://problem/18957509>

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        Tests that an inline video will actually advance the
        timeline scrubber if it plays momentarily.

        Eric wrote all the hard bits here. I just changed
        a few lines to test if the timeline had moved from 0.
        Unfortunately we can't rely on the timeline value
        being identical to the currentTime of the media element,
        because we only move the timeline when we get events.

        test. The reason why it was moved there is because the test would
        require huge (~1000000 tracks) grid allocations, making the test
        quite slow specially on Debug builds.

        The JIT should cache property lookup misses.
        <https://webkit.org/b/135578>

        Add a JSRegress test for caching of property lookup misses.
        There are three subtests:

            1. Pure speed test.
            2. Test for when a property previously cached as missing suddenly
               appears on the object.
            3. Same as (2), but it appears on the prototype.

        The test runs ~5.5x faster with the optimization.

        Give pseudo elements the correct specificity
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138378

        * fast/css/pseudo-element-specificity.html: Added.
        Given that all selector affecting the pseudo element were offset by one,
        it is impossible to use a pseudo element directly to affect the order, making the bug
        hard to test.

        What I did here for testing is use the stauration at 255 of any specificity field.
        With 255 class + 1 pseudo element, the old code would saturate at (0, 255, 0), while
        the fixed code would correctly give (0, 255, 1). By comparing that to a non-saturated
        selector, I can show the fix is correct.

        Update jquery's qunit config to not refresh the test results
        regularly as this is not useful as part of layout testing.

        This was causing qunit to set a timer every 13ms to check if
        results should be updated and this timer would sometimes get
        throttled after r175441.

        CSS4 Selectors: Add the pseudo class :any-link
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138128

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Story time: I implement only half of the patch and run
        fast/selectors/webkit-any-link.html to make sure it fails...
        and the test happily PASS.

        I look into it and sure enough, a last minute change in
        html-link-type-tests.js made it test nothing but :link.

        I update html-link-type-tests.js to actually test the desired selector,
        run the test again: PASS.

        I debug a bit and I find why my code is not tested: html-link-type-tests.js
        uses Element.matches() and that does not use the CSS JIT.

        Fair enough, I add a querySelectorAll("#target' + selector + '") to run
        through the JIT: PASS.

        Since that selector is simple-#id + simple selector, we go through a fast
        path for ids and skip the JIT. Arrrrg!

        Finally, I added querySelectorAll(".target' + selector + '"), which covers
        the CSS JIT.

        The nice thing is: all those cases are tested now :)

        can mark it as passing there too. Tracked as bug 105616.

        Prior to Yosemite results landing, this test was marked as failing on WK2, and its
        results matched WK1. It got changed several times during the merge, so it ended
        up being marked as failing on WK1, but with WK1 results landed.

        Let's land WK2 results and keep testing on WK2. Also, Mavericks results were no different

        Clamp wordSpacing percentage value.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129350.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Make sure that setting the CSS style wordSpacing property to very huge percentage
        value and blending this value with other values for animating key frames does
        not assert or crash. The expectation is to have this huge value to be clamped to
        the pre-defined min/max values for the CSS length type. So when blending the clamped
        value with other wordSpacing values, the result can't be NaN. This should be very
        similar to the case when it is set to a huge <length> value.

        SVG loaded through html <img> can't request to load any external resources.

        Also ensure the same rule is enforced on cached resources.

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        I made this test while working on an optimization, and it seems useful
        to have in the tree since it adds additional coverage. The optimization
        may come later.

        The test works by creating little DOM subtrees like so:

            <foo><bar>some text</bar></foo>

        It then overwrites that subtree with an identical one by mutating the
        containing element's innerHTML property. It then verifies that the DOM
        structure is correct and that Node wrappers retain any custom properties
        set on them.

        RenderMathMLUnderOver adds spacing to the child operator indefinitely when resizing the window.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Change the layout with resize test of the MathML underover object from being render tree test
        to be reference test. The render test was failing on WK2 because it was doing window resizing 
        and view zooming.  The new test rely solely on forcing the layout synchronously by resizing the
        math container <div> element.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler, Daniel Bates.

        When the alignment is center, which is the common case for math, changing the size of
        an object affects the position of this object also.  We need to confirm that zooming or
        resizing the window should not affect the rectangle of the over/under math object operator.

        New test with many under and over math objects.  After loading the page, the window is resized and

        * platform/mac/mathml/opentype/opentype-stretchy-horizontal-expected.txt:
        This test was wrong because of the spacing issue. The page has two <mover> math objects at the beginning.
        Each of them has an <mspace> child. The width of the first <mspace> is 1em while the width of the second
        <mspace> is 2em. The font size is 10pt. So it is expected to have the first one 10 pixels and the second 
        to be 20 pixels. In the test, the width of the first is 22 and the width of the second is 32.
        I do expect this test to fail on other platforms since they have the same mistake which is now fixed. I am
        going to submit the mac expected version only and when it fails I am going to collect the result and submit
        another patch for the other platforms expected files.

        Add the baseline implementation of :not(selectorList)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137548

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        There are 3 big kind of changes to the tests:
        1) The new implementation intentionally breaks :not() of :visited and :link.
           Some test for the basic :not(:link) and :not(:visited) are consequently failing.
        2) Some tests were ensuring that :not() only support simple selectors, those are
           becoming irrelevant.
        3) New test for the feature.

        * TestExpectations:
        This patch intentionally breaks :not(:link). The test fast/history/link-inside-not.html
