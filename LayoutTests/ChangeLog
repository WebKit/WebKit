        [CSS Grid Layout] Prevent issues with checkLayout() in grid items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130770

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        When we use checkLayout() on a grid item, the results (PASS or FAIL
        messages) are added as new auto-placed items in the grid. Which might
        cause some unexpected behavior in the tests.

        This patch modifies the related layout tests to use a different
        container (usually the parent node of the grid) for the test results.
        Avoiding any kind of interference with the grid code.

        InlineIterator position (unsigned int) variable can wrap around
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130540

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This test triggers an ASSERT that occurs when we are ignoring spaces (to collapse them
        into a single whitespace mark) but then encounter a line break. Because we don't ignore
        the first space (but do ignore subsequent spaces), when we hit a newline in an RTL context
        we want to ignore that first space as well (so as not to push the text away from the right
        edge). We do this by decrementing the InlineIterator pointing to this first space, so all
        the spaces get ignored. However, if that space is the first character in a Text node, the
        decrement will try to go past the beginning of the node, and trigger an ASSERT.

        This design is not great. At some point we should rework it to more elegantly handle
        collapsing whitespace in both RTL and LTR writing modes.

        Subpixel rendering: RenderBox is positioned off by one when non-compositing transform is present.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130430

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        div {
            position: absolute;
             top: 10.25px;
             left: 10.25px;
         }

         The <div> with (10.25px, 10.25px) is painted to (10.5px, 10.5px) after device pixel snapping on 2x display.
         Moving <div> to its own RenderLayer should not change the painting position.

         div {
             position: absolute;
             top: 10.25px;
             left: 10.25px;
             -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);
         }

        When we paint the RenderLayer's content, the graphics context is translated by the rounded value of
        renderer's offset from parent.

            (10.25px,10.25px) -> rounded to (10.5px,10.5px).

        When the translate moves the graphics context's origin over the renderer's top-left position,
        the renderer's relative top-left coordinates end up being negative.

            Graphics context translated by (10.5px,10.5px) -> pushes renderer's relative top-left coords to (-0.25px,-0.25px)

        When we round (pixel snap) these negative coordinates, half-way values get translated to the wrong direction.

        (relative coords (-0.25px,-0.25px) -> pixel snapped to (-0.5px,-0.5px) -> final absolute(painting) coords (10px,10px))

        This patch changes the rounding to flooring to ensure that the relative top-left position never gets negative as the result
        of subpixel shifting.

        Web Inspector: add frontend controller and models for replay sessions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130145

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Add tests for existing nondeterministic inputs handled in JSC.
        They are skipped for all platforms until WEB_REPLAY is enabled.

        The new mechanism here is the single-segment replay reftest. It will
        load the test page once to inject test code into the inspector. Then,
        the reftest will reload the test page and start capturing. The test
        page performs some nondeterministic computation before the load event.
        Then, the inspector test dumps the computed nondeterministic state.
        Capturing is stopped, and the session is replayed once. When the load
        event fires on the replayed page execution, the nondeterministic states
        from capturing and replaying are compared. They should be the same.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Rounded rectangle's radius needs adjustment after its containing rect gets pixel snapped.
        Keeping the old radius value could make rounded rectangle non-renderable, because the
        originally calculated radius length does not fit the snapped rectangle anymore.

        Subpixel rendering: Nested layers with subpixel accumulation paint to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.
        
        Compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> floored painting position (0, 0)
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2), 
        but the actual painting offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of parent flooring.
        
        Non-compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> GraphicsContext is translated to (0, 0).
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2)
        but the GraphicsContext's offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of the parent's translate.   

        In both cases, without the subpixel adjustment, we'd paint the current layer at (10.0, 10.0)
        after flooring, while its painting position is actually (10.5, 10.5).
        Subpixels do accumulate through nested layers.

        Change scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() to do LayoutUnit math
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129981

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() returned an IntSize,
        but to allow subpixel scroll offsets, we need it to return a LayoutSize.

        Update test results for the progression.

        Reduce memory use for static property maps
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129986

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Static property tables are currently duplicated on first use from read-only memory into dirty memory
        in every process, and since the entries are large (48 bytes) and the tables can be unusually sparse
        (we use a custom hash table without a rehash) a lot of memory may be wasted.

        The rendering of mo-stretch has changed after the recent improvements
        to the <mo> element. This updates the reference for the GTK port.

        [CSS Shapes] Remove deprecated shapes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125235

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Remove tests for deprecated shape syntax.

        There are also a few shape-inside tests that have been removed because
        they were very difficult to make work without the rectangle shape, and
        the future of the current shape-inside implementation is questionable
        at best.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that both the simple and non-simple cases paint to the same position.
        Simple compositing container layer codepath needs to take the fractional device pixel offset
        into account when painting. Without the fractional value, the final paint rounding could push the
        paint offset to a different position.
        retina example:
        compositing top-left: 0px 0px.
        fractional offset: 0.3px 0.3px
        painting coords without offseting: 0px 0px

        https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?revision=168160&view=revision

            The root cause is CompositeEditCommand::moveParagraphWithClones() passing
            two positions |start| and |end| which do not follow the document order,
            i.e. in some situations |start| is located after |end| because of
            the difference in affinity.

            This patch fixes this crash by normalizing |end| to |start| in such situations.
            It also adds an ASSERT that checks the relationship between |start| and |end|.

        outlineBoundsForRepaint() is expected to return the outline repaint rect. Using enclosingIntRect()
        to calculate the outline boundaries breaks repaint logic in RenderElement::repaintAfterLayoutIfNeeded().
        Since enclosingIntRect() can return bigger rect than repaint rect, the old/new bounds' dimensions could end up
        being different which triggers the size change repaint code path.

        This test renders large text with a double underline, but then barely clips off the bottom underline
        using overflow: hidden. It makes sure that this is exactly the same as a single underline. If the
        space between the two underlines does not scale with font size, it will appear as though there is a
        single thick underline (because they will be drawn on top of each other) and will thus fail this test.

        Ensure keySplines is valid in SMIL animations

        Merged from Blink (patch by Philip Rogers):
        https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?revision=156452&view=revision
        http://crbug.com/276111

            This patch fixes a crash in SMIL animations when keySplines are not
            specified. The SMIL spec is clear on this:
            http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncCalcMode
            "If there are any errors in the keyTimes specification (bad values,
            too many or too few values), the animation will have no effect."

            This patch simply checks that keyTimes is not empty. Previously,
            splinesCount was set to be m_keySplines.size() + 1 in
            SVGAnimationElement.cpp; this patch changes splinesCount to be equal
            to m_keySplines.size() to make the logic easier to follow and to
            match other checks in SVGAnimationElement::startedActiveInterval.

        Filters should test for area instead of single dimension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123716

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        A filtered SVG element with a sigle dimension bigger than 5000
        (counting the margin/border) will fail to render. So an element
        with 4000x4000 will render fine, while another with 5000x10
        won't. This patch instead tests against the total element area,
        which fixes such cases.

        The current patch fixes the rendering issue and at same time,
        fixes some layer violations where FilterEffectRenderer and
        RenderSVGResourceFilter were directly accessing the kMax value
        in FilterEffect. Since before a somewhat bigger filter would
        be aborted, it required to change the maximum kernel size
        for blur filter (some filters are slower to run than others for
        bigger SVGs).

        Underlines are too thick when zoomed in
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129352

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This test changes the page scale factor to a very large value, simulating
        the user zooming in with a trackpad. It then positions the viewport
        to a place where the underline should not be drawn. It then compares this
        to a completely white page.

        This explanation cannot be in the test itself because the test sets the
        scale factor too high for the tester to be able to read text.

        Move http/tests/inspector/ to inspector-obsolete/http-tests/.
        Fold http/tests/inspector-enabled/ into inspector-obsolete/http-tests/.

        I have elided about 1100 lines of rename Changelog spew;
        no filenames have been altered in this reorganization.

        Remove mentions of obsolete tests from TestExpectations. Remove skips
        for inspector-obsolete/ from port-specific expectations, and just
        put it in the generic expectations file.

        Remove inspector-protocol/heap-profiler tests, as they are obsolete.

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Remove many tests that were specific to the old inspector user interface.
        These cannot be ported either because they were specific to the UI, or
        they test features that no longer exist in the Web Inspector.

        The test col-and-colgroup-offsets.html is failing on the Apple Win Debug (Tests) bot due
        to platform-specific numeric differences in the computed offsetHeight of the table cells.
        For now, I am landing Windows-specific expected results as the behavior tested by the test
        is correct despite the numerical differences. I'll further investigate the Window-specific
        difference in <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129179>.

        Add tests for regions in multi-column elements and a test that verifies
        regions are correctly clipped by their containers when both have hidden
        overflow.
        For the non horizontal-tb writing modes tests there's no overflow after the
        last region because it's not rendered correctly yet in a new column.

        The spec defines the mix-blend-mode property. This means that the

        Rename EXT_draw_buffers to WEBGL_draw_buffers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128894

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        webgl-draw-buffers.html came from Khronos's webgl conformace tests. It requires
        some new apis in webgl-test-utils.js so that it is updated as well. The attached
        test results are for mac. But they're expected to fail since EXT_draw_buffers are
        disabled with some reason. See WebGLDrawBuffers::supported. So I add a line
        for webgl-draw-buffers.html to mac/TestExpectations.
