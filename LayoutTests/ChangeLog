        These scripts were not "slow" at all - 100 microseconds is nothing. Furthermore,
        slow-loading-sheet-in-error.php wasn't even used, because of a typo in the test.
        And worst of all, WebCore has its own ideas about when to load stylesheets - notably,
        default stylesheet loading blocks script execution, so we cannot do anything before
        the stylesheet loads.

        Continuously repainting large parts of Huffington Post.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139468

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch eliminates redundant repaint requests for inlines when neither the parent
        block flow nor any of the inline children are dirty.
        Previously,
        1. simple line layout always recalculated inline content positions regardless of whether
        the content needed relayout at all; as a result, it always triggered full repaint.
        2. inline tree layout ignored the needslayout flag on the last line and treated it dirty
        (unless it broke cleanly (<div>foo<br></div>)).
        This was an ancient workaround for an editing/insert use case, but it seems not to be the case anymore.

        rdar://problem/19050653

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        In certain cases, when block flow needs to compute the preferred width of a particular text
        renderer, we use the non-simple line layout text measuring.
        However, the same text renderer might end up at simple line layout later.
        Complex line layout measures text including the trailing space and it subtracts
        (the constant value of) space width afterwards, while simple line layout measures
        runs without the extra space.
        In such cases, this may result different word widths and produce unexpected line breaking. (preferred width != final width)
        In long term, any text renderer qualified for simple line layout should go through the simple
        text measuring code path. (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138973)
        For now, just copy complex line layout behaviour. This also matches the previous simple line layout line breaking implementation.

        Add initial layout testing coverage for timer throttling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138809

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Add initial layout test coverage for timer throttling. It currently
        covers the following cases:
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Repeating timer doing DOM mutations
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Nested timer doing DOM mutations

        More layout tests are coming. In particular, we should add coverage for
        changing the style of an Element outside the viewport. We should also
        Test that the timer gets unthrottled if necessary on scrolling / layout.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Add a test case to make sure we don't crash when parsing an <input>
        Element that has a |border| attribute as first attribute. This is what
        was happening with the first version of this patch that landed in
        r175852. When attributeChanged() was called for the |border| attribute
        HTMLInputElement::isPresentationAttribute() would get called before
        m_inputType is initialized, and "name == borderAttr && isImageButton()"
        would crash because isImageButton() dereferences m_inputType.

        in writePositionAndStyle() to get the object rectangle so this issue only affects test output.

        The JIT should cache property lookup misses.
        <https://webkit.org/b/135578>

        Add a JSRegress test for caching of property lookup misses.
        There are three subtests:

            1. Pure speed test.
            2. Test for when a property previously cached as missing suddenly
               appears on the object.
            3. Same as (2), but it appears on the prototype.

        The test runs ~5.5x faster with the optimization.

        Give pseudo elements the correct specificity
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138378

        * fast/css/pseudo-element-specificity.html: Added.
        Given that all selector affecting the pseudo element were offset by one,
        it is impossible to use a pseudo element directly to affect the order, making the bug
        hard to test.

        What I did here for testing is use the stauration at 255 of any specificity field.
        With 255 class + 1 pseudo element, the old code would saturate at (0, 255, 0), while
        the fixed code would correctly give (0, 255, 1). By comparing that to a non-saturated
        selector, I can show the fix is correct.

        Test that :not() itself does not influence the specificity,
        only the nested selectors contribute to the global specificity.

        Those tests come from blink. Rune solved the same problem a year ago on blink
        in https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/23710067
        The patch is quite different because blink uses an ancient code base, but the tests
        can still be useful so I included them here.

        Ensure the CSS un-prefixed column properties are behaving the same way as the
        prefixed ones. The CSS prefixed column properties are still supported by making
        them aliases of the un-prefixed ones.  Also port some of the W3C and Mozilla
        tests for css column properties tests.

        Change to the un-prefixed column names to be compared with the return of CSSStyleDeclaration.item().

        blending two Length values of different types. And these two Length values
        are defined in two consecutive css animation key frames.

        CSS4 Selectors: Add the pseudo class :any-link
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138128

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Story time: I implement only half of the patch and run
        fast/selectors/webkit-any-link.html to make sure it fails...
        and the test happily PASS.

        I look into it and sure enough, a last minute change in
        html-link-type-tests.js made it test nothing but :link.

        I update html-link-type-tests.js to actually test the desired selector,
        run the test again: PASS.

        I debug a bit and I find why my code is not tested: html-link-type-tests.js
        uses Element.matches() and that does not use the CSS JIT.

        Fair enough, I add a querySelectorAll("#target' + selector + '") to run
        through the JIT: PASS.

        Since that selector is simple-#id + simple selector, we go through a fast
        path for ids and skip the JIT. Arrrrg!

        Finally, I added querySelectorAll(".target' + selector + '"), which covers
        the CSS JIT.

        The nice thing is: all those cases are tested now :)

        Update Yosemite results for platform/mac/editing/spelling/delete-autocorrected-word-2.html.

        Looks like this got confused during Yosemite tests landing.

        This test is currently marked as failing on WK2, but it passed for me, so maybe we
        can mark it as passing there too. Tracked as bug 105616.

        Prior to Yosemite results landing, this test was marked as failing on WK2, and its
        results matched WK1. It got changed several times during the merge, so it ended
        up being marked as failing on WK1, but with WK1 results landed.

        Let's land WK2 results and keep testing on WK2. Also, Mavericks results were no different
        from Yosemite.

        Clamp wordSpacing percentage value.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129350.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Make sure that setting the CSS style wordSpacing property to very huge percentage
        value and blending this value with other values for animating key frames does
        not assert or crash. The expectation is to have this huge value to be clamped to
        the pre-defined min/max values for the CSS length type. So when blending the clamped
        value with other wordSpacing values, the result can't be NaN. This should be very
        similar to the case when it is set to a huge <length> value.

        SVG loaded through html <img> can't request to load any external resources.

        Add test for innerHTML mutations that yield identical DOM.

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        I made this test while working on an optimization, and it seems useful
        to have in the tree since it adds additional coverage. The optimization
        may come later.

        The test works by creating little DOM subtrees like so:

            <foo><bar>some text</bar></foo>

        It then overwrites that subtree with an identical one by mutating the
        containing element's innerHTML property. It then verifies that the DOM
        structure is correct and that Node wrappers retain any custom properties
        set on them.

        When the alignment is center, which is the common case for math, changing the size of
        an object affects the position of this object also.  We need to confirm that zooming or

        * platform/mac/mathml/opentype/opentype-stretchy-horizontal-expected.txt:
        This test was wrong because of the spacing issue. The page has two <mover> math objects at the beginning.
        Each of them has an <mspace> child. The width of the first <mspace> is 1em while the width of the second
        <mspace> is 2em. The font size is 10pt. So it is expected to have the first one 10 pixels and the second 
        to be 20 pixels. In the test, the width of the first is 22 and the width of the second is 32.
        I do expect this test to fail on other platforms since they have the same mistake which is now fixed. I am
        going to submit the mac expected version only and when it fails I am going to collect the result and submit
        another patch for the other platforms expected files.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        There are 3 big kind of changes to the tests:
        1) The new implementation intentionally breaks :not() of :visited and :link.
           Some test for the basic :not(:link) and :not(:visited) are consequently failing.
        2) Some tests were ensuring that :not() only support simple selectors, those are
           becoming irrelevant.
        3) New test for the feature.

        Inline ruby does not get justified correctly

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        Test that ruby gets spaces inside the ruby base, and that hit testing the
        ruby base gives us correct answers.

        * platform/mac/fast/ruby/bopomofo-rl-expected.txt: Ruby text gets the CSS
        property text-align: justify, which worked prior to this patch. However, this
        patch now justifies ruby bases, so now if there is text that is both a ruby
        base and ruby text (such as ruby in ruby) it correctly gets justified. This
        test does such, and therefore needs to be rebaselined.
