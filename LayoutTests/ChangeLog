        Rebasing expectation as memory cache revalidation is no longer needed now that the disk cache is updating the response passed to the memory cache.
        The disk cache is doing revalidation on the second load. It receives the updated response with longer validity.
        As the extended validity response is now passed to the memory cache, the memory cache revalidation no longer happens.

        [mac-wk1] LayoutTest http/tests/security/cached-cross-origin-preloading-css-stylesheet.html is a flaky failure
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162791

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Flackiness was due to one preload sometimes arriving after the test was finished.
        This causes the issue of not having the preload actually being checked against CORS and the console error was not displayed.
        Making the test wait 1 second after all loads finish to ensure the preload will also finishes.

        Cleaning the test and improving it by:
        - making each load to take 1 second (so that preload is not finished when actual load happens
        - adding some comments explaining each subtest
        - printing DONE at the end of all loads.

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        This test became flaky after r201474 when we started to delay showing
        the inline placeholder until we are sure the video layer has been moved
        into the video fullscreen layer. This means we can't guarantee that the
        placeholder is visible right away after the video's presentation mode
        changes to "picture-in-picture".

        To fix this, wait for the placeholder to become visible before clicking it.
