        * fast/forms/color/input-color-onchange-event.html: Removed unneeded test of how the
        internals object handles incorrect values passed to the test function. This wasn't testing
        actual WebKit code at all, it was just a test of the internals object implementation.

        CSP: Ignore report-only policy delivered via meta element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156565

        Add new test LayoutTests/http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/1.1/reportonly-in-meta-ignored2.html
        to ensure that we ignore X-WebKit-CSP-Report-Only when delivered via a meta element.

        Rename test report-multiple-violations-0{1, 2}.html and eval-allowed-in-report-only-mode-and-sends-report.html
        to report-multiple-violations-0{1, 2}.php and eval-allowed-in-report-only-mode-and-sends-report.php, respectively,
        so that we can make use of PHP to deliver the report-only policy via an HTTP header instead of via a meta element
        as the latter is no longer supported. Additionally, fix up code style in some tests to make them more
        consistent with the code style we use for tests.

        * TestExpectations: Update some entries due to renaming and mark tests reportonly-in-meta-ignored.html
        and reportonly-in-meta-ignored2.html as PASS so that we run them.

        unless otherwise specified by text-align-last, the last line before
        a forced break or the end of the block is start-aligned.

        1. Float boxes are always attached to the line where we see them first.
        2. Float box can only be attached to one line.
        3. RenderBlockFlow can perform partial layout on dirty lines only.

        In certain cases, the last dirty line can "pull up" float boxes from the first clean line.
        It simply means that due to some layout changes on previous lines now we see those floats on this last dirty line first.
        If after placing the float we still find it on the same position, the line below is still considered clean.

        Remove the float box from its original line if the line above already placed it.

            - This test case was changed to prepend a null character to the actual status line. Previously it used a WebSockets frame with a prepended null before the status line. The Python WebSockets lib uses non-ASCII characters in that frame which meant the test case hit the non-ASCII check before the null check. It was confusing to me that the description and intent of the test was to run with a null in the status line, not in a frame before the status line. I believe the changed test case better reflects the intention of the test.

        CSP: Implement frame-ancestors directive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154345
        <rdar://problem/24702161>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Adds new tests to ensure we ignore directive frame-ancestors when defined a policy delivered
        in an HTML meta element or in a report-only policy (i.e. delivered via HTTP header Content-
        Security-Policy-Report-Only). Also adds new test to ensure that we send a violation report
        when the directive frame-ancestors is violated.

        Updated many existing tests and test results that unnecessarily depended on a DOM SecurityError
        exception being thrown when accessing the content of a cross-origin frame. It is sufficient
        and more direct to test directive frame-ancestors by dumping the contents of all children frames
        on the page. We design the tests such that a child frame that was blocked by the frame-ancestors
        directive is expected to have no content. A child frame that was allowed by the frame-ancestors
        directive is expected to have content.

        * TestExpectations: Mark frame-ancestors tests as PASS so that we run them.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Made a little test that loads an image into an <iframe> 10 times and then
        triggers a garbage collection and checks that all the documents got destroyed.

        Prior to this change, all 10 ImageDocuments would remain alive at the end.

        This got rolled out the first time because it failed on bots. It failed due
        to expecting a specific number of documents to be live at the start of the
        test, which was not reliable on bots since we appear to have more leaks(!)

        Tweaked the test to check the delta in live document count instead.

        [css-grid] Add missing test for grid-template shorthand
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155013

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        We support the following syntax in grid-template shorthand:
            -webkit-grid-template: [foo1] 'a' 50px [foo2]
                                   [bar1] 'b' 50px [bar2] / 100px;

        But we don't have a test to check that grid-template-rows value
        has the names of the same lines grouped. So it's:
            [foo1] 50px [foo2 bar1] 50px [bar2];

        This means that if we remove the third argument in
        CSSParser::parseGridLineNames(), all the current tests are passing.

        Without that argument, the value for grid-template-rows would be:
            [foo1] 50px [foo2] [bar1] 50px [bar2];

        Which is wrong.

        This patch adds a specific test case for this which would fail
        in that case.

        [CSS Box Alignment] New CSS Value 'normal' for Content Alignment
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154282

        The Box Alignment specification defines a new value 'normal' to be used
        as default for the different layout models, which will define the
        specific behavior for each case. This patch adds a new CSS value in the
        parsing logic and adapts the Content Alignment properties to the new
        value.

        Since the 'normal' vlaue, initial/default for both justify-content
        and align-content CSS properties, behaves now as 'stretch' instead
        of o'start' we have to rebaseline those tests affected by the new
        default value.

        Add a test. The non-standard element is necessary because the resolved property
        cache is already disabled when using the "simple" default style sheet, and
        it seems better to use a totally non-standard element than one that might
        end up in the "simple" default style sheet in the future and would silently
        invalidate the test.

        Adjust the cancel button position using the actual size of the cancel button.

        When the input box and the font height trigger different cancel button sizes, we need to readjust
        the rectangle returned by cancelButtonRectForBounds.
        This fixes both the mispositioned cancel button and the squared off icon when the input field is zoomed all the way in.

        The original test was wrong. It had the following definition:
            "<g id='symbol'><symbol>...</symbol></g>"
        And it was expecting to have the symbol drawn if the <g> element was
        referenced like that
            "<use xlink:href='#symbol'/>"
        FireFox does not render anything for this <use> element which is correct.
        With this patch, this test failed so it had to be modified to test the right
        behavior. Also it is now converted to a ref test.

        REGRESSION (188611): Search field Cancel button should not overlap search text on extensions page.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154692

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Adjust the cancel button position using the actual size of the cancel button.

        When the input box and the font height trigger different cancel button sizes, we need to readjust
        the rectangle returned by cancelButtonRectForBounds.
        This fixes both the mispositioned cancel button and the squared off icon when the input field is zoomed all the way in.

        Covered by existing tests.

        Background of an absolutely positioned inline element inside text-indented parent is positioned statically.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154019

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that statically positioned out-of-flow renderers are also text-aligned
        even when none of the renderers on the first line generate a linebox (so we end up with no bidi runs at all).
        The fix is to pass IndentTextOrNot information to startAlignedOffsetForLine through updateStaticInlinePositionForChild
        so that we can compute the left position for this statically positioned out of flow renderer.

        You can omit the size of the rows in grid-template shorthand,
        even if you specify a named grid line for the end of the row,
        due to a change in the spec back in 2014:
        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/commit/9f660c4183c73c1f5279c46904dc6cb314f76194

        Before if you want to specify a named grid line,
        you need to set the row size.

        Update parsing, so it nows accepts things like:
            grid-template: 100px / "a" [bottom];

        Make HTMLSelectElement.size behave as per the specification
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154504

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Update test that was covering the case of an HTMLSelectElement with an
        invalid size attribute. The test was expecting the bad "size" attribute
        value to get corrected so that the select element looks like a menu list.
        This workaround was added back in 2007 to workaround a bug on
        www.chainreaction.com (rdar://problem/4697438). This patch drops the
        workaround in HTMLSelectElement::parseAttribute() because:
        1. This is not standard behavior as per the HTML specification
        2. This behavior does not match Firefox either
        3. The workaround is no longer needed for www.chainreaction.com.

        CSP: sandbox directive should be ignored when contained in a policy defined via a meta element

        This patch handles the case when the character at the breaking position does not fit the

        (foo&shy;bar where b overflows the line).
        In such cases we don't yet have an item in the breaking history so we need to take a look at

        Reviewed by Gavin Barraclough.

        * http/tests/security/cross-frame-access-put-expected.txt:
        Rebaseline. The extra security warnings are for the following properties:
        closed, crypto, frameElement, pageXOffset and pageYOffset.
        All these properties are read-only and therefore cannot be set (cross-origin
        or not). The previous code was not doing an explicit check and ended up
        trying to set these properties. However, since they are read-only, we would
        silently fail to set them. The new code does the explicit check and therefore
        will warn and NOT attempt to set.

        [ARMv7] Some JSC test fails due to exhausting the JIT code heap on the no LLINT test configuration.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151611

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        These tests are only failing because they are compiling too much with the LLINT
        disabled.  As a result, they are using more JIT code heap space than is allowed
        by the OS.

        This patch excludes these tests from the noLLINT configuration on 32-bit ARM.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Add test http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/blob-url-matches-source-blob.html to ensure that a
        blob URL matches source "blob:".

        Replaced text-only test http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/blob-urls-match-self.html with an
        analogous reference test http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/blob-url-does-not-match-source-self.html
        so as ensure that we do not regress the behavior that source 'self' should not match a blob URL
        without considering the Content Security Policy violation message as part of the expected result.
        The Content Security Policy violation message will differ between test runs because it references
        the blob URL that triggered the violation, which is cryptographically random.

        * TestExpectations: Remove entry for test http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/blob-urls-match-self.html as the analogous test

        Update test so it no longer expects window.Node to be shadowable. As per
        the specification, the "Node" property is on the window instance, not its

        something actually overwites the previous value, given that the property
        is writable as per:

        Outline does not clip when ancestor has overflow: hidden and requires layer.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153901

        Now that outline is part of visual overflow, we no longer need the special outline cliprect.
        PaintPhaseChildOutlines drawing will switch to foreground cliprect. It ensures proper overflow clipping
        at parent level. PaintPhaseSelfOutline drawing will start using the visual overflow inflated background cliprect.
        With this change, outline will be using the same cliprects as the other visual overflow properties (box-shadow etc).

        Outline should contribute to visual overflow.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153299

        This patch eliminates the special outline handling (RenderView::setMaximalOutlineSize).
        Now that outline is part of visual overflow, we don't have to inflate the layers to accomodate
        outline borders.
        This patch fixes several focusring related repaint issues. However when both the outline: auto
        and the descendant renderer are composited, we still don't paint properly in certain cases. -not a regression.
        (Also when parent renderer has overflow: hidden repaint does not take outline into account. -regression.)
        It changes column behavior (see TestExpectations) since outline behaves now like any other visual overflow properties.

        Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() does not work on sub-frame's window

        Add test case to test calling Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() on a

        - Update test use use an iframe instead of opening a Window for convenience.
        - Use an actual cross-origin URL. The previous URL was same-origin and therefore
          the test would have failed if window.location was a proper getter/setter
          instead of a 'value' descriptor.
        - Add more tests to cover other Window properties (such as 'name') which are
          actual getter / setters to make sure using the current window's getter on
          a cross origin window does not bypass the security origin checks.

        * http/tests/security/cross-frame-access-getOwnPropertyDescriptor-expected.txt:
        * http/tests/security/cross-frame-access-getOwnPropertyDescriptor.html:
        - Drop checks for properties for which cross-origin access via
        getOwnPropertyDescriptor() now works. They used to not work because of the bug
        this patch fixes, and not due to security checks.
        - Most of these properties are part of the properties that the specification
        states can be accessed cross-origin:
          https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#security-window
        - ALL of these properties could already be accessed cross origin via regular
        property getters (e.g. crossOriginWindow.blur) in Safari 9 so there should not
        be any reason for getOwnPropertyDescriptor() not to work.
        - I have also verified that Firefox allows cross-origin access for all these
          properties (via regular getters or getOwnPropertyDescriptor), except for
          the 'history' property. We may want to align our behavior here and prevent
          cross-origin access to 'window.history' but this is not a regression in this
          patch. You could already access crossOriginWindow.history in Safari 9.

        [SVG] Add support for 'lighter' operator in feComposite
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141376

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Add case to support lighter to DOM manipulation test for feComposite.
        Add a new reftest that tests lighter case and supercedes older
        pixel test for other modes.

        * svg/dom/script-tests/SVGAnimatedEnumeration-SVGFECompositeElement.js:
          Test DOM read/write of SVGFEComposite operator property with new
          lighter mode.
        * svg/dom/SVGAnimatedEnumeration-SVGFECompositeElement-expected.txt:
        * svg/filters/feCompositeOpaque.html: Added.
          A reftest that supersedes svg/filters/feComposite.svg
          That test used opacity 0.5 which resulted in differing colors
          across platforms. This makes it very hard to maintain the references
          but it's probably still useful as a regression test.
          This new test uses solid colors which result in consistency across
          platforms and allow a reftest to be used.

        In order to get the rect into the display list, we need to make the target

        second tile renders. (This complexity is required because in simpler scenarios,
        the rect is clipped out at recording time.)

        CSP: Merge from Blink many new tests and changes to existing tests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153277
        <rdar://problem/24260782>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Merge new Content Security Policy tests from Blink as well as changes made to existing tests
        as of Blink r202656: <https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink/trunk/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/?pathrev=202656>.
        Many of these new tests fail and have been marked accordingly with associated WebKit bugs in
        TestExpectations. We also do not run CSP 1.1 tests as we do not compile with ENABLE(CSP_NEXT)
        enabled (see <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85558>). We will look to enable CSP 1.1
        and make all these merged tests pass in subsequent commits.

        One non-mechanical change I made is that I removed the sub-test for shared workers when
        merging http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/worker-without-own-csp.html as WebKit does
        not support shared workers. I also swapped the argument order in the call to assert_equals()
        in the remaining sub-test so that the expected result, "xhr allowed", is the second argument (as
        expected by assert_equals()) and hence the failure message would read well.

        The tests http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/1.1/frame-ancestors/frame-ancestors-overrides-xfo.html,
        http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/1.1/{script, style}hash-default-src.html do not have
        expected results and are skipped for now. These tests do not have expected results because no
        expected results were committed to Blink and it is not straightforward to generate the expected
        result without reasoning about the test or compiling Blink. When it comes time to enable CSP 1.1
        support we can generate the expected results and verify correctness.

        Add a more comprehensive test for replacing a single text node with innerHTML's setter to ensure
        WebKit's optimization to avoid replacing the node should not be observable by scripts in any way.

        createAttribute should lowercase the attribute name in a HTML document
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153112

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Update tests, rebaseline tests, and add more test cases as needed.

        createAttribute lowercases localName and getAttributeNode finds attribute ignoring cases
        whereas createAttributeNS preserves localName's case and getAttributeNodeNS finds attribute preserving cases

        * fast/dom/Element/mozilla-dom-base-tests/test_bug1075702-expected.txt: Since the test is adding "aa" as well
        as "AA" as Attr nodes, we should be able to get both.
        * fast/dom/Element/mozilla-dom-base-tests/test_bug1075702.xhtml: Renamed from .html file since test cases here
        are more relevant for XHTML documents.

        * fast/dom/Element/script-tests/getAttribute-check-case-sensitivity.js:
        (testGetAttributeNodeMixedCase): Change the test case to retrieve the attribute name with lowercase name
        since createAttribute always lowercases the name in a HTML document.
        (testAttribNodeNamePreservesCase): Use getAttributeNode instead of getAttributeNodeNS since the former does
        case insensitive lookup as needed here.
        (testAttribNodeNamePreservesCaseGetNode): Ditto.
        (testAttribNodeNamePreservesCaseGetNode2): Ditto. Use createAttributeNS to create a case-preserving Attr node.

        * fast/dom/Element/setAttributeNode-case-insensitivity-expected.txt:
        * fast/dom/Element/setAttributeNode-case-insensitivity.html: Since getAttributeNode does a case-insensitive

        More displaylist tests, and minor cleanup
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153198

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        A couple more display list tests that check that the computed extent of an item
        includes shadows and transforms.

        WK1 results differ in that they disable should-subpixel-quantize-fonts in the state
        (which is a bug).

        Move some shared JS into a helper file.

        We'll be sharing .js files as well as test expectations between different HTML test files,
        and logging the filename is counter to this goal, as it will change depending on the HTML

        The reason why the tests are not completed after calling testRunner.notifyDone() is that the original navigation()
        is bound as the onload of the iframe which will dispatch two load events. Therefore, navigation() will be called
        twice. Here, change the navigation() to be bound with the main frame's onload function, which will restrict it to
        be called only once.

        Do not let RenderMultiColumnSet/RenderFlowThread mark ancestors dirty while updating scrollbars
        for overflow content. While updating scrollbars, we only layout descendants so marking parents dirty
        is unnecessary and could lead to an invalid dirty state.

        GraphicsContext::computeLineBoundsAndAntialiasingModeForText() always integral ceils the origin y position to offset underline text.
        This additional visual overflow offset is not taken into account by visualOverflowForDecorations().
        Unfortunately we can't compute the exact same offset value while collecting repaint rects, because
        computeLineBoundsAndAntialiasingModeForText() uses CTM scaling before adjusting the offset position.
        Use 1px (css) bottom offset to cover this underling overflow.

        This patch ensures that when a renderer becomes floated, it is moved

        When this floated renderer's previous sibling is an anonymous block, it needs

        We insert positioned renderers into a static map (RenderBlock::gPositionedDescendantsMap) to keep track of them.
        Since this static map is at block level, (positioned)inline renderers use their containing block to store
        their positioned descendants.
        This patch ensures that when an inline element can no longer hold positioned children, we remove them from
        the inline's containing block's map. -unless the container itself can hold positioned renderers(see RenderElement::canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects).

        document.execCommand("indent") generates a blockquote wrapper and moves the indented content inside.
        If the indented content is already inside a selection, we need to make sure that newly created flow uses
        normal line layout.
        This patch fixes the generic case as re-parenting an already selected renderer is not specific to document.execCommand("indent").

        rdar://problem/22229889

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We insert positioned renderers into a static map (RenderBlock::gPositionedDescendantsMap) to keep track of them.
        This static map is at block level. A particular absolute positioned object is added to its closest ancestor that
        returns true for RenderElement::canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects().
        canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects() returns true if the ancestor is either positioned or has transform.
        If this container's style changes so that it's no longer positioned and it has no transform anymore,
        we need to clear its static map of positioned objects (they'll get re-inserted to another ancestor at next layout).

        This patch addresses the case when the renderer does not have transforms anymore.

        <rdar://problem/22748363>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        The test case is from Blink r175601:
        https://codereview.chromium.org/317513002
        The test case will generate a set of weird ordering events that affects the documentLoader:
        1. The subframe finishes loading, and since the frame’s testRunner is not set to wait until
        done, WebKitTestRunner stops the load (by calling WKBundlePageStopLoading()).
        2. This causes the in-progress XHR to be aborted, which causes its readyState to become DONE
        (this bug doesn’t always reproduce because sometimes the XHR has already finished before the
        frame finishes loading).
        3. The onreadystatechange callback is executed, which sets innerHTML on the parent frame.
        4. Setting innerHTML disconnects the subframe, nulling out its DocumentLoader.
        5. We return to WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDidFinishLoad() from step #1, but now the
        FrameLoader’s DocumentLoader is null. And WebKit crashes here.

        Note that steps 2-4 happen synchronously inside WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDidFinishLoad().
