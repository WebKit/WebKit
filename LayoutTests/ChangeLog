        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27627>

        Fix the 'pauseAnimationAtTimeOnElementWithId' and 'pauseTransitionAtTimeOnElementWithId' APIs
        available to LayoutTests to work with accelerated animations and transitions. Done by sending
        the pause time down to the GraphicsLayer, and using it to stop time on the layer.
        
        I also added an assertion to check that the animation has actually started when we
        try to pause it, to check that the pause time we compute is valid. This revealed a number
        of tests that tried to pause before animations started, required some amount of test fixing.

        This test crawls the object tree under the inner window, finding
        one of each type of JavaScript object.  It depends on all objects having
        a valid prototype chain with a unique name (which is not always the case).
        The test tries to stress the cases where the objects would be lazily
        creating other objects or their prototypes or constructors which would
        require these objects to have a back-pointer to the globalObject to be
        able to correctly wire up the prototype chains.

        Refactoring of indentRegion to fix bugs 26816 and 25317
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26816
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25317
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23995 (partially)

        This patch implements appendParagraphIntoNode, a simpler specialized version of moveParagraph
        and replaces all calls inside indentRegion. The following is the new behavior of indentRegion.

        1. We try to indent as many wrapping nodes as possible.
           e.g. when indenting "hello" in <div>hello</div>, we try to indent div as well.
        2. We do not delete any wrapping elements
           With moveParagraph, we used to remove all wrapping nodes, and replaced with a blockquote.
           This was causing https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23995 for indentation.
           With appendParagraphIntoNode, we can preserve all wrapping nodes.
        3. We only split the tree until the closest block node instead of until the root editable node.
           This behavioral change fixes the bug 25317.
        4. When multiple paragraphs are indented, we indent the highest common ancestor within the selection.
           e.g. when a list is a child node of a div, and the entire div is intended,
                we enclose the div by a single blockquote.
        
        Note that new behavior is more consistent with that of Internet Explorer and Firefox.
        To demonstrate this, the following tests are added and rebaselined.

        at which point the value is always correct. And we can't do a
        LayoutTest which snapshots the wrong value because it is buried
        in the hardware renderer, which we can't get to. But if you

        Tweak mouseout-dead-subframe.html to be more robust.

        The test calls notifyDone() and then dumpAsText(). The latter call has no effect
        as notifyDone() performs the dump, but it passes in the mac DRT because the mime-type
        of the .html file is detected as text/plain and therefore the text is dumped instead
        of the render tree.

        Changed the testcase to call dumpAsText() first and then notifyDone(), to make it
        pass without relying on the mime type detection.

        That also makes the test pass in the Qt DRT.

        * fast/events/mouseout-dead-subframe.html: Swapped notifyDone() and dumpAsText() calls to
        call the former before the latter.

        fast/js/global-recursion-on-full-stack.html is a little finicky.

        The test recurses down the JS stack to find the bottom (catching this with an exception),
        then tries to call a host function (document.write), switch writes new '<script>' code,
        and expects this code to be run, then expects this code to try to call 'f();' again,
        which it expects to fail, and it expects to catch that exception.  However it is possible
        that one of the earlier stages (the call to document.write, entering the interpreter to
        run the new global code) will fail, depending on exactly how much stack space was free at
        the point the last call to f() failed.

        Tweak the test to make it work.

        Make unconfirmed IME text affect textarea's value.
        This matches input and contentEditable elements as well
        IE and Firefox.

        This fixes https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25061.

        Input elements would go down this code path because it
        would always get a null compositionNode from frame->editor().
        Special casing compositionNodes is wrong because we explicitly
        want unconfirmed IME input in the textarea's value (assuming we
        want to match IE and Firefox here).

        This change is originally created by Ojan Vafai <ojan@chromium.org> and
        I just changed its manual tests with an automated test on his behalf.

        Bug 26156: In view-source mode, always render the contents using HTMLViewSourceDocument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26156

        When in view-source mode, render the contents using HTMLViewSourceDocument
        regardless it's applicable for any plugin or not.

        Chromium tells WebCore to render the contents of specified URL when
        view-source: prefix is added to the URL. But currently, DOMImplementation
        ignores inViewSourceMode() when the MIME type is indicating that the contents
        are neither texts nor HTML family documents.

        For example, we can check the contents of asf file without launching media
        player. Rendering contents for view-source:-specified input is not what user
        expects.

        http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10545

        I want to fix this issue by this patch. IMHO, regardless of this Chromium
        specific issue, I think we should force use of HTMLViewSourceDocument when
        inViewSourceMode() is specified.

        Add an additional test for bug 23786 (mistreatment of CR/LF 
        as zero-width characters in Chromium port).  Tests using Bidi text were
        added when the fix was checked in. Without the patch, Chromium used
        to fail the same way with LTR complex scripts as well. (that is,
        CR and LF were treated as zero-width space). To prevent a potential
        regression in the future, a new test with Hindi (a LTR complex script)
        is added. 

        The expected results for Mac and Windows are added while this test
        is added to Skipped file for gtk. I guess this test just needs
        a new test result generated on gtk.

        Undo the changeset 21212 to fix the regression bug 14062.
        The changeset 21212 attempted to fix rdar://problem/5002441.
        The changeset 21212 modified InsertTextCommand::input so as to convert
        all spaces in text to non-breaking spaces for rdar://problem/5002441.
        However, the bug was originally caused by rebalanceWhitespaceAt
        and this workaround introduced a regression bug 14062.
        Because rebalanceWhitespaceAt appears to behave correctly now,
        the workaround introduced in 21212 is no longer needed.

        The following test cases are affected by this change.
        This patch removes unappropriate non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and
