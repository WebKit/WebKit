        Web Inspector: remove old inspector tests that cannot be ported
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129168

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Remove many tests that were specific to the old inspector user interface.
        These cannot be ported either because they were specific to the UI, or
        they test features that no longer exist in the Web Inspector.

        The test col-and-colgroup-offsets.html is failing on the Apple Win Debug (Tests) bot due

        Add tests for regions in multi-column elements and a test that verifies

        For the non horizontal-tb writing modes tests there's no overflow after the
