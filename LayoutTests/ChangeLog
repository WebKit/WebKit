        Subpixel rendering: Nested layers with subpixel accumulation paint to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.
        
        Compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> floored painting position (0, 0)
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2), 
        but the actual painting offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of parent flooring.
        
        Non-compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> GraphicsContext is translated to (0, 0).
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2)
        but the GraphicsContext's offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of the parent's translate.   

        In both cases, without the subpixel adjustment, we'd paint the current layer at (10.0, 10.0)
        after flooring, while its painting position is actually (10.5, 10.5).
        Subpixels do accumulate through nested layers.

        The scrolling tree only needs to know the size of the viewport, not its

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Static property tables are currently duplicated on first use from read-only memory into dirty memory
        in every process, and since the entries are large (48 bytes) and the tables can be unusually sparse
        (we use a custom hash table without a rehash) a lot of memory may be wasted.

        Subpixel rendering: Simple compositing container layer (isSimpleContainerCompositingLayer) paints to wrong position.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that both the simple and non-simple cases paint to the same position.
        Simple compositing container layer codepath needs to take the fractional device pixel offset
        into account when painting. Without the fractional value, the final paint rounding could push the
        paint offset to a different position.
        retina example:
        compositing top-left: 0px 0px.
        fractional offset: 0.3px 0.3px
        painting coords without offseting: 0px 0px

        Fix crash in CompositeEditCommand::cloneParagraphUnderNewElement()

        https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?revision=168160&view=revision
        http://crbug.com/345005

            The root cause is CompositeEditCommand::moveParagraphWithClones() passing
            two positions |start| and |end| which do not follow the document order,
            i.e. in some situations |start| is located after |end| because of
            the difference in affinity.

            This patch fixes this crash by normalizing |end| to |start| in such situations.
            It also adds an ASSERT that checks the relationship between |start| and |end|.

        outlineBoundsForRepaint() is expected to return the outline repaint rect. Using enclosingIntRect()
        to calculate the outline boundaries breaks repaint logic in RenderElement::repaintAfterLayoutIfNeeded().
        Since enclosingIntRect() can return bigger rect than repaint rect, the old/new bounds' dimensions could end up
        being different which triggers the size change repaint code path.

        using overflow: hidden. It makes sure that this is exactly the same as a single underline. If the
        space between the two underlines does not scale with font size, it will appear as though there is a
        single thick underline (because they will be drawn on top of each other) and will thus fail this test.

        Ensure keySplines is valid in SMIL animations

        http://crbug.com/276111

            This patch fixes a crash in SMIL animations when keySplines are not
            specified. The SMIL spec is clear on this:
            http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncCalcMode
            "If there are any errors in the keyTimes specification (bad values,
            too many or too few values), the animation will have no effect."

            This patch simply checks that keyTimes is not empty. Previously,
            splinesCount was set to be m_keySplines.size() + 1 in
            SVGAnimationElement.cpp; this patch changes splinesCount to be equal
            to m_keySplines.size() to make the logic easier to follow and to
            match other checks in SVGAnimationElement::startedActiveInterval.

        Filters should test for area instead of single dimension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123716

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        A filtered SVG element with a sigle dimension bigger than 5000
        (counting the margin/border) will fail to render. So an element
        with 4000x4000 will render fine, while another with 5000x10
        won't. This patch instead tests against the total element area,
        which fixes such cases.

        The current patch fixes the rendering issue and at same time,
        fixes some layer violations where FilterEffectRenderer and
        RenderSVGResourceFilter were directly accessing the kMax value
        in FilterEffect. Since before a somewhat bigger filter would
        be aborted, it required to change the maximum kernel size
        for blur filter (some filters are slower to run than others for
        bigger SVGs).

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This test changes the page scale factor to a very large value, simulating
        the user zooming in with a trackpad. It then positions the viewport
        to a place where the underline should not be drawn. It then compares this
        to a completely white page.

        This explanation cannot be in the test itself because the test sets the
        scale factor too high for the tester to be able to read text.

        Bug 119043 - Large stretch size error for MathML operators.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119043

        This adds a test to check that the depth/height of stretchy operators match the maximum of their siblings. This also fixes the reference of mo-stretch.html to ignore the stretch error.

        Bug 119043 - Large stretch size error for MathML operators.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119043

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        This adds a test to check that the depth/height of stretchy operators match the maximum of their siblings. This also fixes the reference of mo-stretch.html to ignore the stretch error.

        The test col-and-colgroup-offsets.html is failing on the Apple Win Debug (Tests) bot due

        For now, I am landing Windows-specific expected results as the behavior tested by the test

        Add tests for regions in multi-column elements and a test that verifies

        For the non horizontal-tb writing modes tests there's no overflow after the
        last region because it's not rendered correctly yet in a new column.
