        Recycling a webgl context when it has been lost and restored causes a crash
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238024

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Creating excessive amount of contexts will lose the oldest context via
        "simulated context lost" logic, making the contexts non-restorable.

        Previously the test tried to test that requesting a restore on a context that
        had simulated context lost would not restore. However, the test was invalid,
        as it asserted that the context is still lost immediately after preventDefault():

          event.preventDefault();
          if (!contexts[0].isContextLost())
             document.getElementById("result").textContent = "FAIL";

        This is not correct, as the preventDefault() only informs the browser
        that the context should be restored. The restore happens asynchronously.

        Fix the test logic and add extra cases. Make the logic as such:
        1. Lose the context in some way
        2. Wait for context lost event, request restore
        3. Optionally do something that would trigger another way of losing the context
        4. Run assertions about context being still expectedly lost

        The failures in the test expectation:
        FAIL getError expected: INVALID_OPERATION. Was NO_ERROR :
        FAIL getError expected: CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL. Was NO_ERROR :
        bug 236965

        FAIL Expected restore be ignored, but it was not.

        LayoutTests/webgl/max-active-contexts-gc.html is flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237466

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.
        The test:
         - created 16 WebGL contexts
         - unreferenced 8 WebGL contexts.
         - forced gc
         - added 9 WebGL contexts.
        The test tries to test that GC removes unreferenced contexts.
        To assert this, it ends up with 17 contexts, which is 1 above
        the maximum active limit. This means one context is lost and the
        implementation prints one line of error.

        Since the GC is not exact, sometimes it would only collect 7 of the 8
        unreferenced contexts. This would mean two error messages.

        Fix by trying to collect each time a context is unreferenced. This seems to be
        more predictable.

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        WebRTC pipeline is lossy so frames might disappear.
        For that reason, we need to send multiple times the same frame to ensure we can read the expected frame.
        To ensure we are not reading a previous test frame, what we do is changing the size of the canvas before doing the test.
        This patch reduces the number of iterations to ensure the test is not too long to run.

        Video element videoWidth/videoHeight are updated when track settings are changed,
        and not when video frames being received.

        This does not guarantee that videoWidth/videoHeight (main thread) are fully in sync
        with the actual video frames (background thread) when there is a change of size.

        We might be able to tighten this in MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC by only resorting on video frames.
        In the meantime, we update the test to use requestVideoFrameCallback which provides accurate per frame metadata.

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        Since r216096 the notification for menu list changes is deffered, so we need to wait one run loop cycle to get
        the notifications. Also update the test to ignore notifications that are not interesting like AXLoadComplete and
        AXElementBusyChanged, and update expectations for the new behavior with ATSPI where the notification is emitted
        on the menu and not the combo.

        Video element videoWidth/videoHeight are updated when track settings are changed,
        and not when video frames being received.

        This does not guarantee that videoWidth/videoHeight (main thread) are fully in sync
        with the actual video frames (background thread) when there is a change of size.

        We might be able to tighten this in MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC by only resorting on video frames.
        In the meantime, we update the test to set the orientation before creating the source.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The code used "!result.type" to check for an invalid type. However,
        the first type in the FTPEntryType enum is FTPDirectoryEntry, so this
        was actually returning true for directories, turning them into "junk"
        entries which would not be listed.

        Since the code for EPLF can only result in either files, directories,
        or uninitialized/junk entries, the check can be removed, returning
        result.type is the correct thing to do in all 3 cases.
