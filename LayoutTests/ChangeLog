        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        As per the specification [1], when clearing a registration, the registration's workers are first
        marked as redundant *before* the registration's worker is set to null.

        The test was waiting for the service worker's state to become redundant and then checking in a
        setTimeout(0) that the registration's worker became null. However, a setTimeout(0) is racy here.
        To address the issue, we now use setInterval() and wait until the worker becomes null.

        Adds tests to ensure that we can apply and remove the substitution of one or more
        elements with the alternative presentation button.

        Also added some accessibility tests to ensure that the alternative presentation button
        can be seen and hit tested by the accessibility machinery. When the alternative presentation
        button is substituted for an <input> it masquerades as a text button and when it is
        substituted for an arbitrary HTML element it masquerades as the original element. As a
        result the accessibility machinery shows an empty role description in the former case
        because it does find the ARIA label for the button and the accessibility element hierarchy
        may be incorrect in the latter case. We will fix these issues in a subsequent commit(s).

        If this test fails, it will fail with random numbers in the failure
        message. The current platform-neutral expectation file contains one
        pair of these random numbers, ensuring that this test will never be
        interpreted as passing -- not while the bug exists, and not when it
        is fixed.

        This change updates the expectation file to contain only passes and
        enables the test for WPE and GTK, as the bug does not seem to exist
        there.

        The expectations are platform-specific because the test times out on mac.

        This follows our policy of creating -expected files with failures for

        Fix up the test http/tests/xmlhttprequest/gzip-content-type-no-content-encoding.html to
        actually check that we do not sniff content encoding. CFNetwork only sniffs the URL
        for the content encoding when the filename ends with known file extension (e.g. .gz)

        http/tests/cache/iframe-304-crash.html used to deterministically record its didFinishLoading callback,
        but only for WK1.  It was marked as flaky for all WK2 ports.  It is now flaky in WK1 because the order
        of the testRunner.notifyDone call and the didFinishLoading logging is no longer deterministic with
        asynchronous loading, but the test still verifies that there is no crash.

        http/tests/security/cross-origin-modal-dialog-base.html does navigation during showModalDialog, which
        probably should've never worked in WK1 and never worked in WK2.  WK1 behavior now matches WK2 behavior.
        I'm not aware of any complaints about no navigation working during showModalDialog in WK2 and I imagine
        nobody will be regressed by this change, but if we do find such a problem, creative use of MessageQueues
        like we do with sync xhr in WK1 now could theoretically fix the problem, but we are trying to get
        rid of showModalDialog anyway.  The test was written to verify that the SecurityOrigin doesn't fall back
        to the wrong origin, and it certainly doesn't now.

        These tests dump load delegate call order, which are less deterministic now but the tests still behave correctly.

        [Web Animations] Expose the playbackRate property on Animation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178931

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Web Inspector: Support `async test() { ... }` in Inspector Test Suites
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178614

        Reviewed by Devin Rousso.

        Add the ability to have test functions be async functions. A successful
        async test function just needs to complete evaluation. To indicate
        failure it should throw an exception.

            suite.addTestCase({
                name: "ExceptionOfNormal",
                async test() {
                    InspectorTest.expectThat(...);
                }
            });

            suite.addTestCase({
                name: "ExampleOfRejection",
                async test() {
                    let value = await SomeAgent.method();
                    if (value.error)
                        throw "Exception";
                    ...
                }
            });

        Using async test functions has the added benefit that a runtime exception
        inside of asynchronous test code will reject the current test case instead
        of timing out. For example...
        
            suite.addTestCase({
                name: "ExampleOfRejectionThroughRuntimeException",
                async test() {
                    let arr = [];
                    arr.this.does.not.exist;
                }
            });
        
        ... should will lead to a failure instead of a timeout.
        
        This should allow us to structure some common tests more naturally, like so:

            suite.addTestCase({
                name: "ExampleOfNormalAsyncTest",
                async test() {
                    InspectorTest.evaluateInPage(`...`);
                    let event = await WI.Manager.awaitEvent(...);
                    let resource = event.data.resource;
                    InspectorTest.expectEqual(...);
                    InspectorTest.expectEqual(...);
                    InspectorTest.expectEqual(...);
                }

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178606

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        The bug was caused by the race condition during the page loading of iframes.

        Waiting for message event wasn't doing anything useful because it was receiving the message from
        source iframe before the drag & drop had started.

        Make failing WebGL tests produce debug output
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178421

        Reviewed by Jon Lee.

        If a WebGL conformance test fails, we just get the word "FAIL". Instead,
        have it log the actual output of the test, so we can see what happens
        on bots.

        Drive-by fix where I noticed a test file was missing, that causes
        two tests to timeout. They may still timeout, but now because they
        take a long time to run rather than they have a JS error.

        In the iframe, the test was being run after 0ms.  Sometimes, the whole iframe hadn't loaded yet,

        the test to wait for the iframe to finish loading before running the test, then post a message to

        always work after the iframe had finished loading.

        Like r223445, in WebKit2 (and WebKit1 with asynchronous loading) sometimes the iframe would start
        loading before the main resource loading finished, sometimes it wouldn't.  This isn't a problem,
        and the rest of the test is still valid, but in order to make the dumped delegate callbacks deterministic,
        we make it so the iframe always starts loading after the main resource is done loading.

        [MSE][GStreamer] Insert parser elements in AppendPipeline when demuxing opus or Vorbis
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178076

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        YouTube does not include durations in the WebM container for files
        containing Opus audio, so we need to read them from the contained
        stream. Fortunately, GStreamer has an element to do that: opusparse.

        The same thing happens with Vorbis contained in WebM files from the
        W3C tests, which should also be fixed by the GStreamer element
        vorbisparse.

        This patch adds an opusparse or vorbisparse element to the
        AppendPipeline at the sinkpad of the demuxer when either is found.

        Tests: updated expectations.

        http/tests/cache/iframe-304-crash.html used to deterministically record its didFinishLoading callback,
        but only for WK1.  It was marked as flaky for all WK2 ports.  It is now flaky in WK1 because the order
        of the testRunner.notifyDone call and the didFinishLoading logging is no longer deterministic with
        asynchronous loading, but the test still verifies that there is no crash.

        http/tests/security/cross-origin-modal-dialog-base.html does navigation during showModalDialog, which
        probably should've never worked in WK1 and never worked in WK2.  WK1 behavior now matches WK2 behavior.
        I'm not aware of any complaints about no navigation working during showModalDialog in WK2 and I imagine
        nobody will be regressed by this change, but if we do find such a problem, creative use of MessageQueues
        like we do with sync xhr in WK1 now could theoretically fix the problem, but we are trying to get
        rid of showModalDialog anyway.  The test was written to verify that the SecurityOrigin doesn't fall back
        to the wrong origin, and it certainly doesn't now.

        These tests dump load delegate call order, which are less deterministic now but the tests still behave correctly.

        This test could fail since we would start it before the time control was fully sized and only
        the scrubber had bounds, but not the elapsed time label. We have to wait on both being fully
        sized before starting the test and only then it is reliable.

        In cases where this test failed, it actually worked as expected but the "timeupdate" event would be fired
        twice, most likely because it was registered twice. We now use an asynchronous expectation to run the test
        which should only register the event listener once and make the test more reliable.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        We have test coverage for getData and setData with non-normalized types on some of our bots where custom
        pasteboard data is enabled by default, but this is not the case in EWS. This patch adds a copy and paste test
        that exercises this codepath across all Cocoa platforms.

        Non-prevalent resources should be allowed access to existing cookies in a third-party context
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177336
        <rdar://problem/34578257>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        This patch restructures what is communicated to the network process,
        from two vectors - with user interaction and without user interaction -
        to three vectors - to partition, to block, to neither partition nor block.
        The previous two vectors did not allow proper categorization into which
        domains should be partitioned, blocked, or left alone. That was the cause
        of the regression where non-prevalent third-party domains erroneously had
        their cookies blocked when they should fall back to the old behavior of
        access but no new cookies allowed to be set.

        Re-enable tests under editing/pasteboard in iOS WebKit2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176890

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        These tests were disabled because we used to run multiple layout tests tests in parallel within
        a single instance of iOS simulator, and that caused tests that read from and write to UIPasteboard
        with interfere with one another. This is no longer an issue since we launch a simulator per worker.

        Re-enabled these pasteboard tests under iOS simulator in WebKit2 and rebaselined the tests.
        We're going to triage failures and crashes in WebKit1 separately.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Storage Access API is an experimental feature which allows cross-origin,
        sandboxed iframes to request access to their first-party storage (as
        opposed to partitioned storage). This might be restricted to cookies or
        might cover all stateful mechanisms.

        It introduces the following three developer-facing things:
        - A new readonly attribute, document.hasStorageAccess.
        - A new function, document.requestStorageAccess().
        - A new iframe sandbox token, allow-storage-access-by-user-activation.

        Introduce Storage Access API (document parts) as an experimental feature
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175759
        <rdar://problem/33666847>

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Storage Access API is an experimental feature which allows cross-origin,
        sandboxed iframes to request access to their first-party storage (as
        opposed to partitioned storage). This might be restricted to cookies or
        might cover all stateful mechanisms.

        It introduces the following three developer-facing things:
        - A new readonly attribute, document.hasStorageAccess.
        - A new function, document.requestStorageAccess().
        - A new iframe sandbox token, allow-storage-access-by-user-activation.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Before r221670 (FreeType rebase) this test case would fail due to
        bug in FreeType where it was providing wrong font extents for specific
        fonts and sizes. Before the rebase the selection was incorrectly
        restored on the end of the first line. Adding this new test to catch
        any possible regression in the FreeType.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Add a basic gl.getActiveUniforms() test that checks proper return values
        for a mat4 uniform in the simple vertex shader that's used when creating
        the 'standard' program through webgl-test.js utilities. The test remains
        skipped on GTK+ and Windows (WebGL 2.0 disabled). Mac port skips it as
        well since the shader can't be compiled properly. WPE and iOS run the

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172518

        This unflakes the test by downloading a "timer" image and kicking off the timer that runs the
        test only once that image was downloaded, while potentially waiting for the preloaded images to arrive,
        up to 1 second.
        That means that slow test environments would have a longer timer than today, avoiding flakiness.

        The last time it intermittently timed out was on r194436.
        (It also timed out between r200951 and r201016, but that was consistent
        and unrelated.)

        The test needs to run through the entire audio file twice, so it will
        take several seconds by design. GTK used to have a shorter timeout,
        which was extended in r218270. The test hasn't timed out since.

        [WebCrypto] Add layout tests covering EC P-521
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175659

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Add layout tests that cover operations with 521-bit elliptic curves.
        The newly-introduced tests are skipped on all platforms for now since
        no implementation provides support just yet. The already-existing tests
        are modified in a way that only tests the EC P-521 capability optionally,
        if e.g. P-521 key imports are successful, without affecting the tests for
        P-256 and P-384 operations.

        The newly-introduced tests are mirros of existing P-256 and P-384 tests,
        but they specifically test the P-521 capabilities and use appropriate
        curve information (X and Y coordinates for the EC public key, D for the
        EC private key) for that type of elliptic curve.

        When an XHR is pending and navigating away, we would send an abort event before the navigation and an error event after
        restoring from PageCache. This bug was not seen before because the test only checked for error events, not abort ones.
        The expected behavior is now that we fire an error event before navigating away, similar to the non-PageCache case.
        The only case where the error event should be fired after restoring from PageCache is when an XHR is done in the pagehide
        event handler, because it is too late to send the error event to the page before navigating in this case. I added test
        coverage for this case.

        Rebaseline a few tests now that the Origin header is properly set of our Beacon
        requests. This is a progression and matches the results from Blink.

        Our Content-Type header for ArrayBuffer / ArrayBufferView payloads has also
        changed. It is unclear which one is best but at least we are now consistent
        with Fetch.

        ScrollingTreeOverflowScrollingNodeIOS uses the wrong fixed position rectangle
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175135

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch adds a new test for a position:fixed element inside an overflow node inside an
        iframe. When scrolling the overflow node, the position of such an element should remain fixed
        relative to the inner frame. Before that change, ScrollingTreeOverflowScrollingNodeIOS used
        to take the main frame as a reference instead, causing the element to flicker and even to
        disappear when the user scrolls that overflow node. We add a reftest to verify that the
        element is visible and positioned at the correct location when the user scrolls.

        [WebCrypto] Add PKCS#8 import test that covers `parameters` and `publicKey` values in ECPrivateKey
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174420

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Add test cases that cover testing of the optional ECParameters and publicKey bit string
        attributes in the ECPrivateKey ASN.1 structure that's embedded in the PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo
        ASN.1 structure.

        Per the spec, if the ECParameters attribute in the ECPrivateKey structure is present, the
        relevant curve object identifier should match the same curve identifier that's used in the
        ECParameters attribute of the AlgorithmIdentifier structure in PrivateKeyInfo. Both of these
        should of course match the curve that was specified for the import operation.

        For the publicKey bit string, the data contained there should be properly formatted for
        the specific curve, meaning it should be of proper curve-specific size and that it should
        use 0x04 as the leading byte, signalling an uncompressed EC point. On top of that the public
        key should have a valid value that positions it on the specified elliptic curve.

        These cases are covered for PKCS#8 key imports for P-256 and P-384 curves and for both ECDH
        and ECDSA algorithms in the newly-introduced tests. They are skipped on all platforms since
        no implementation in WebKit can pass them yet.

        * fast/text/international/embed-bidi-style-in-isolate-crash.html: Removed onerror attribute
        in the audio element in this test. The error event does fire during the test, which causes
        the test to fail. Before, the test was prematurely exiting before the load failed, preventing
        the test from failing, but also meaning we didn't finish running the test.

        * imported/blink/fast/dom/Window/open-window-features-fuzz.html: Use waitUntilDone and
        notifyDone to prevent the test from exiting prematurely. Use a URL that won't trigger loading
        outside the web browser; the URL is not what mattered to this test. Before, the test was
        prematurely exiting before the test ran. Note also, that I don't think this is testing
        much effectively; not sure we are getting any benefit from this test since before it was
        not really running to completion anyway.

        * media/event-queue-crash-expected.txt: Updated expectations to expect syntax error. Before
        there was a race and often the test exited before the syntax error could be logged.

        * platform/mac/TestExpectations: Removed flakiness expectation from the
        media/event-queue-crash.html test. What made it flaky was a race with the load event,
        and that race should be fixed by the change to FrameLoader::checkLoadCompleteForThisFrame.
        The same race existed on all platforms, not just Mac, so this flakiness expectation should
        be in the main TextExpectations file if anywhere. But I believe it is not needed at all.
        For media/modern-media-controls/media-documents/background-color-and-centering.html,
        added image failure expectation because under modern WebKit on Mac the image now captures
        the upper left hand corner of the controls overlay. Still seems to pass on iOS and the bug
        this was created for was iOS-specific, so should be OK for now.

        Async image decoding for large images should be disabled after the first time a tile is painted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174451
        <rdar://problem/31246421>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        To test async image decoding for large images, we have to create the <img>
        element dynamically so we can listen to the load and webkitImageFrameReady
        events and know reliably when to end the test. But with this patch the async
        image decoding for large images will be disabled after the first paint. 
        That means async image decoding for large images will be disabled always
        unless we force the async image decoding till the image is painted for the
        first time. We use Internals::setLargeImageAsyncDecodingEnabledForTesting()
        to force the async image decoding. So painting an image in this case will
        require multiple paints; in all of them the async image decoding will be
        enabled. But this is okay because it resembles the case where the <img> is
        created from a static <img> tag in the HTML file.

        For new tests, where we want to make sure that mutating the DOM will not
        cause a flash, async image decoding will be forced till the image is drawn
        for the first time. After that the async image decoding is enabled but not
        forced.

        Disable new tests for WK1 because the async image decoding is always enabled
        because tiling does not necessarily exist in WK1 . But eventually the async
        image decoding for large images will be always disabled for WK1.

        Add attribute allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation to iframe sandbox
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171327

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        This patch adds tests to verify that a sandboxed iframe with the flag
        'allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation' or 'allow-top-navigation' can navigate the top
        level page, if navigation is triggered by a user gesture. This is based on a test from the
        Chromium repository.
        It also verifies that navigation fails when 'allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation' is
        absent, even when it is triggered by a user gesture.

        * http/tests/security/frameNavigation/resources/iframe-that-performs-parent-navigation-with-user-activation.html: Added. This is similar to iframe-that-performs-parent-navigation.html but it

        Async image decoding for large images should be disabled after the first time a tile is painted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174451

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        To test async image decoding for large images, we have to create the <img>
        element dynamically so we can listen to the load and webkitImageFrameReady
        events and know reliably when to end the test. But with this patch the async
        image decoding for large images will be disabled after the first paint. 
        That means async image decoding for large images will be disabled always
        unless we force the async image decoding till the image is painted for the
        first time. We use Internals::setLargeImageAsyncDecodingEnabledForTesting()
        to force the async image decoding. So painting an image in this case will
        require multiple paints; in all of them the async image decoding will be
        enabled. But this is okay because it resembles the case where the <img> is
        created from a static <img> tag in the HTML file.

        For new tests, where we want to make sure that mutating the DOM will not
        cause a flash, async image decoding will be forced till the image is drawn
        for the first time. After that the async image decoding is enabled but not
        forced.

        Disable new tests for WK1 because the async image decoding is always enabled
        because tiling does not necessarily exist in WK1 . But eventually the async
        image decoding for large images will be always disabled for WK1.

        This commit is a first step to replace the use of testRunner.overridePreference with
        internals.settings.set* calls in tests. Such a call will fail immediately and obviously if
        its a function that does not exist, and these settings are restored properly between tests.
        Some preferences that do not have a WebCore setting or an internals.settings setter are not
        handled yet. The temporary failure added in r218480 for fast/frames/flattening/set-preference

        MediaSource duration attribute should not be equal to Infinity when set to a value greater than 2^64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171668

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        MediaSource duration attribute is a double represented in MediaSource by a MediaTime instance created with
        MediaTime::CreateWithDouble(). This method implements an overflow control mechanism which sets MediaTime to
        Infinity when the double value passed as argument is greater than 2^64.

        This patch removes the overflow control mechanism when time value is represented as a double. This patch also
        modifies the behavior of mathematical operations between a double MediaTime and rational MediaTime: the rational
        MediaTime is converted to a double before applying the operation. Double MediaTime precision is the same as for
        double. Overflow mechanisms still apply to the conversion of a double MediaTime to rational with setTimescale()
        method. No behavior change for rational MediaTime.

        Update test expectations.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171792

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Since r215188 opening a popup menu in a form pre-selects the active
        element to mimic GtkComboxBox behavior, but the layout test implicitly
        assumed that type ahead search always started the beginning of the
        list, which is no longer true now that GTK+ is informed of which one
        is the active element.

        Call testRunner.waitUntilDone() in the DOMContentLoader event listener if jsTestIsAsync is already
        set then, instead of waiting for the load event listener to do so. This is needed because some
        tests may decide to complete *before* the load event has fired, such as the test updated in this
        patch. We still need to call testRunner.waitUntilDone() in the load event listener as well because
        some tests only set jsTestIsAsync in a load event handler.

        [GTK] Tests that always pass when run alone, but fail in the bots
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168572

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        PlatformWebView::viewSupportsOptions() is basically a comparison
        that checks that the passed options are the ones supported by the
        web view. There is no reason for them to be implemented for each
        platform differently. In fact doing so causes issues each time a
        new option is added, if the corresponding platform implementation
        is not updated accordingly.

        A consequence of not updating the viewSupportOptions()
        implementations when new options are added is that tests that need
        these options might fail if they are executed after a test that
        didn't need the option, as the webview will be reused even if the
        option is not supported. This cannot be spotted when running the
        tests individually. See bug #165133 for other example of the same
        problem.

        Remove the platform implementations and make the comparison a
        method of the TestOptions structure, so that the check is in one
        place. For the time being include in the comparison the options
        checked in the mac and ios platforms, which seem to be the only
        ones relevant this far (unless newer ones have also been
        forgotten).

        LayoutTest http/tests/media/track-in-band-hls-metadata-crash.html is a flaky timeout
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167749

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        This is a speculative fix of the test. I have not been able to reproduce the timeout.
        When the test times out, the 'addtrack' event is never received. In case the event
        was dispatched before we added the event listener, the event listener is added before
        the video source is set. In case the test will continue to time out, a couple of
        error event callbacks have been added to get more information. Also, video playback
        will begin when the 'canplaythrough' event is received.

        AX: Propagate aria-readonly to grid descendants
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171189

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Add new test cases to aria-readonly.html. In addition, because the platform-specific
        test expectations seem due to how platforms treat whitespace from the test file, hide
        the test cases after the test is run so that there are no extraneous characters and
        a single expectations file can be shared.

        Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148363
        <rdar://problem/18945879>

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Add tests for Subresource Integrity based off the ones from Web 
        Platform Tests. They have been changed to:
        - Split <link> and <script> testing.
        - Add additional tests:
            - Integrity hashes using base64URL encoding.
            - Integrity hashes using mixed base64 and base64URL encoding.
            - Integrity metadata that does not conform to the grammar at all.
            - Multiple valid, but only one matching, integrity hashes.
            - Non-matching integrity hash with options.
        - Run one at a time, so console output is consistent.
        
        We can/should upstream these changes, but this avoids the possibility that
        an update of the imported web-platform-tests could cause these tests to fail.
        
        Also adds tests that show the Subresource Integrity setting works correctly.

        Change the asynchronous image decoding tests to use the event webkitImageFrameReady
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171634

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        To test the async image decoding reliably we need to do the following:

        -- Make sure to load the image before setting its src to the element.
        -- Call document.body.offsetHeight to force layout.
        -- Call testRunner.display() to force the first paint.
        -- Use the webkitImageFrameReady to reliably know when an image frame is ready.
        -- When webkitImageFrameReady is fired call testRunner.notifyDone(). This
           will force the second paint.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        The crypto/subtle/hkdf-derive-bits-length-limits.html test is added, testing the
        corner-case length values for which the bit derivation operation must succeed or
        fail for any specified SHA hash algorithm. With HashLen as the algorithm's output
        length, the operation should reject for lengths of 0 or above 255 * HashLen * 8.
        The operation should resolve for lengths between the two limits, with testing
        performed on lengths of 8 (the minimum output length), HashLen * 8 (matching the
        output length of the hash algorithm), and 255 * HashLen * 8 (the maximum
        derivation output length).

        AX: ARIA "region" role which lacks an accessible name should not be treated as a landmark
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171180

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Add new test cases to several tests so that we have coverage for both named and
        unnamed regions, which now have different mappings. In aria-namefrom-author.html,
        the region role was replaced with the table role because the test requires elements
        which have mapped ARIA roles and lack an author-provided name. A region which lacks
        an author-provided name is no longer mapped as an ARIA role as per the spec. Table
        was introduced in ARIA 1.1 and serves the same purpose with respect to what is
        being tested.

        Enhance shouldBe()/shouldNotBe() to accept anonymous function arguments
        <https://webkit.org/b/171362>
        <rdar://problem/31867686>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        This change makes it possible to pass either the first or second
        argument (or both) as anonymous functions into shouldBe() and
        shouldNotBe() to make it easy to capture local variables when
        writing tests.  This is similar to the change in r202609 for Bug
        159232 for shouldThrow() and shouldNotThrow().

        Note that shouldBe()/shouldNotBe() from the following files were
        NOT updated since they were imported from other projects and did
        share the full WebKit history of resources/js-test-pre.js:

            http/tests/webgl/1.0.2/resources/webgl_test_files/resources/js-test-pre.js

            webgl/1.0.3/resources/webgl_test_files/resources/js-test-pre.js

        However, these files WERE brought up-to-date with the ability to
        pass anonymous functions into shouldBe()/shouldNotBe() for this
        bug, and shouldThrow()/shouldNotThrow() which should have
        originally been fixed with Bug 159232:

        The tests use UIHelper.activateAt(), which in DumpRenderTree dispatches mouse events via EventSender, and in iOS WK2 uses
        UIScriptController to dispatch touch events. The former just use standard hit testing, which works fine.
        The latter go via Frame::qualifyingNodeAtViewportLocation(), which calls ancestorRespondingToClickEvents()
        and does area hit testing, and this fails to find anything clickable inside the <iframe>s.

        Fix by putting a div with an onlick handler inside the iframes, and adjusting the click

        fast/css-grid-layout/grid-simplified-layout-positioned.html was flacky

        and has nothing to do with the caret or "autofocus" behavior.
        "autofocus" was needed to get the crash, so this change modifies

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170157

        Reviewed by Alejandro G. Castro.

        The test fast/mediastream/RTCPeerConnection-inspect-offer-bundlePolicy-bundle-only.html
        is used to check that we generate the "a=bundle-only" lines on the "m=" sections
        according to the bundlePolicy. The 3 possible values of bundlePolicy are tested.
        To properly test bundlePolicy:"balanced" we generate 5 extra tracks (6 in total)
        for each one of the audio media type and video media type.

        * TestExpectations: Set RTCPeerConnection-inspect-offer-bundlePolicy-bundle-only.html
        as failing in the general TestExpectations, because the libwebrtc backend currently
        doesn't generate the expected a=bundle-only lines.
        On the GTK+ port TestExpectations file this is overriden, and the test is marked to pass.

        Add test for expected fallback behavior between stroke-width and -webkit-text-stroke-width.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169466

        Reviewed by Jon Lee.

        Now that we have added support for stroke-width, we should have a test for expected fallback behavior between
        stroke-width and -webkit-text-stroke-width. Currently, stroke-width is always preferred, also when inherited,
        and when -webkit-text-stroke-width is declared inline. When stroke-width is not specified, we fall back to
        -webkit-text-stroke-width.

        <rdar://problem/31380650>

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        The test restores a page from PageCache and wants to check that an animated
        GIF is properly animating. To do so, it store the data of the current image
        frame, and then checks in a 100ms timer that the current image frame is
        different. This is flaky by nature since the image only has 10 frames and
        you therefore have a 1/10 chance that the new frame will be the same as the
        previous one, even if the image is properly animating.

        To address the problem, do a setInterval instead of a setTimeout and check
        until the frame becomes different.

        We extend an existing test to cover the case where we would hide the controls bar while the tracks panel
        is up by mousing out of the media. We also add a new test where we check that clicking over the controls
        bar to dismiss the tracks panel does not hide the controls bar. Finally, we make a small change to an
        existing test to listen to "transitionend" event on the tracks panel specifically since with this patch
        the controls bar would disappear and trigger a similar event when disappearing as the tracks panel is dismissed.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167935
        <rdar://problem/30397128>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We add a new test to check that the various designed constraints to toggle display of a placard's
        icon, title and description are honored. Also, due to the old layout() method now being called
        "commit()", we refactor a relevant test.
