        Undo the changeset 21212 to fix the regression bug 14062.
        The changeset 21212 attempted to fix rdar://problem/5002441.
        The changeset 21212 modified InsertTextCommand::input so as to convert
        all spaces in text to non-breaking spaces for rdar://problem/5002441.
        However, the bug was originally caused by rebalanceWhitespaceAt
        and this workaround introduced a regression bug 14062.
        Because rebalanceWhitespaceAt appears to behave correctly now,
        the workaround introduced in 21212 is no longer needed.

        The following test cases are affected by this change.
        This patch removes unappropriate non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) and
        inserts normal spaces instead.

        This fixs the bug 26361. The original test case did not invoke the event that
        triggered the actual test. This patch adds code to invoke this event, and also
        converts it from a pixel test to a dumpAsText test.
