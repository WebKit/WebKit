            This `isSubSelector` (`context.firstSelectorOfTheFragment == context.selector`) is intended to
            check `relation != CSSSelector::SubSelector`.
            But since this value belongs to the previous selector and it is tested inside the branch that checks
            the next selector isn't SubSelector `relation != CSSSelector::SubSelector`,
            this only matches when the previous selector doesn't has SubSelectors.

            While calculating the rounded rect for painting, the radius is adjusted to compensate
            for the pixel snapped size. However while scaling the radius, certain values overflow
            (float) mantissa and it produces a non-renderable rounded rect where the radius becomes bigger
            than the rectangle dimensions. In such cases, we need to shrink the radius to make it

        Subpixel rendering: Adjust cliprect with devicePixelFractionFromRenderer() before painting.

        The cliprect coming from the graphics layer needs to be adjusted with the subpixel gap
        from renderer. This is symmetric with the offsetting we do, when the dirty rect is sent off to the GraphicsLayer.
        It puts us back to the correct coordinating system for intersecting with renderers.

        Subpixel rendering: Zero sized compositing container's content positioned off by one device pixel.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134903

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The compositing layer boundaries are calculated using its renderer()'s and the renderer()'s
        descendants' bounds. However when the renderer() is zero sized, its bounds are omitted.
        In such cases, when the child content has offset from the renderer(), the subpixel adjustment
        of the compositing layer becomes negative (-meaning that the compositing layer is to the right/bottom
        direction from its renderer()). Remove fabs() to be able to express such direction.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch removes 2 integral roundings from InlineFlowBox:
        1. Border and padding sizes are implicitly integral truncated by the 'int' return type
           of borderLogicalLeft/Right()/paddingLogicalLeft/Right(). It results in losing
           fractional border/padding values.
        2. Painting rectangle is explicitly rounded which pushes border and
           other decoration elements to odd device pixel positions on retina displays.
        These values get pixel snapped right before calling in to GraphicsContext::*.

        CSS JIT: Add positionInRootFragments to SelectorFragment

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Some non-backtrack-related predicates use relationToRightFragment information
        to decide whether checkingContext->elementStyle should be refered.
        To make it works correctly, add the positionInRootFragments field to SelectorFragment.
        When positionInRootFragments == Rightmost and relationToRightFragment == Rightmost,
        we should see checkingContext->elementStyle.

        Remove latinmodern-math.woff from LayoutTests/mathml/opentype
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134094

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        We remove latinmodern-math.woff from the source and make mathml/opentype/*LatinModern* tests not font-specific, so that each platform will use whatever OpenType MATH is available.
        Until bug 133604 is fixed and Latin Modern Math installed on the Linux bots, the tests are marked as failed. More generally, we need to fix bug 133603.
        The test mathml/opentype/roots-LatinModern is removed since it will duplicate mathml/presentation/roots.xhtml when OpenType MATH fonts are available.

        [ATK] Missing 'selection-changed' signal when navigating a combo box with keyboard
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133512

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Re-implemented test for combo boxes in terms of addNotificationListener()
        instead of using the (already deprecated) logAccessibilityEvents method,
        and made the test cross platform (as the fix is not platform specific).

        * accessibility/combo-box-collapsed-selection-changed.html:
        Implemented based on the former gtk-only test, and made it cross-platform.
        * accessibility/combo-box-collapsed-selection-changed-expected.txt: New.
        * platform/gtk/accessibility/combo-box-collapsed-selection-changed.html: Removed.
        * platform/gtk/accessibility/combo-box-collapsed-selection-changed-expected.txt: Removed.

        Updated expectation for test that checks that a notification is
        sent when navigating through a multiselection list box, now that
        we are actually printing such a notification.

        * accessibility/multiselect-list-reports-active-option-expected.txt: Updated.

        Removed two expected failures from TestExpectations for tests that
        are now passing, one for the combo box test mentioned above and
        another one for a test that is passing as well now, after applying
        this fix: accessibility/menu-list-sends-change-notification.html

        * platform/gtk/TestExpectations: Removed two 'failure' expectations.

        * platform/mac/TestExpectations: Skip accessiblity test timing out, probably because
        those kind of notifications while navigating a combo box are not needed in the Mac.

        We update the reference for some tests with radicals and enable the tests for addition/removal of children in an msqrt/mroot element.
        We also add a test for bug 126516 (SVG transforms not applied to mroot) and a new test for radical drawing using an OpenType MATH table.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Simplify the named grid lines resolution algorithm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133543

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Added a new test that checks that named grid lines and areas are
        correctly set after dynamically changing them with JS. It also
        verifies that we properly recompute the resolution of named grid
        lines/areas when the positioning properties change.

        Also appended a new test case to verify that explicitly adding
        named lines of the form <foo-start>/<foo-end> effectively creates
        implicit named grid areas so that we could use them in grid
        placement properties (for example -webkit-grid-column: foo).

        No need to add more tests for named grid lines/areas resolution as
        we already have a quite good coverage (the feature was already
        there, we're simplifying/improving the implementation).

        Fix more latched scrolling test flakiness and slowness
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133601

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Latched scrolling tests were flakey for two reasons. First, the EventSender
        wheel events were async from the web to the UI process, and the resulting
        synthetic events also async from the UI to the web process. Make them sync
        for testing.
        
        Secondly, the timer-based scrolling tree commit could result in the scrolling
        tree (specifically the frame node's notion of the scrollable area and content
        size) not being updated before the scrolling thread starts getting wheel events.
        Fix by having WebPage::wheelEventSyncForTesting() commit if necessary.
        
        Finally remove all the now-unnecessary timeouts from the tests.

        Non-toplevel compositing layers are device pixel aligned. In order to render the content
        to the same position as if the layer was not aligned, the graphics layer needs to be translated.
        CALayer::bounds is set to compensate for the shifted layer. However, we should not change the layer's
        size as that stretches the content and results in overlaps/gaps/extra fuzziness.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133488

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Filter effects are not subpixel aware yet. They paint to integrally sized image buffers.
        In order to ensure that the content is rendered to the the same position on the filter 
        source context as if there was no filter, the repaint rects need to be adjusted to match with
        the internal filter snapping (enclosingIntRect).
        This is a temporary change until after filter effects get subpixelized.

        However, this changeset regresses RenderNameFlow clipping when the content is on subpixel position
        and filter effect is present. Instead of adding the failing test cases to TestExpectations, I removed
        the video controls from the <video> to make the tests pass, when possible (they just happen to have <video>)
        and filed webkit.org/b/133523 to track the regression.

        https://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Tools/TestWebKitAPI/Tests/WebKitGtk/testatk.c?rev=166976
        What could not be verified in the same way:

        1. Whether element implements ATK_TEXT. If setCaretOffset
        succeeds, it confirms that element is text as well. But in cases
        when setCaretOffset must fail I see no way to confirm it is text
        element.

        2. Whether position is correct through a call to
        atk_text_get_caret_offset.  text-caret-moved signal value is
        tested instead.

        Anyway these cases don't look crucial, so they are skipped.

        Subpixel rendering: Non-compositing transforms with subpixel coordinates paint to wrong position.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Snapping relative negative coordinate values should produce the same position as if they were
        positive absolute coordinates.
        When a child box gets positioned off of its containers towards top/left, its relative coordinates
        become negative. Pixel snapping those negative values should produce the same
        final painting position as if the child box was fixed positioned with positive coordinates.
        Since halfway values always round away from zero, negative and positive halfway values
        produce opposite rounding direction.
        This patch ensures that negative halfway values round to the direction as if they were positive.

        This first test makes sure that repaint rects are extended to include text decorations that may
        lie outside of the text layout rects. It compares text with an underline to text that has
        had underline applied to it in a timer.

        The second test triggers an off-by-one error in collapsed table borders where a border was not
        being drawn if it lay right on top of a repaint rect.

        JSDOMWindow should not claim HasImpureGetOwnPropertySlot
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132918

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        We now correctly handle the impurity of JSDOMWindow's custom getOwnPropertySlot without needing the 
        blanket HasImpureGetOwnPropertySlot. We do this through the use of watchpoints and by explicitly forbidding
        any caching beyond a certain point using PropertySlot::disableCaching. Getting rid of this flag will allow 
        us to cache many properties/methods on both the JSDOMWindow and its prototype, which are very commonly used 
        across the web.

        These tests trigger inline caching of window and window prototype properties.

        Move subframe name getter lookup later in JSDOMWindow::getOwnPropertySlot
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132922

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        In JSDOMWindow::getOwnPropertySlot, we currently look for the property on the JSDOMWindow, 
        then we search the window's subframes for name getters, then we look in the window's prototype 
        chain. Apparently we were doing the lookup in this order to be compatible with Mozilla, but 
        Mozilla no longer implements this behavior. Instead, they do the lookup on the prototype before 
        looking for subframe name getters. We should change this to match Mozilla. This has the convenient 
        side effect of allowing us to cache lookups in the window's prototype chain.

        Some test cases expect integral values, so the test content is updated accordingly.

        Don't dispatch 'beforeload' event inside FrameView::layout()

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132621
        <rdar://problem/15661470>

        This merges Blink revision 162073 with minor renaming and style
        changes. From that commit:

        Executing JavaScript code inside FrameView::layout() is problematic.
        e.g. an assertion failure tested in fast/events/beforeload-assertion.html.
        We should avoid it.

        This CL makes 'beforeload' event dispatching for plugins and iframes asynchronous,
        except plugin access from JavaScript code (HTMLPlugInElement::
        renderWidgetForJSBindings).

        Subpixel rendering: Empty rects should remain empty after integrally enclosing them.

        <rdar://problem/16846801>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that empty LayoutRects remain empty after converting to integral enclosing rect.
        LayoutRects with fractional position get expanded even if they are empty. This makes rectangle
        operations unreliable and can result in undesired side effects.

        REGRESSION (r168095): 1-pixel gap between adjacent selection inlines
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132474
        <rdar://problem/16797394>

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch changes text selection rectangle calculation from integral to device
        pixel snapping. It ensures that selection rect painting matches box boundaries for inline elements.
        Directional rounding (horizontal only atm) is moved out from Font class and now accessible
        to all the painting code. RTL snapping strategy is changed from floor to round to match ltr behavior.
        However this patch does not address all the integral snapping across inline elements. There are
        a few places where we still calculate enclosing rects where snapping is sufficient.

        Adapt inline SVG sizing behavior to Firefox and Blink
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132569

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The new sizing behavior for inline SVG causes different DRT outputs for about 40 test cases.
        This is expected but for most tests an improvement since the SVGs fit into the documents
        and scrollbars disappear or the general size gets smaller.
        Some tests needed to be updated. The size was either not set at all or not properly.

        svg-in-object.js and svg-inline.js contain dozens of new tests to check the correct sizing
        behavior.

        The tests were written by David Vest from Opera as part of CR 308992.

        Many of the -expected updates are caused by SVG size changes in turn
        affecting where line breaks are inserted.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        This just needed a re-baseline after all. The bounds have increased in size 
        because the size of the layer tree dump effects the bounds! So now that we are 
        printing out anchor points, the bound increase by 15 pixels for every new anchor 
        point print-out.

        Should not longer be marked failing.

        * TestExpectations: Changed expectation from Skip to ImageOnyFailure

2014-05-01  Carlos Alberto Lopez Perez  <clopez@igalia.com>

        [GTK] Unreviewed GTK gardening.
        Rebaseline affected tests by the new multi-column mode that was
        enabled on r168046, and later modified on r168076 and r168088.


        * platform/gtk/TestExpectations: Include two new flaky tests after
        the new multi-colum mode and remove expectations for the ones that
        now pass.

        CSS JIT: backtracking with current / parent element for child
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132057

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Calculate appropriate backtracking start height from the closest
        descendant. And at first, we use it for a simple optimization.

        1. When backtracking start height equals to current height, we
        can simply jump to a descendant element check phase.
        2. When backtracking start height equals to current height + 1, we
        can simply jump to a descendant element traversing phase.

        We can apply this optimization to fragments with adjacent combinators.
        But, in the meantime, we start to implement it for a fragment with
        child combinator.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/167351 introduced an early return when border
        rect is empty. This patch ensures that border image is not painted either in that case.

        * fast/css/padding-margin-negative-border-expected.html: Borders in -expected.html does not get painted either, just
        ensure that they are explicitly different colors.

        Add a test that dumps the event target and the related target of every mouse event
        when dispatched inside an input element inside a details element.

        This catches the regression as well as other bugs I encountered while fixing the bug.

        REGRESSION (r151839): Subframe keeps getting mousemove events with the same coordinates after hiding a hovered element.
        <https://webkit.org/b/131974>
        <rdar://problem/15907469>

        Add a test that triggers the weirdness where removing the renderer from
        a hovered element in a subframe would leave the subframe's EventHandler
        in a state where it could dispatch fake mousemove events with stale
        coordinates in response to style recalc.

        Note that the final 500ms delay is because fake mousemove events are
        sent on 250ms delay timers so we need to give it some time to catch up.

        Second, skipping was ineffective anyway, because we had a preceding [ Pass Failure ]

        The test was originally skipped in Bug 89812 due to flakiness on Chromium
        debug bots. I run the tests with huge iterations and I don't see
        flakiness on Mavericks release/debug. Let's remove from skipped for now.

        Remove references to Leopard and Snow Leopard from Windows TestExpectations

        Filed new bugs to track each of these tests, so someone with a windows
        build can try and see if the tests still fail.

        Unreviewed.

        Make sure to skip the RenderMultiColumnFlowThread when resolving percentage heights inside columns against
        containing blocks. The flow thread's auto height should not interfere if a fixed height is specified on
        an ancestor.

        Wrote a bunch of tests. A few of the tests were copied from existing
        (old-impl) tests and put in a separate directory. That directory can
        be wiped when we turn on the new multicol implementation by default.

        Subpixel rendering: WK1: Trail of cruft in redraw during animations.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131525

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Use enclosing rect instead of snapping to make sure the repaint rect always
        covers the dirty area when painting is requested in a non-compositing RenderView.
        This only applies to WK1 as WK2 has compositing RenderView and the repainting 
        is managed by RenderLayerBacking.

        This is a temporary solution until after ScrollView/FrameView/RenderView
        is transitioned to device pixels. (tracked here: webkit.org/b/131526).

        so we won't run into rounding problems, and we don't have that big test set, which would require an expected
        result generation. We can add it later, if we extend the test set. The logic is similar to the non margin test case.

            VisibleSelection::visibleStart() and VisibleSelection::visibleEnd()
            can both cause layouts, which has the potential to invalidate any
            rendertree-based objects. This was causing a problem in
            FrameSelection::directionOfSelection(), where a reference to a
            lineBox was being held across a call to visibleEnd().

            This patch ensures that the any layout is completed before linebox
            references are retrieved.

        [CSSRegions] Crash when cloning a region child with a content node child
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129811

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Collecting the children of a region in another named flow will be supported
        again in the future and it will be revisited when we will implement the content
        keyword: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-regions-1/#the-flow-into-property.
        For now, skip the tests for that use case.

            The test doesn't use magnitude-perf.js as this requires a relatively long-running test function and
            it seemed unsuitable for that.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Prevent issues with checkLayout() in grid items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130770

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        When we use checkLayout() on a grid item, the results (PASS or FAIL
        messages) are added as new auto-placed items in the grid. Which might
        cause some unexpected behavior in the tests.

        This patch modifies the related layout tests to use a different
        container (usually the parent node of the grid) for the test results.
        Avoiding any kind of interference with the grid code.

        InlineIterator position (unsigned int) variable can wrap around
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130540

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This test triggers an ASSERT that occurs when we are ignoring spaces (to collapse them
        into a single whitespace mark) but then encounter a line break. Because we don't ignore
        the first space (but do ignore subsequent spaces), when we hit a newline in an RTL context
        we want to ignore that first space as well (so as not to push the text away from the right
        edge). We do this by decrementing the InlineIterator pointing to this first space, so all
        the spaces get ignored. However, if that space is the first character in a Text node, the
        decrement will try to go past the beginning of the node, and trigger an ASSERT.

        This design is not great. At some point we should rework it to more elegantly handle
        collapsing whitespace in both RTL and LTR writing modes.

        Subpixel rendering: RenderBox is positioned off by one when non-compositing transform is present.

         }

         The <div> with (10.25px, 10.25px) is painted to (10.5px, 10.5px) after device pixel snapping on 2x display.
         Moving <div> to its own RenderLayer should not change the painting position.

             left: 10.25px;
             -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);
         }

        When we paint the RenderLayer's content, the graphics context is translated by the rounded value of
        renderer's offset from parent.

            (10.25px,10.25px) -> rounded to (10.5px,10.5px).

        When the translate moves the graphics context's origin over the renderer's top-left position,
        the renderer's relative top-left coordinates end up being negative.

            Graphics context translated by (10.5px,10.5px) -> pushes renderer's relative top-left coords to (-0.25px,-0.25px)

        When we round (pixel snap) these negative coordinates, half-way values get translated to the wrong direction.

        (relative coords (-0.25px,-0.25px) -> pixel snapped to (-0.5px,-0.5px) -> final absolute(painting) coords (10px,10px))

        This patch changes the rounding to flooring to ensure that the relative top-left position never gets negative as the result
        of subpixel shifting.

        Web Inspector: add frontend controller and models for replay sessions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130145

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Add tests for existing nondeterministic inputs handled in JSC.
        They are skipped for all platforms until WEB_REPLAY is enabled.

        The new mechanism here is the single-segment replay reftest. It will
        load the test page once to inject test code into the inspector. Then,
        the reftest will reload the test page and start capturing. The test
        page performs some nondeterministic computation before the load event.
        Then, the inspector test dumps the computed nondeterministic state.
        Capturing is stopped, and the session is replayed once. When the load
        event fires on the replayed page execution, the nondeterministic states
        from capturing and replaying are compared. They should be the same.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.

        Subpixel accumulation through nesting (absolute positioning, 2x display):
        non-compositing case:
        (nested boxes)  (layout pos) (norm.paint pos) (translate accumulation, subpixel accumulation, final paint pos)
        div -> top: 1.3px   1.3px     1.5px      1.5px 0.2px -> snapped 0.0px -> 1.5px
         div -> top: 1.3px   2.6px     2.5px      3.0px 0.4px -> snapped 0.5px -> 2.5px
          div -> top: 1.3px   3.9px     4.0px      4.5px 0.6px -> snapped 0.5px -> 4.0px
           div -> top: 1.3px   5.2px     5.0px      6.0px 0.8px -> snapped 1.0px -> 5.0px

        compositing case:
        (nested boxes)  (layout pos) (norm.paint pos) (device pixel offset + fractional offset, final pos)
        div -> top: 1.3px   1.3px      1.5px      1.0px + 0.3px -> snapped -> 1.5px
         div -> top: 1.3px   2.6px      2.5px      2.5px + 0.1px -> snapped -> 2.5px
          div -> top: 1.3px   3.9px      4.0px      3.5px + 0.4px -> snapped -> 4.0px

        Subpixel rendering: Nested layers with subpixel accumulation paint to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.
        
        Compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> floored painting position (0, 0)
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2), 
        but the actual painting offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of parent flooring.
        
        Non-compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> GraphicsContext is translated to (0, 0).
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2)
        but the GraphicsContext's offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of the parent's translate.   

        In both cases, without the subpixel adjustment, we'd paint the current layer at (10.0, 10.0)
        after flooring, while its painting position is actually (10.5, 10.5).
        Subpixels do accumulate through nested layers.

        Static property tables are currently duplicated on first use from read-only memory into dirty memory
        in every process, and since the entries are large (48 bytes) and the tables can be unusually sparse
        (we use a custom hash table without a rehash) a lot of memory may be wasted.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that both the simple and non-simple cases paint to the same position.
        Simple compositing container layer codepath needs to take the fractional device pixel offset
        into account when painting. Without the fractional value, the final paint rounding could push the
        paint offset to a different position.
        retina example:
        compositing top-left: 0px 0px.
        fractional offset: 0.3px 0.3px
        painting coords without offseting: 0px 0px

            The root cause is CompositeEditCommand::moveParagraphWithClones() passing
            two positions |start| and |end| which do not follow the document order,
            i.e. in some situations |start| is located after |end| because of
            the difference in affinity.

            This patch fixes this crash by normalizing |end| to |start| in such situations.
            It also adds an ASSERT that checks the relationship between |start| and |end|.

        outlineBoundsForRepaint() is expected to return the outline repaint rect. Using enclosingIntRect()
        to calculate the outline boundaries breaks repaint logic in RenderElement::repaintAfterLayoutIfNeeded().
        Since enclosingIntRect() can return bigger rect than repaint rect, the old/new bounds' dimensions could end up
        being different which triggers the size change repaint code path.

        This test renders large text with a double underline, but then barely clips off the bottom underline
        using overflow: hidden. It makes sure that this is exactly the same as a single underline. If the
        space between the two underlines does not scale with font size, it will appear as though there is a
        single thick underline (because they will be drawn on top of each other) and will thus fail this test.

        Ensure keySplines is valid in SMIL animations

        <rdar://problem/15676128>

        http://crbug.com/276111

            This patch fixes a crash in SMIL animations when keySplines are not
            specified. The SMIL spec is clear on this:
            http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncCalcMode
            "If there are any errors in the keyTimes specification (bad values,
            too many or too few values), the animation will have no effect."

            This patch simply checks that keyTimes is not empty. Previously,
            splinesCount was set to be m_keySplines.size() + 1 in
            SVGAnimationElement.cpp; this patch changes splinesCount to be equal
            to m_keySplines.size() to make the logic easier to follow and to
            match other checks in SVGAnimationElement::startedActiveInterval.

        Filters should test for area instead of single dimension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123716

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        A filtered SVG element with a sigle dimension bigger than 5000
        (counting the margin/border) will fail to render. So an element
        with 4000x4000 will render fine, while another with 5000x10
        won't. This patch instead tests against the total element area,
        which fixes such cases.

        The current patch fixes the rendering issue and at same time,
        fixes some layer violations where FilterEffectRenderer and
        RenderSVGResourceFilter were directly accessing the kMax value
        in FilterEffect. Since before a somewhat bigger filter would
        be aborted, it required to change the maximum kernel size
        for blur filter (some filters are slower to run than others for
        bigger SVGs).

        This test changes the page scale factor to a very large value, simulating
        the user zooming in with a trackpad. It then positions the viewport
        to a place where the underline should not be drawn. It then compares this
        to a completely white page.

        This explanation cannot be in the test itself because the test sets the
        scale factor too high for the tester to be able to read text.

        Refactoring inline_spelling_markers.html to use asynchronous spellchecking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=127284

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Use asynchronous text checking in inline-spelling-markers.html and
        inline-spelling-markers-hidpi.html

        Rename the test to inline-spelling-markers.html to match the naming convention.

        * editing/spelling/inline-spelling-markers-expected.txt: Added.
        Make cross platform text expectation by dumping spelling/grammar markers
        instead of whole tree which in terms of spellchecking says nothing.

        * editing/spelling/inline-spelling-markers.html: Added.
        Remove unnecessary new lines from div elements so position of markers can be given from 0.
        Activate text checking by adding a word separator so WebKit starts performing spell and grammar
        checking. Selection change does not invoke grammar checking unless we start editing the input
        element's content.

        [CSS Blending] An element having -webkit-mix-blend-mode should only blend with the contents of the parent stacking context
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129154

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Test that isolation is performed for blending, in other words, an element having -webkit-mix-blend-mode is blending with the
        contents of the parent stacking context, but not with any of the underlying content.

        The test col-and-colgroup-offsets.html is failing on the Apple Win Debug (Tests) bot due

        Add tests for regions in multi-column elements and a test that verifies

        For the non horizontal-tb writing modes tests there's no overflow after the
