        Precision errors in Math.cbrt() on GTK, EFL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123624

        Reviewed by Csaba Osztrogonác.

        Calculate cube roots of 8 and -8, expecting 2 and -2, respectively. Cube roots of those two
        numbers don't contain precision errors on the GTK and EFL ports as is the case with 27 and -27.

        [EFL][WK1] Some tests of editing/selection fail to render properly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117574

        Unreviewed, EFL gardening.

        These tests are passed in wk1(and wk2), but skipped in wk1.
        These tests have been reviewed since those are added.
        Now these tests are operating properly, so those need to update the test expectations.
        Also 'editing/selection/caret-and-focus-ring.html' is already changed a reason of failure by Bug no.123696

        Initial implementation of text-decoration-skip ink
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121806

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Adding a test which draws a very large "p" with text-decoration-skip:ink. The
        viewport is restricted to be just hugging the place where an underline would
        intersect the descender of the "p". This should look the same as if there was
        no underline at all (because of the skipping underline).

        WebPageCreationParameters should be consistent in Window.open
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123557

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        When Window.open in called in WebKit2 the WebProcess sends a synchronous request to open
        a page (WebPageProxy::createNewPage). The UIProcess creates a WebpageProxy, and responds
        with instructions to the WebProcess to create the WebPage. The initial creation state of
        the WebPage is communicated to the WebProcess via two routes (firstly an asynchronous
        WebProcess::CreateWebPage message, and secondly in the synchronous response from
        WebPageProxy::createNewPage). Unfortunately these responses are inconsistent with each
        other. The creationParameters() for the page are calculated twice, and since the WKView
        will be added to a window between the async message being sent and the synchronous reply
        being returned the visibility state of the page can change.

        To fix the inconsistency we can set the creation parameters at the point that the
        WebPageProxy is instantiated. This will result in a functional change that is web
        visible, since the page will initially be opened in a hidden/blurred state, and may
        later become visible/focussed. This change is consistent with the direction we want to
        evolve in. Whilst we will still probably require a synchronous message from the
        WebProcess to the UIProcess on Window.open, we'll probably make this return much earlier
        – having just created the WebPageProxy, but avoiding blocking the WebProcess over the
        client delegate callback that opens the new window.

        This fix results in a layout test result change, due to the change in behavior (page is
        created blurred, and becomes focussed, resulting in a focus event being fired – rather
        than the window opening directly into a focussed state). This is reported as a
        progression (test is broken in WebKit1, fixed in WebKit2 after this change). In reality
        the test is actually slightly broken in DRT/test-runner – the test runs differently than
        in browser, since there is is no visible main window. In-browser this patch results in
        no change in behavior on dom/Window/mozilla-focus-blur.html (the affected test).

              Update so that the <span> elements being used don't have tabindex, which forces them to be in the AX tree,
              which changes the output of the test (basically we'd need to query the child of those elements instead).

        [CSSRegions] Display anonymous regions in DRT

        After https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119135, css regions are modelled using an anonymous
        RenderNamedFlowFragment object inside the block having a valid -webkit-flow-from.
        This patch changes the way elements | pseudo-elements with -webkit-flow-from are displayed
        in test dumps.

        Changed expected files for mac port, removed expectations for gtk | efl and added [Missing]
        in TestExpectations for these platforms. Results need to be generated again for the [Missing] lines.

        [CSS Regions] Rename CSS classes and JS methods in vertical layout tests about selection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123327

        classes and JS methods related to the selection layout tests for CSS
        Regions.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123304

        The focus-option-control-on-page.html test has behavior that depends on the system
        "Full Keyboard Access" prefs, so mark it as passing or failing, and remove a bogus
        result that I added.

        * platform/mac-mountainlion/platform/mac/fast/forms/focus-option-control-on-page-expected.txt: Removed.

        Revert <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/157893>
        (Mavericks test results mega-patch).

        It didn't fix Mavericks, which still has dozens of failures, and it broke Mountain
        Lion bots, which need to remain green for tools like EWS to work.

        At a glance, there are multiple systemic issues with this change:
        - some results went to broken locations like platform/mac/platform/mac/editing/spelling/autocorrection-at-beginning-of-word-1-expected.png;
        - WK2 expectations also went to platform/mac/platform/mac-wk2/TestExpectations.
        - some tests like js/dom/global-constructors-attributes.html used to match cross-platform
        baseline, but copying Mavericks results over to platform/mac made it so that those results
        are now ignored on Mountain Lion.

        I think that starting over will be easier that fixing these issues incrementally.

        Add support for the column-fill property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117693

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        With column-fill support, a lot of multicol tests needed an update.
        The old implementation behaved as if column-fill were 'auto', but the
        initial value is 'balance', so now we need to be explicit about that.
        For auto-height tests it doesn't really matter - such multicols are always
        balanced anyway.

        Unexpected word wrapping for wrapped content then raw content.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121130

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        When deciding whether a line is considered empty, we need to check if the current
        object is fully responsible for the currently uncommitted width. It helps differentiating
        <span></span><span>abcd</span> from <span>a</span><span>bcd</span>, where in the first
        case when we hit the second <span> the line is still considered empty, as opposed to the
        second example.

        From Blink r155397 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>

        Added a new test case to check bad grid items resolution with two
        opposite span positions. Also added a real grid container to check
        also the resolution code path in some other tests.
