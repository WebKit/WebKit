        Ensure the render style's wordSpacing can be set correctly when the type of
        the new value is 'Calculated'. The 'Calculated' Length value can result from
        blending two Length values of different types. And these two Length values
        are defined in two consecutive css animation key frames.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Make sure that setting the CSS style wordSpacing property to very huge percentage
        value and blending this value with other values for animating key frames does
        not assert or crash. The expectation is to have this huge value to be clamped to
        the pre-defined min/max values for the CSS length type. So when blending the clamped
        value with other wordSpacing values, the result can't be NaN. This should be very
        similar to the case when it is set to a huge <length> value.

        RenderMathMLUnderOver adds spacing to the child operator indefinitely when zooming or resizing the window.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137330

        Reviewed by Darin Adler, Daniel Bates.

        When the alignment is center, which is the common case for math, changing the size of
        an object affects the position of this object also.  We need to confirm that zooming or
        resizing the window should not affect the rectangle of the over/under math object operator.

        * mathml/opentype/munderover-window-resize.html: Added.
        New test with many under and over math objects.  After loading the page, the window is resized and
        the view is zoomed in and out to make sure the layout of these under and over objects were not changed.
        * platform/mac/mathml/opentype/opentype-stretchy-horizontal-expected.txt:
        This test was wrong because of the spacing issue. The page has two <mover> math objects at the beginning.
        Each of them has an <mspace> child. The width of the first <mspace> is 1em while the width of the second
        <mspace> is 2em. The font size is 10pt. So it is expected to have the first one 10 pixels and the second 
        to be 20 pixels. In the test, the width of the first is 22 and the width of the second is 32.
        I do expect this test to fail on other platforms since they have the same mistake which is now fixed. I am
        going to submit the mac expected version only and when it fails I am going to collect the result and submit
        another patch for the other platforms expected files.

        When SubSelector comes, `inAdjacentChain` flag is cleared to false.
        So for example, `document.querySelector("span#id + ok")` doesn't work correctly.

        Re-add the request autocomplete feature

        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136730>

        This feature was rolled out in r148731 because it was only used by
        Chromium. As we consider supporting this feature, roll it back in, but
        leave it disabled.

        This rolls out r148731 (which removed the feature) with small changes
        needed to make the code build in ToT, to match modern style, to make
        the tests run, and to remove unused code.

        Now that we return "flex" instead of "-webkit-flex" (and similar
        changes) update the tests that rely on this. Other than that,
        we're still testing the prefixed content. A followup patch

        This test used a fake timeout handler, which is not needed, because WRT/WKTR do it for you.
        Any time the test took over 2 seconds, we would dump and disable waiting for notifyDone,
        but the test would still try to open windows after that.

        Update placeholder-shown-basics.html for GTK

        GTK does not support the color input type. This was causing placeholder-shown-basics.html
        to fail when testing the non-support of placeholder by input[type=color].

        Since this is a minor part of the test, it is more valuable getting the test running everywhere
        than skipping it. I removed the subtest causing troubles.

        Add tests covering the basic cases: classes and attributes.

        First-child covers the basic positional updates.

        The tests have a version without any indirect adjacent ("~") because the marking
        used for those is much more generic and having them hide some bugs.

        Some tests are still failing. That is due to the style resolver not handling
        direct siblings ("+") correctly when there are multiple of them. I will address
        that separately.

        REGRESSION(r168256): JSString can get 8-bit flag wrong when re-using AtomicStrings.
        <https://webkit.org/b/133574>
        <rdar://problem/18051847>

        Add a tests that creates a 16-bit AtomicString with only 8-bit characters,
        then tiers up into baseline JIT and uses that string as part of a rope-within-a-rope
        and serializes that rope to get an incorrect concatenation.

        When the style change requires both layout and repaint, the style diff is set to
        'layout is needed' (and masks the repaint change) as normally layout is followed by a repaint.
        However, in compositing context, layout may not be followed by repaint, so when the style diff
        indicates layout, we need to figure out whether it implies repaint too.
        This logic should eventually be moved from RenderElement to RenderLayerModelObject/RenderLayer.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Since we don't control the transformed context painting's snapping strategy, our best bet to fully
        include the transformed box when requesting for repaint is to use enclosing.
        Pixelsnapping doesn't work here for all cases. For example, a scaled box at 0.8px can be anti-aliased painted
        both at 0.5px and 1px, while with pixelsnapping we'd expect it to be painted starting from 1px;

            EcmaScript 5.1 specifies that during for-in enumeration newly added properties may or may not be

        Subpixel rendering: InlineTextBox mistakenly rounds offset value before painting.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135470

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch removes the premature paint offset adjustment for inlines. Premature snapping
        could alter the final painting coordinates and push content to wrong positions.

        This patch also enforces WebCore's pixel snapping strategy (round) on text painting.
        It ensures that text positioning is in sync with other painting related operations including
        clipping, box decorations etc. Underlying graphics libraries can take different directions on
        text snapping, for example CG ceils text coordinates vertically (in horizontal context,
        with the current settings). It can lead to undesired side effects.

        CSS: Fix :visited behavior for SubSelectors

        Disable :visited match for the selectors that has SubSelectors.
        This `isSubSelector` (`context.firstSelectorOfTheFragment == context.selector`) is intended to
        check `relation != CSSSelector::SubSelector`.
        But since this value belongs to the previous selector and it is tested inside the branch that checks
        the next selector isn't SubSelector `relation != CSSSelector::SubSelector`,
        this only matches when the previous selector doesn't has SubSelectors.

        Subpixel rendering: Rounded rect gets non-renderable at certain subpixel size.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135314
        <rdar://problem/17812921>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        While calculating the rounded rect for painting, the radius is adjusted to compensate
        for the pixel snapped size. However while scaling the radius, certain values overflow
        (float) mantissa and it produces a non-renderable rounded rect where the radius becomes bigger
        than the rectangle dimensions. In such cases, we need to shrink the radius to make it
        renderable again.

        it produces a local failure. So if the other selectors are matched against the element, whole ":-webkit-any" succeeds.

        Using debug() interprets strings like "<array of size 0>" as markup, thereby not

        Turn width/height to presentation attributes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135046

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We already had a lot of tests for animating width/height as property.
        So far they assumed that this is not possible. They simply needed to
        be updated.

        Furthermore, I added reference tests to test different inheritance
        scenarios of CSS properties and setting them to elements.

        A parsing test makes sure that the global property values inherit is
        supported as well as CSS parsing rules for SVG attributes.
        Negative tests test not-allowed behavior.

        The cliprect coming from the graphics layer needs to be adjusted with the subpixel gap
        from renderer. This is symmetric with the offsetting we do, when the dirty rect is sent off to the GraphicsLayer.
        It puts us back to the correct coordinating system for intersecting with renderers.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The compositing layer boundaries are calculated using its renderer()'s and the renderer()'s
        descendants' bounds. However when the renderer() is zero sized, its bounds are omitted.
        In such cases, when the child content has offset from the renderer(), the subpixel adjustment
        of the compositing layer becomes negative (-meaning that the compositing layer is to the right/bottom
        direction from its renderer()). Remove fabs() to be able to express such direction.

        <rdar://problem/17530298>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch removes 2 integral roundings from InlineFlowBox:
        1. Border and padding sizes are implicitly integral truncated by the 'int' return type
           of borderLogicalLeft/Right()/paddingLogicalLeft/Right(). It results in losing
           fractional border/padding values.
        2. Painting rectangle is explicitly rounded which pushes border and
           other decoration elements to odd device pixel positions on retina displays.
        These values get pixel snapped right before calling in to GraphicsContext::*.

        To make it works correctly, add the positionInRootFragments field to SelectorFragment.
        When positionInRootFragments == Rightmost and relationToRightFragment == Rightmost,

        Remove latinmodern-math.woff from LayoutTests/mathml/opentype
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134094

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        We remove latinmodern-math.woff from the source and make mathml/opentype/*LatinModern* tests not font-specific, so that each platform will use whatever OpenType MATH is available.
        Until bug 133604 is fixed and Latin Modern Math installed on the Linux bots, the tests are marked as failed. More generally, we need to fix bug 133603.
        The test mathml/opentype/roots-LatinModern is removed since it will duplicate mathml/presentation/roots.xhtml when OpenType MATH fonts are available.

        Simply dump the render tree of a page that includes Khmer and Lao text. The success
        of this test depends on font font metrics being different than system fallback font
        (which just shows rectangles instead of glyphs).

        Re-implemented test for combo boxes in terms of addNotificationListener()
        instead of using the (already deprecated) logAccessibilityEvents method,
        and made the test cross platform (as the fix is not platform specific).

        REGRESSION (r167937): Do not use effective zoom factor while resolving media query's min-, max-(device)width/height values.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133681

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We lost the default multiplier(zoom) value of 1 with r167937 at template<typename T> T computeLength().
        Now MediaQueryEvaluator takes the current page zoom factor into account while resolving min-, max- width values.

        This patch explicitly sets the multiplier value to 1 to ensure zoom independent media query value resolving.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Simplify the named grid lines resolution algorithm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133543

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Added a new test that checks that named grid lines and areas are
        correctly set after dynamically changing them with JS. It also
        verifies that we properly recompute the resolution of named grid
        lines/areas when the positioning properties change.

        Also appended a new test case to verify that explicitly adding
        named lines of the form <foo-start>/<foo-end> effectively creates
        implicit named grid areas so that we could use them in grid
        placement properties (for example -webkit-grid-column: foo).

        No need to add more tests for named grid lines/areas resolution as
        we already have a quite good coverage (the feature was already
        there, we're simplifying/improving the implementation).

        Fix more latched scrolling test flakiness and slowness
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133601

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Latched scrolling tests were flakey for two reasons. First, the EventSender
        wheel events were async from the web to the UI process, and the resulting
        synthetic events also async from the UI to the web process. Make them sync
        for testing.
        
        Secondly, the timer-based scrolling tree commit could result in the scrolling
        tree (specifically the frame node's notion of the scrollable area and content
        size) not being updated before the scrolling thread starts getting wheel events.
        Fix by having WebPage::wheelEventSyncForTesting() commit if necessary.
        
        Finally remove all the now-unnecessary timeouts from the tests.

        Non-toplevel compositing layers are device pixel aligned. In order to render the content
        to the same position as if the layer was not aligned, the graphics layer needs to be translated.
        CALayer::bounds is set to compensate for the shifted layer. However, we should not change the layer's
        size as that stretches the content and results in overlaps/gaps/extra fuzziness.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        I have changed the "invalid-descriptor" test and removed the "invalid
        inputs correct src" test to reflect the fact that invalid descriptors
        are now treated identically to null descriptors. That is according to
        the spec.
        I've also added new tests that make sure that the spec's future
        compatible changes are working.

        Subpixel rendering: Buttons in default media controls shift vertically when controls fade in or out.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133488

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Filter effects are not subpixel aware yet. They paint to integrally sized image buffers.
        In order to ensure that the content is rendered to the the same position on the filter 
        source context as if there was no filter, the repaint rects need to be adjusted to match with
        the internal filter snapping (enclosingIntRect).
        This is a temporary change until after filter effects get subpixelized.

        However, this changeset regresses RenderNameFlow clipping when the content is on subpixel position
        and filter effect is present. Instead of adding the failing test cases to TestExpectations, I removed
        the video controls from the <video> to make the tests pass, when possible (they just happen to have <video>)
        and filed webkit.org/b/133523 to track the regression.

        The tests are replicated from testatk.c file, functions

        What could not be verified in the same way:

        1. Whether element implements ATK_TEXT. If setCaretOffset
        succeeds, it confirms that element is text as well. But in cases
        when setCaretOffset must fail I see no way to confirm it is text
        element.

        2. Whether position is correct through a call to
        atk_text_get_caret_offset.  text-caret-moved signal value is
        tested instead.

        Anyway these cases don't look crucial, so they are skipped.

        Subpixel rendering: Non-compositing transforms with subpixel coordinates paint to wrong position.

        <rdar://problem/16745606>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Snapping relative negative coordinate values should produce the same position as if they were
        positive absolute coordinates.
        When a child box gets positioned off of its containers towards top/left, its relative coordinates
        become negative. Pixel snapping those negative values should produce the same
        final painting position as if the child box was fixed positioned with positive coordinates.
        Since halfway values always round away from zero, negative and positive halfway values
        produce opposite rounding direction.
        This patch ensures that negative halfway values round to the direction as if they were positive.

        Text decorations do not contribute to visual overflow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132773

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This first test makes sure that repaint rects are extended to include text decorations that may
        lie outside of the text layout rects. It compares text with an underline to text that has
        had underline applied to it in a timer.

        The second test triggers an off-by-one error in collapsed table borders where a border was not
        being drawn if it lay right on top of a repaint rect.

        'loadedmetadata' and 'loadstart' events.

        JSDOMWindow should not claim HasImpureGetOwnPropertySlot
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132918

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        We now correctly handle the impurity of JSDOMWindow's custom getOwnPropertySlot without needing the 
        blanket HasImpureGetOwnPropertySlot. We do this through the use of watchpoints and by explicitly forbidding
        any caching beyond a certain point using PropertySlot::disableCaching. Getting rid of this flag will allow 
        us to cache many properties/methods on both the JSDOMWindow and its prototype, which are very commonly used 
        across the web.

        These tests trigger inline caching of window and window prototype properties.

        Move subframe name getter lookup later in JSDOMWindow::getOwnPropertySlot
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132922

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        In JSDOMWindow::getOwnPropertySlot, we currently look for the property on the JSDOMWindow, 
        then we search the window's subframes for name getters, then we look in the window's prototype 
        chain. Apparently we were doing the lookup in this order to be compatible with Mozilla, but 
        Mozilla no longer implements this behavior. Instead, they do the lookup on the prototype before 
        looking for subframe name getters. We should change this to match Mozilla. This has the convenient 
        side effect of allowing us to cache lookups in the window's prototype chain.

        Don't dispatch 'beforeload' event inside FrameView::layout()

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132621
        <rdar://problem/15661470>

        This merges Blink revision 162073 with minor renaming and style
        changes. From that commit:

        Executing JavaScript code inside FrameView::layout() is problematic.
        e.g. an assertion failure tested in fast/events/beforeload-assertion.html.
        We should avoid it.

        This CL makes 'beforeload' event dispatching for plugins and iframes asynchronous,
        except plugin access from JavaScript code (HTMLPlugInElement::
        renderWidgetForJSBindings).

        Subpixel rendering: Empty rects should remain empty after integrally enclosing them.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132753
        <rdar://problem/16846801>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that empty LayoutRects remain empty after converting to integral enclosing rect.
        LayoutRects with fractional position get expanded even if they are empty. This makes rectangle
        operations unreliable and can result in undesired side effects.

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch changes text selection rectangle calculation from integral to device
        pixel snapping. It ensures that selection rect painting matches box boundaries for inline elements.
        Directional rounding (horizontal only atm) is moved out from Font class and now accessible
        to all the painting code. RTL snapping strategy is changed from floor to round to match ltr behavior.
        However this patch does not address all the integral snapping across inline elements. There are
        a few places where we still calculate enclosing rects where snapping is sufficient.

        This test does not verify autocorrection feature which is only implemented
        by Mac. Other WebKit ports might be interested in running it due to
        verification of spelling markers after merging two misspelled words.

        Additionally, add the test case confirming spelling markers
        before any selection change.

        Adapt inline SVG sizing behavior to Firefox and Blink
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132569

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The new sizing behavior for inline SVG causes different DRT outputs for about 40 test cases.
        This is expected but for most tests an improvement since the SVGs fit into the documents
        and scrollbars disappear or the general size gets smaller.
        Some tests needed to be updated. The size was either not set at all or not properly.

        svg-in-object.js and svg-inline.js contain dozens of new tests to check the correct sizing
        behavior.

        The tests were written by David Vest from Opera as part of CR 308992.

        Many of the -expected updates are caused by SVG size changes in turn
        affecting where line breaks are inserted.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        This just needed a re-baseline after all. The bounds have increased in size 
        because the size of the layer tree dump effects the bounds! So now that we are 
        printing out anchor points, the bound increase by 15 pixels for every new anchor 
        point print-out.

        Should not longer be marked failing.

        CSS JIT: backtracking with current / parent element for child
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132057

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Calculate appropriate backtracking start height from the closest
        descendant. And at first, we use it for a simple optimization.

        1. When backtracking start height equals to current height, we
        can simply jump to a descendant element check phase.
        2. When backtracking start height equals to current height + 1, we
        can simply jump to a descendant element traversing phase.

        We can apply this optimization to fragments with adjacent combinators.
        But, in the meantime, we start to implement it for a fragment with
        child combinator.

        REGRESSION (r151839): Subframe keeps getting mousemove events with the same coordinates after hiding a hovered element.
        <https://webkit.org/b/131974>
        <rdar://problem/15907469>

        Add a test that triggers the weirdness where removing the renderer from
        a hovered element in a subframe would leave the subframe's EventHandler
        in a state where it could dispatch fake mousemove events with stale
        coordinates in response to style recalc.

        Note that the final 500ms delay is because fake mousemove events are
        sent on 250ms delay timers so we need to give it some time to catch up.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Use enclosing rect instead of snapping to make sure the repaint rect always
        covers the dirty area when painting is requested in a non-compositing RenderView.
        This only applies to WK1 as WK2 has compositing RenderView and the repainting 
        is managed by RenderLayerBacking.

        This is a temporary solution until after ScrollView/FrameView/RenderView
        is transitioned to device pixels. (tracked here: webkit.org/b/131526).

        Updating test to make sure initial selection respects the focused element when necessary. Now, if a VoiceOver user attempts to use
        arrow keys to read text and selection isn't set, we will set initial selection before/after the focused element if one is present.

        The x attribute must return the x-coordinate.
        If style is not updated when x() is called, it can’t return anything.
        Style and layout should be done before getting value for x() and y().

        so we won't run into rounding problems, and we don't have that big test set, which would require an expected
        result generation. We can add it later, if we extend the test set. The logic is similar to the non margin test case.

            VisibleSelection::visibleStart() and VisibleSelection::visibleEnd()
            can both cause layouts, which has the potential to invalidate any

            FrameSelection::directionOfSelection(), where a reference to a
            lineBox was being held across a call to visibleEnd().

            This patch ensures that the any layout is completed before linebox

        [CSS Grid Layout] getComputedStyle() must return the specified value for positioning properties
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130010

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Updated the return value of getComputedStyle(), it must be always
        the specified value.

        Added also a new test that verifies the resolution of names in
        grid positioning properties, both grid area names and grid line
        names (including any combination of the two).

        [CSS Grid Layout] Prevent issues with checkLayout() in grid items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130770

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        When we use checkLayout() on a grid item, the results (PASS or FAIL
        messages) are added as new auto-placed items in the grid. Which might
        cause some unexpected behavior in the tests.

        This patch modifies the related layout tests to use a different
        container (usually the parent node of the grid) for the test results.
        Avoiding any kind of interference with the grid code.

        InlineIterator position (unsigned int) variable can wrap around
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130540

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This test triggers an ASSERT that occurs when we are ignoring spaces (to collapse them
        into a single whitespace mark) but then encounter a line break. Because we don't ignore
        the first space (but do ignore subsequent spaces), when we hit a newline in an RTL context
        we want to ignore that first space as well (so as not to push the text away from the right
        edge). We do this by decrementing the InlineIterator pointing to this first space, so all
        the spaces get ignored. However, if that space is the first character in a Text node, the
        decrement will try to go past the beginning of the node, and trigger an ASSERT.

        This design is not great. At some point we should rework it to more elegantly handle
        collapsing whitespace in both RTL and LTR writing modes.

        Subpixel rendering: RenderBox is positioned off by one when non-compositing transform is present.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130430

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        div {
            position: absolute;
             top: 10.25px;
             left: 10.25px;
         }

         The <div> with (10.25px, 10.25px) is painted to (10.5px, 10.5px) after device pixel snapping on 2x display.
         Moving <div> to its own RenderLayer should not change the painting position.

         div {
             position: absolute;
             top: 10.25px;
             left: 10.25px;
             -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);
         }

        When we paint the RenderLayer's content, the graphics context is translated by the rounded value of
        renderer's offset from parent.

            (10.25px,10.25px) -> rounded to (10.5px,10.5px).

        When the translate moves the graphics context's origin over the renderer's top-left position,
        the renderer's relative top-left coordinates end up being negative.

            Graphics context translated by (10.5px,10.5px) -> pushes renderer's relative top-left coords to (-0.25px,-0.25px)

        When we round (pixel snap) these negative coordinates, half-way values get translated to the wrong direction.

        (relative coords (-0.25px,-0.25px) -> pixel snapped to (-0.5px,-0.5px) -> final absolute(painting) coords (10px,10px))

        This patch changes the rounding to flooring to ensure that the relative top-left position never gets negative as the result
        of subpixel shifting.

        Web Inspector: add frontend controller and models for replay sessions

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Add tests for existing nondeterministic inputs handled in JSC.
        They are skipped for all platforms until WEB_REPLAY is enabled.

        The new mechanism here is the single-segment replay reftest. It will
        load the test page once to inject test code into the inspector. Then,
        the reftest will reload the test page and start capturing. The test
        page performs some nondeterministic computation before the load event.
        Then, the inspector test dumps the computed nondeterministic state.
        Capturing is stopped, and the session is replayed once. When the load
        event fires on the replayed page execution, the nondeterministic states
        from capturing and replaying are compared. They should be the same.

        Subpixel rendering: Nested layers with subpixel accumulation paint to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.

        non-compositing case:
        (nested boxes)  (layout pos) (norm.paint pos) (translate accumulation, subpixel accumulation, final paint pos)

        Keeping the old radius value could make rounded rectangle non-renderable, because the
        originally calculated radius length does not fit the snapped rectangle anymore.

        Subpixel rendering: Nested layers with subpixel accumulation paint to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.
        
        Compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> floored painting position (0, 0)
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2), 
        but the actual painting offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of parent flooring.
        
        Non-compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> GraphicsContext is translated to (0, 0).
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2)
        but the GraphicsContext's offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of the parent's translate.   

        In both cases, without the subpixel adjustment, we'd paint the current layer at (10.0, 10.0)
        after flooring, while its painting position is actually (10.5, 10.5).
        Subpixels do accumulate through nested layers.

        Have the scrolling tree track the viewport size, not the viewport rect
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130141

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        The scrolling tree only needs to know the size of the viewport, not its
        origin, since the origin is deduced from the updated scroll position.
        
        Tests dump a size, not a rect with a 0,0 origin now.

        FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() returned an IntSize,
        but to allow subpixel scroll offsets, we need it to return a LayoutSize.

        Reduce memory use for static property maps
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129986

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Static property tables are currently duplicated on first use from read-only memory into dirty memory
        in every process, and since the entries are large (48 bytes) and the tables can be unusually sparse
        (we use a custom hash table without a rehash) a lot of memory may be wasted.

        [CSS Shapes] Remove deprecated shapes

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Remove tests for deprecated shape syntax.

        There are also a few shape-inside tests that have been removed because
        they were very difficult to make work without the rectangle shape, and
        the future of the current shape-inside implementation is questionable
        at best.

        Subpixel rendering: Simple compositing container layer (isSimpleContainerCompositingLayer) paints to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129861

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that both the simple and non-simple cases paint to the same position.
        Simple compositing container layer codepath needs to take the fractional device pixel offset
        into account when painting. Without the fractional value, the final paint rounding could push the
        paint offset to a different position.
        retina example:
        compositing top-left: 0px 0px.
        fractional offset: 0.3px 0.3px
        painting coords without offseting: 0px 0px
                           with offseting: 0.5px 0.5px

            The root cause is CompositeEditCommand::moveParagraphWithClones() passing
            two positions |start| and |end| which do not follow the document order,
            i.e. in some situations |start| is located after |end| because of
            the difference in affinity.

            This patch fixes this crash by normalizing |end| to |start| in such situations.
            It also adds an ASSERT that checks the relationship between |start| and |end|.

        outlineBoundsForRepaint() is expected to return the outline repaint rect. Using enclosingIntRect()

        Since enclosingIntRect() can return bigger rect than repaint rect, the old/new bounds' dimensions could end up

        This test renders large text with a double underline, but then barely clips off the bottom underline
        using overflow: hidden. It makes sure that this is exactly the same as a single underline. If the
        space between the two underlines does not scale with font size, it will appear as though there is a
        single thick underline (because they will be drawn on top of each other) and will thus fail this test.

        Ensure keySplines is valid in SMIL animations
        <http://webkit.org/b/129547>
        <rdar://problem/15676128>

        http://crbug.com/276111

            This patch fixes a crash in SMIL animations when keySplines are not
            specified. The SMIL spec is clear on this:
            http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncCalcMode
            "If there are any errors in the keyTimes specification (bad values,
            too many or too few values), the animation will have no effect."

            This patch simply checks that keyTimes is not empty. Previously,
            splinesCount was set to be m_keySplines.size() + 1 in
            SVGAnimationElement.cpp; this patch changes splinesCount to be equal
            to m_keySplines.size() to make the logic easier to follow and to
            match other checks in SVGAnimationElement::startedActiveInterval.

        Filters should test for area instead of single dimension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123716

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        A filtered SVG element with a sigle dimension bigger than 5000
        (counting the margin/border) will fail to render. So an element
        with 4000x4000 will render fine, while another with 5000x10
        won't. This patch instead tests against the total element area,
        which fixes such cases.

        The current patch fixes the rendering issue and at same time,
        fixes some layer violations where FilterEffectRenderer and
        RenderSVGResourceFilter were directly accessing the kMax value
        in FilterEffect. Since before a somewhat bigger filter would
        be aborted, it required to change the maximum kernel size
        for blur filter (some filters are slower to run than others for
        bigger SVGs).

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This test changes the page scale factor to a very large value, simulating
        the user zooming in with a trackpad. It then positions the viewport
        to a place where the underline should not be drawn. It then compares this
        to a completely white page.

        This explanation cannot be in the test itself because the test sets the
        scale factor too high for the tester to be able to read text.

        [WebRTC] Validating RTCConfiguration according to the spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129182

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Spec states that:
            - iceServers should not be an empty list
            - the entry in the configuration dictionary is "urls", instead of "url"
            - urls can be either a list or a string
        Fixing all that in RTCConfiguration validation when creating a RTCPeerConnection

        I have elided about 1100 lines of rename Changelog spew;
        no filenames have been altered in this reorganization.

        Remove mentions of obsolete tests from TestExpectations. Remove skips
        for inspector-obsolete/ from port-specific expectations, and just
        put it in the generic expectations file.

        Remove inspector-protocol/heap-profiler tests, as they are obsolete.

        Remove many tests that were specific to the old inspector user interface.
        These cannot be ported either because they were specific to the UI, or
        they test features that no longer exist in the Web Inspector.

        [Win] fast/table/col-and-colgroup-offsets.html - offsetHeight differs from Mac results
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129179

        The test col-and-colgroup-offsets.html is failing on the Apple Win Debug (Tests) bot due
        to platform-specific numeric differences in the computed offsetHeight of the table cells.
        For now, I am landing Windows-specific expected results as the behavior tested by the test
        is correct despite the numerical differences. I'll further investigate the Window-specific
        difference in <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129179>.

        The existing tests for mouseenter/mouseleave had very poor readability which made them

        Add tests for regions in multi-column elements and a test that verifies
        regions are correctly clipped by their containers when both have hidden
        overflow.
        For the non horizontal-tb writing modes tests there's no overflow after the
        last region because it's not rendered correctly yet in a new column.
