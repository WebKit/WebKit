        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138366

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        This patch ensures that we clean up RenderNamedFlowFragment::m_renderObjectRegionStyle when embedded flow content is getting destroyed.

        In m_renderObjectRegionStyle hash map, we store style information about the named flow's descendant children.
        When a child is being detached from the tree, it removes itself from this hashmap.
        We do it by traversing up on the ancestor chain and call removeFlowChildInfo() on the parent flow.
        However in case of embedded flows (for example multicolumn content inside a region), we need to check whether the parent flow
        is inside a flow too and continue the cleanup accordingly.

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Updated the check for out of stack at eval entry test from using a fixed number of frame to
        back track to now adjust the amount of back tracking up the stack based on where we can run a
        simple eval().  At that point in the stack we try to cause an out of stack exception.

        Also added a second pass of the test that takes the originally failing eval and tiers that
        eval expression up to the DFG when used with the agreessive options of run-jsc-stress-tests.
        This was done to reduce the amount of time the test takes to run in debug builds.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133462

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        RenderFlowThread::m_lineToRegionMap stores pointers to the root inlineboxes in the block flow.
        Normally root inlineboxes remove themselves from this map in their dtors. However when collapsing an anonymous block,
        we detach the inline tree first and destroy them after. The detached root boxes can't access
        the flowthread containing block and we end up with dangling pointers in this map.
        Call removeFlowChildInfo() before detaching the subtree to ensure proper pointer removal.

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Results changed on some tests that expected the old "remove all content if a cycle is detected"
        behavior from the <use> element. The new behavior is to inhibit cycles, but render everything
        else, which is much easier to implement correctly and also makes logical sense. Changed all
        those tests to be reference tests, which makes sense since they are focusing on what gets
        rendered in these complex cases, and the expected results are a lot easier to understand in
        SVG form than they were in txt/png form. This also means we can remove a lot of platform-specific
        results since reference tests aren't sensitive to small platform differences in rendering.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This test relies on a zero-delay timer being a lot faster than fetching from network.
        Force a layout before starting the test, because otherwise, the layout can significantly
        delay the timer (I've seen 50-60 milliseconds being a common delay in debug builds).

        Also, changed the resource URL to avoid Apache error log spew.

        Do not destroy RenderQuote's text fragment child when quotation mark string is changing.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Similar approach as https://codereview.chromium.org/679593004/

        This patch ensures that laying out a RenderQuote does not force a sibling RenderQuote's
        child renderer(RenderText) to be destroyed.
        BreakingContext holds a pointer to the next renderer on the line (BreakingContext::m_nextObject).
        While laying out the line, initiated by BreakingContext, placing the current renderer could end up destroying the "next" renderer.
        This happens when the pseudo after quotation mark(RenderQuote) becomes floated, the sibling <q>'s pseudo
        before text needs to be changed (from " to ') so that we don't end up with 2 sets of the same opening
        strings.
        The fix is to reuse the RenderTextFragment object instead of destroy/recreate it.

        Add layout test to make sure that the font-family is still exposed to the
        Web as a CSSValueList of CSSPrimitiveValues whose primitiveType is
        CSS_STRING. This is useful because we now use a slightly different

        Rebaseline the test. This is a progression. Setting the 'font' property
        to a system font ID is supposed to reset the line-height property to
        'normal'. It previously did not because system font IDs were not
        expanded at parsing time. The new behavior is consistent with Chrome and
        Firefox as well.

        Rewrite the fast/css/css2-system-fonts.html test to be more useful on all platforms

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Make the fast/css/css2-system-fonts.html explicit about the font styles
        expected on each platform instead of just Mac.

        It also converts the test to be text only as the style information is

        [SVG -> OTF Converter] Flip the switch on
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140592

        Updating test expected results.

        svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/fonts-glyph-04-t.svg tests something which isn't spec'ed
        and is impossible to perform with the converter, so I have deleted that
        test.

        svg/custom/skip-underline-missing-glyph-expected.html was testing
        incorrect behavior, so I have updated the test.

        The getStartPositionOfChar() calls in svg/text/kerning.svg and
        svg/text/multichar-glyph.svg are currently impossible to be implemented
        correctly with the converter, so I have updated the expected results to
        test for the updated results of those calls.

        Some messages lost line numbers now. Some of these were definitely wrong, others
        were roughly right. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to figure out whether
        ScriptController actually executes a script after passing control to it. So the cases
        where it refuses to execute the script and logs a message are handled like those
        where it does.

        I think that it shouldn't be a big obstacle in practice, it is easy enough to find
        a script in a page when Web Inspector tells you that scripts were not allowed.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Tracks shrink sometimes with indefinite remaining space
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139059

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The third step of the grid track sizing algorithm (method
        ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks in the old specs version of the
        algorithm) tries to grow all grid tracks until the remaining space
        is exhausted. Should the remaining space is undefined we should fill
        the tracks up to their limits. This is specified in pseudocode like
        this:

            For each Grid track t in GridTracks
                t.UsedBreadth = t.MaxBreadth

        That's correct for most of the cases, but it becomes
        wrong whenever t.UsedBreadth > t.MaxBreadth something that is not
        incorrect. What we actually want to do is to grow the track to its
        maximum if and only if the used breadth is smaller than the maximum.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When the hit point gets translated beyond the min/max value of LayoutRect (infiniteRect()),
        we fail to find the corresponding layer.
        When there's no clipping on a layer, we use min/max values to represent infiniteness.
        However it does not work well across types. With IntPoint(hittest) we can address a point that's outside
        of LayoutRect's boundary(clipping).
        This patch addresses the immediate issue of not being able to hittest transformed layers properly.

        The test shows the text contents of the <li> element with the counter inside <ol> using three childAtIndex().stringValue methods.
        In the case of ATK childAtIndex(0) returns a non-empty object, but it is not the ATK_OBJECT,

        Calling clearSelection on a detached RenderObject leads to segfault.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140275

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We collect selection rects and compute selection gaps in order to
        paint/clear selection. With certain content, we need to be able
        to walk the tree up to a particular container to compute the selection rect.
        However this container might not be available when the selection is part of a detached tree.
        This is a null-check fix to ensure we don't crash in such cases, but in the long run
        selection gaps and rect should be cached between two layouts so that we don't need to
        keep collecting/recomputing them. Tracked here: webkit.org/b/140321

        This is a subpixel problem. Flexbox uses SimpleLineLayout for the entire
        box and therefore does all its math in floating point, while the
        -expected uses the regular renderer hierarchy and therefore fixed-point
        math. This patch updates the test to use Ahem so that the character
        widths divide the same way in both cases.

        Use only FloatQuad in RenderGeometryMap::mapToContainer.

        Due to the difference in the internal representation of FloatRect and FloatQuad,
        with certain float values, converting FloatRect to FloatQuad and back
        to FloatRect could produce a slightly different rect.

        These tests are very flaky since they expect to be run in order. Furthermore, they were testing a WebKit Mac SPI

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        1. XHR loads are aborted when a page load starts, not when it's committed (which
        is a known bug in WebKit). This gave the failure timer an opportunity to fire between
        these events. Fixed by extending the delay.

        2. Starting the test while parsing had a potential for a race with loading - we
        could run it before all data was loaded. While this probably didn't happen in
        practice here, it's better to run navigation tests under 100% reproducible conditions,
        like during onload.

        fast/canvas/webgl/angle-instanced-arrays.html is very flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139958

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        WebGL test harness added js-test-post.js in a flaky manner, and to make things worse,
        this test also had its own include of js-test-post.js.

        Looking at the tests, I noticed that the way test harnesses were used was a big mess,
        so I went over the whole directory, making these changes:
        1. Use js-test.js instead of js-test-pre.js, because it's simpler and better macthes
        the Khronos test model.
        2. Removed js-test-post.js everywhere (some tests included it in particularly crazy ways).
        3. Removed successfullyParsed = true, as js-test.js doesn't need that.
        4. Updated DOCTYPE, while editing these tests anyway.
        5. Tests now have correct order of lines in the output (no longer saying TEST COMPLETE
        before PASS), so updated results.
        6. In js-test tests, we shouldn't use waitUntilDone/notifyDone explicitly, so
        updated these with jsTestIsAsync.
        7. Updated async tests that used initNonKhronosFramework(false) plus some way to
        become async to simply say initNonKhronosFramework(true).
        8. Removed isSuccessfullyParsed() calls that several tests were using as an ugly
        workaround for issues caused by misusing the harness. This is never expected to be
        called directly.

        * fast/canvas/webgl/angle-instanced-arrays-out-of-bounds.html:
        Removed an unneeded js-test-style.css include.

        * fast/canvas/webgl/framebuffer-bindings-unaffected-on-resize.html:
        Swapped lines to not have glErrorShouldBe after finishTest.

        * fast/canvas/webgl/resources/webgl-test.js:
        (initNonKhronosFramework): webgl-test.js relies on js-test anyway, so there is
        no need to duplicate the work.
        (nonKhronosFrameworkNotifyDone): Use the proper js-test mechanism.
        (finishTest): Ditto.
        (finishTest.epilogue.document.createElement.epilogue.onload): Deleted.

        * resources/js-test.js:
        (expectTrue): Added this function that we only has in js-test-pre.js.
        (): Perform work after test's load event handler, not immediately on DOMContentLoaded.
        This has two benefits:
        1. Tests that enable jsTestIsAsync in onload do work. This is expected, because
        tests that call waitUntilDone from onload also do work.
        2. Non-async tests that perform work in onload have the correct order of lines in output.

        shouldBecomeEqual() behaves as shouldBe() if the testing expression returns the expected value
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133939

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        First call of eval(expression) inside shouldBecomeEqual was always
        made synchronously. If the testing expression returns the same value
        as expected one then shouldBecomeEqual() will immediately report PASS,
        for example,

        shouldBecomeEqual(internals.hasSpellingMarker("wellcome"), false);

        in consequence, assuming asynchronous path of spellchecking, spelling markers
        may appear after a while.

        The bug was caused by checking a condition at the beginning of shouldBecomeEqual(),
        before calling a timer. As a result, queued asynchronous events doesn't effect
        this checking.

        These scripts were not "slow" at all - 100 microseconds is nothing. Furthermore,
        slow-loading-sheet-in-error.php wasn't even used, because of a typo in the test.
        And worst of all, WebCore has its own ideas about when to load stylesheets - notably,
        default stylesheet loading blocks script execution, so we cannot do anything before
        the stylesheet loads.

        Continuously repainting large parts of Huffington Post.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139468

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch eliminates redundant repaint requests for inlines when neither the parent
        block flow nor any of the inline children are dirty.
        Previously,
        1. simple line layout always recalculated inline content positions regardless of whether
        the content needed relayout at all; as a result, it always triggered full repaint.
        2. inline tree layout ignored the needslayout flag on the last line and treated it dirty
        (unless it broke cleanly (<div>foo<br></div>)).
        This was an ancient workaround for an editing/insert use case, but it seems not to be the case anymore.

        This patch ensures that the out of flow positioned render boxes (RenderReplaced) do not
        get repositioned when their inline box wrappers move.
        Ideally, out of flow positioned renderers do not have inline wrappers by the time we start
        placing inline boxes, but in certain case (optimized code path for descendantsHaveSameLineHeightAndBaseline()),
        they are still part of the inline box tree.
        This patch prevents those renderer boxes from getting positioned as part of the inline box placement.
        They will get removed later at RenderBlockFlow::computeBlockDirectionPositionsForLine().

        rdar://problem/19050653

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        In certain cases, when block flow needs to compute the preferred width of a particular text
        renderer, we use the non-simple line layout text measuring.
        However, the same text renderer might end up at simple line layout later.
        Complex line layout measures text including the trailing space and it subtracts
        (the constant value of) space width afterwards, while simple line layout measures
        runs without the extra space.
        In such cases, this may result different word widths and produce unexpected line breaking. (preferred width != final width)
        In long term, any text renderer qualified for simple line layout should go through the simple
        text measuring code path. (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138973)
        For now, just copy complex line layout behaviour. This also matches the previous simple line layout line breaking implementation.

        http tests should not use shared temporary files, part 2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138894

        Rubber-stamped by Tim Horton.

        Made more scripts that access local files use per-test files. Some tests could use

        Add initial layout testing coverage for timer throttling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138809

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Add initial layout test coverage for timer throttling. It currently
        covers the following cases:
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Repeating timer doing DOM mutations
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Nested timer doing DOM mutations

        More layout tests are coming. In particular, we should add coverage for
        changing the style of an Element outside the viewport. We should also
        Test that the timer gets unthrottled if necessary on scrolling / layout.

        Add a test case to make sure we don't crash when parsing an <input>
        Element that has a |border| attribute as first attribute. This is what
        was happening with the first version of this patch that landed in
        r175852. When attributeChanged() was called for the |border| attribute
        HTMLInputElement::isPresentationAttribute() would get called before
        m_inputType is initialized, and "name == borderAttr && isImageButton()"
        would crash because isImageButton() dereferences m_inputType.

        The JIT should cache property lookup misses.
        <https://webkit.org/b/135578>

        Add a JSRegress test for caching of property lookup misses.
        There are three subtests:

            1. Pure speed test.
            2. Test for when a property previously cached as missing suddenly
               appears on the object.
            3. Same as (2), but it appears on the prototype.

        The test runs ~5.5x faster with the optimization.

        Give pseudo elements the correct specificity

        * fast/css/pseudo-element-specificity.html: Added.
        Given that all selector affecting the pseudo element were offset by one,
        it is impossible to use a pseudo element directly to affect the order, making the bug
        hard to test.

        What I did here for testing is use the stauration at 255 of any specificity field.
        With 255 class + 1 pseudo element, the old code would saturate at (0, 255, 0), while
        the fixed code would correctly give (0, 255, 1). By comparing that to a non-saturated
        selector, I can show the fix is correct.

        ASSERTION NOT REACHED because RenderStyle::setWordSpacing() does not handle a Length value of type 'Calculated'.

        Ensure the render style's wordSpacing can be set correctly when the type of
        the new value is 'Calculated'. The 'Calculated' Length value can result from
        blending two Length values of different types. And these two Length values
        are defined in two consecutive css animation key frames.

        CSS4 Selectors: Add the pseudo class :any-link
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138128

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Story time: I implement only half of the patch and run
        fast/selectors/webkit-any-link.html to make sure it fails...
        and the test happily PASS.

        I look into it and sure enough, a last minute change in
        html-link-type-tests.js made it test nothing but :link.

        I update html-link-type-tests.js to actually test the desired selector,
        run the test again: PASS.

        I debug a bit and I find why my code is not tested: html-link-type-tests.js
        uses Element.matches() and that does not use the CSS JIT.

        Fair enough, I add a querySelectorAll("#target' + selector + '") to run
        through the JIT: PASS.

        Since that selector is simple-#id + simple selector, we go through a fast
        path for ids and skip the JIT. Arrrrg!

        Finally, I added querySelectorAll(".target' + selector + '"), which covers
        the CSS JIT.

        The nice thing is: all those cases are tested now :)

        Update Yosemite results for platform/mac/editing/spelling/delete-autocorrected-word-2.html.

        Looks like this got confused during Yosemite tests landing.

        This test is currently marked as failing on WK2, but it passed for me, so maybe we
        can mark it as passing there too. Tracked as bug 105616.

        Prior to Yosemite results landing, this test was marked as failing on WK2, and its
        results matched WK1. It got changed several times during the merge, so it ended
        up being marked as failing on WK1, but with WK1 results landed.

        Let's land WK2 results and keep testing on WK2. Also, Mavericks results were no different
        from Yosemite.

        Clamp wordSpacing percentage value.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129350.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Make sure that setting the CSS style wordSpacing property to very huge percentage
        value and blending this value with other values for animating key frames does
        not assert or crash. The expectation is to have this huge value to be clamped to
        the pre-defined min/max values for the CSS length type. So when blending the clamped
        value with other wordSpacing values, the result can't be NaN. This should be very
        similar to the case when it is set to a huge <length> value.

        SVG loaded through html <img> can't request to load any external resources.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137762.

        Ensure that SVG images, which are loaded through the <img> tag or through the
        CSS background image, cannot load any external sub-resource except for data-
        URL resources (though this doesn't work at the time of writing, see bug #137941).
        Also ensure the same rule is enforced on cached resources.

        Add test for innerHTML mutations that yield identical DOM.

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        I made this test while working on an optimization, and it seems useful
        to have in the tree since it adds additional coverage. The optimization
        may come later.

        The test works by creating little DOM subtrees like so:

            <foo><bar>some text</bar></foo>

        It then overwrites that subtree with an identical one by mutating the
        containing element's innerHTML property. It then verifies that the DOM
        structure is correct and that Node wrappers retain any custom properties
        set on them.

        RenderMathMLUnderOver adds spacing to the child operator indefinitely when resizing the window.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137330

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Change the layout with resize test of the MathML underover object from being render tree test
        to be reference test. The render test was failing on WK2 because it was doing window resizing 
        and view zooming.  The new test rely solely on forcing the layout synchronously by resizing the
        math container <div> element.

        This is an interesting new case with the new definition. Since the initial
        element must also match the selector, it is now possible to fail even
        if the combination An+B can match anything.

        When the alignment is center, which is the common case for math, changing the size of
        an object affects the position of this object also.  We need to confirm that zooming or
        resizing the window should not affect the rectangle of the over/under math object operator.

        * platform/mac/mathml/opentype/opentype-stretchy-horizontal-expected.txt:
        This test was wrong because of the spacing issue. The page has two <mover> math objects at the beginning.
        Each of them has an <mspace> child. The width of the first <mspace> is 1em while the width of the second
        <mspace> is 2em. The font size is 10pt. So it is expected to have the first one 10 pixels and the second 
        to be 20 pixels. In the test, the width of the first is 22 and the width of the second is 32.
        I do expect this test to fail on other platforms since they have the same mistake which is now fixed. I am
        going to submit the mac expected version only and when it fails I am going to collect the result and submit
        another patch for the other platforms expected files.

        There are 3 big kind of changes to the tests:
        1) The new implementation intentionally breaks :not() of :visited and :link.
           Some test for the basic :not(:link) and :not(:visited) are consequently failing.
        2) Some tests were ensuring that :not() only support simple selectors, those are
           becoming irrelevant.
        3) New test for the feature.
