        Change the layout test from using a data: URL to using a file:///
        URL for the iframe.  If DRT's frame loader has
        AllowLocalLoadsForLocalOnly, then it's not possible to load an image
        from disk into the iframe.  Since this test is about D&D, not
        local load checks, switch to a local file that doesn't have this
        problem.

        This should fix the test on win DRT as well.

        Make sure that the initial shouldPaint check that looks at enclosingLayers properly skips over
        layers that don't paint themselves.  This is done by adding a new enclosingSelfPaintingLayer method
        so that RenderObjects can walk up the enclosing layer chain and skip any layers that don't paint
        themselves.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23740, painting order wrong for normal flow elements with overflow: hidden
        
        This patch reworks the painting of overflow.  There is now the concept of a "self-painting layer."  All
        layers are considered to be self-painting except for overflow layers that are normal flow (and that don't have
        reflections or masks).
        
        If an overflow layer is not self-painting, then it ends up painted by its parent just like any other normal flow object.
        The only difference is that the clip has to be pushed and popped when painting the object's children.
        
        The lightweight clipping scheme used for controls has been extended to cover overflow now in this simplified case.  With
        the code consolidated into reusable push/pop functions, all of the renderers that use overflow have been patched to
        use the new functions.
        
        Hit testing has also been patched to check the overflow clip rect first before recurring into children.
        
        Scrollbar paint has been moved into RenderBlock for now, since none of the table objects support scrollbars
        yet, and scrollbar hit testing was already there anyway.  Now the two code paths are more symmetrical.
        
        Masks are now treated like normal flow layers (just like reflections).
        
        A couple of test cases have been added to fast/overflow to test the stacking order.

        Fix a bug where reflections didn't work properly if opacity was < 1.  Make sure that replaced elements
        also consider reflections to be part of their visual overflow.  This had already been done for blocks
        and lines, but it wasn't being done yet for replaced elements.

        Also make sure that when the object being reflected has opacity < 1 that we don't end up popping the outer
        transparency layer early.  Since the reflected object paints twice, we don't want to end the transparency
        layer it pushed until we're done painting the real object (rather than the reflection).

        subframes, and data: is a non-hierachical scheme, so resolving such URLs fails, resulting
        in a KURL object that is not valid. WebKit used to ignore this, and tried to create a URL
        from this string again, now with a single argument KURL constructor, which resulted in a

        Expected results are taken from Firefox 3, and WebKit doesn't match in how fragments are

        The first set of files below tests that URLs are encoded properly
        based on the charset of the stylesheet.  Normally this behavior may
        only be tested by looking at web server logs with manual tests, but
        webarchives represent this information in such a way that they may
        be tested by DumpRenderTree.  Note that these tests depend on Bug
        11850 being fixed, so it's not possible to separate them.

        The second set of files below tests that all types of resources

        Revises charset alias map for TextCodecICU.
        - Uses windows-949 and windows-874 instead of windows-949-2000 and windows-874-2000
        - Replaces 'windows874' in a couple of place with 'windows-874' (for the canonical name)
        - Maps 'dos-874' to 'windows-874'. Currently, it's aliases to 'cp874', which is in turn
          mapped to 'TIS-620'. 'TIS-620' is manually aliased to 'windows-874'. We'd better directly
          alias 'dos-874' to 'windows-874'.
        - Replaces 'EUC-CN' with 'GBK' when it's used as the canonical name.
          Similar to the above case, we're getting rid of indirection that eventually leads to 'GBK' by
          directly going to 'GBK'.
        - Puts Mac encodings in a separate test 'char-decoding-mac.html'. Rename 'char-decoding-mac.html'
          in platform/mac to 'xnextstep-decoding.html' to avoid the name collision in the result files.
        - Adds a JS file for common functions used by char-decoding-*.html tests.

        Fixed <video> layout tests so that DRT is notified they are done only when the video frames
        are effectively rendered in the page. This requires using a timeout since there is no <video>
        event that fires when the first frame has been drawn (the closest even fires when the element
        is ready to render and will eventually draw at some unknown point in the future).
        Thanks to this change, these tests now pass in --pixel mode as well.

        Test for Bug 22161: Assertion failure in RenderThemeWin::systemColor
        when loading microsoftpdc.com

        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22161>

        Note that this test would only fail if DumpRenderTree used
        RenderThemeWin, which it doesn't. I did test that locally, though.

        Bug 21817: Manual profiler tests should be made into layout tests

        - Here are the changes to the tests.  The most significant part is the
        change to profiler-test-JS-resources.js where endTest will now notify
        the layout test controller if it was waiting and call the print function
        to iterate over all of the profiles and log their structure.
        - Most of these tests changed to include the layoutTestController, use
        endTest() or call the print function directly if there was some reason
        that they could not use endTest().

        * fast/profiler/resources/profiler-test-JS-resources.js:
        (endTest): Stop any waits and print the profile information.
        (printHeavyProfilesDataWithoutTime): Print all profile information in
