        The way that we "skip" tests is by having a custom command at the top using //@ notation,
        and then use "//@ skip". But the machinery to do that also allows us to do things like
        run tests in a no-concurrent-JIT mode - so I've also implemented that in this patch.

        [CSS Regions] Layout Test for selecting text ignoring region content
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122353

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Add new reftests for selecting text in texts wrapping a region, where
        the region content is ignored. It compares the behavior (highlighted
        text and selected content) in regions and absolute positions.

        Absolute positioned elements do not fill the gaps on the right during
        the selection, unlike regular elements. This is the reason why some
        regular elements are floated in order to avoid such problems in the
        reftests.

        [CSS Regions] Activate all regions to have layers, as CSS Regions create a new stacking context
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121828

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        For the ref tests, the divs in the expected results coresponding to the regions now have a CSS style causing
        them to also create Stacking Contexts.

        Most of the tests in fast/regions/layers/ have been deleted because they aren't relevant anymore.

        The change in most of the *-expected.txt files is that the " hasLayer" part has been removed (since all regions
        now have layers).
        
        Platform (efl, efl-wk2, gtk, mac-lion, mac-wk2, qt, qt-wk2) specific expectated results need to be generated again.

        Layout Test media/click-volume-bar-not-pausing.html is flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122126

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Speculative partial fix.

        I'm not sure if it's possible to make this test completely controlled without
        DOMFrameContentLoaded support - we need to do work when the <video> element is
        already present, but playback hasn't started yet. As media documents use autoplay,
        there is a race between load and playing events.

        * media/click-volume-bar-not-pausing-expected.txt:
        * media/click-volume-bar-not-pausing.html:
          - Add video URL after initial content fully loads to avoid races with that.
          - Added some state logging for clarity.
          - Only listen for "playing" event once. If playback already started, we have a
          playing event already queued, and would add another one with pause()/play().

        When deciding whether a line is considered empty, we need to check if the current
        object is fully responsible for the currently uncommitted width. It helps differentiating
        <span></span><span>abcd</span> from <span>a</span><span>bcd</span>, where in the first
        case when we hit the second <span> the line is still considered empty, as opposed to the

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        This test was not querying the vertex attribute locations
        before binding data to them. When we enabled symbol mangling
        we started seeing attributes appear in a different order
        than the order defined in the shader source. Update this test
        to ask getAttribLocation first.

        Note that there are two important issues.

        Firstly, this is updating our local copy of the Khronos test.
        I've opened pull request #377 to get it addressed in the source.
        https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/pull/377

        Secondly, this indicates that we might have a lot of problems
        with existing content that does not expect the order of
        attributes to change.

        Use shouldBecomeEqual in asynchronous spellchecking tests.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121483

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Every asynchronous spellchecking layout test waits for spelling or grammar
        markers using setTimeout. It duplicates the code, moreover the implementation
        differs in every test.

        Use shouldBecomeEqual helper (introduced in r143860) to test spellchecking
        asynchronously.

        At the beginning, those tests check whether spelling marker appears
        synchronously. Then, spell checking is disabled to check whether
        the markers have disappeared properly.
        There is no need to check spelling asynchronously in the second part
        of the tests. Use synchronous spellchecking path instead.

        [CSS Shapes] Use the float height to determine position in shape-inside
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102846

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Float positioning inside shape-inside has been working only for simple cases when the float boundaries didn't overlap with the shape.
        This patch fixes the behavior for left floats and shapes with inline content. I want to add this work step by step, therefore the next
        step would be to add support for block content with inline content (e.g. paragraphs) then cover cases with right floats.

        Selection follows DOM tree, so the highlighted text in this test case is
        the opposite to what the user is actually selecting. This was not
        working properly from r139197 to r155058, so adding a Layout Test to
        prevent future breaks. It is a reftest comparing regions and absolute
        positions behavior.

        could still be in. Also, removed last week's experimental change to make 10x more
        nodes to see how that affects the number of leaks (it didn't).

        [CSS Shapes] Winding rule polygon issues
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120236

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Verify that self-intersecting rectilinear shape-inside polygons work
        correctly for the evenodd and nonzero fill rules.

        The shape for tests 001 and 002 contains a loop (the vertices are
        numbered in the figure):

        0----4----1----5
        |    |    |    |
        |    3----2    |
        7--------------6

        When the fillRule is nonzero the entire rectangle is filled because
        edges 7-0 and 3-4 wind in same direction. When fillRule is evenodd the
        1-2-3-4 rectangle is not filled, leaving a U shape.

        The shape for tests 003 and 004 is similar, but the adjacent vertical edges
        wind in opposite directions. As a result both nonzero and evenodd fills
        produce the same U shaped result.

        0----2---1,5---6
        |    |    |    |
        |    3----4    |

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Compositing layers keep track of ancestors' clipping by constructing the RenderLayerBacking::m_ancestorClippingLayer.
        It helps setting up the proper clipping context for the corresponding graphics layer.
        When a RenderObject's clipping style changes, it needs to propagate this change not only
        to the associated RenderLayer, but also to the descendants', if applicable.
        Before r132516, it was mainly covered by initiating full style recalcs, which ensured that
        style recalc on the descendant rendering tree took care of creating/destroying
        RenderLayerBacking::m_ancestorClippingLayer at every compositing layer node. Without the full
        recalc, the clipping of the compositing render layers and the corresponding render subtrees can get out of sync.
        This patch updates the clipping context on the descendant subtree, when the clipping behaviour
        changes on a render node.

        * inspector/geolocation-success.html:
        The test was expecting everything would be done in the page context
        when InspectorTest.evaluateInPage invoke the callback.

        This is not the case, geolocation APIs are asynchronous.
        The callbacks printLocation() and printError() may or may not be executed.

        To fix this, the execution of each step is changed to depends on the completion
        of the geolocation callback.

        Animate CSS Image filter() function
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119938

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Add tests to test animation between two filter() function values.
        Furthermore, extended animation-test-helpers.js to parse all kind of CSS
        image function where we support animations. CSS Image function can be
        deeply nested as well now:

            -wekit-filter(-webkit-cross-fade(url(a.png), url(b.png), 50%), sepia(0.5))

        Even the 50% can now be checked with a tolerance. If we should ever support
        animations on nested CSS Images, the new code in animation-test-helpers.js
        is prepared for it.

        Fixed a bunch of tests that passed by accident or needed an update to the new
        infrastructure.

        * animations/resources/animation-test-helpers.js:
        (parseCSSImage): For parsing of all kind of supported CSS Image functions.
            Currently supported: -webkit-cross-fade, -webkit-filter, url, none
            Still missing: linear and radial gradients (can not be animated yet).
            CSS Image functions are allowed to be nested as deep JS allows.
        (parseCrossFade): Add parsing of input CSS images.
        (parseFilterImage): Parse -webkit-filter image function as well as input images.
        (parseFilterFunctionList): Parse filter function list. We now parse the
            function name as well. Added rudimentary support for drop-shadow and url.
        (parseDeprecatedCustomFilterFunction): Special case old syntax of custom
            filter function. Shall be removed in the future.
        (compareCSSImages): Compares all kind (even deep nested) CSS images.
        (compareFilterFunctions): Now compare filter function names as well.
        (comparePropertyValue): Use new compareCSSImages function.

        This test needed to be modified to have the line numbers match on the output across
        wk and wk2. This test is inherently flaky because is relies on size of the available
        native stack. To account for the flakiness an additional call was made to force the 
        results to match. 
        This patch now records and outputs the line number where the errors were occurring. 
        This was causing the test results to no longer match because of the line numbers.
        By changing how to account for the flakiness, the results match again.

        [Soup] WebTiming information not shown in the inspector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118395

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        Fixed the webiming-ssl.php test that was incorrectly considering a
        FAIL as the expected result. It was probably just a legacy
        decision which came from the times where DRT was responsible of
        reporting WebTiming information.

        Also added a new test that fails due to wkb.ug/103927. It was not
        detected before because there were no timing information in the
        response.

        grammar-markers.html and grammar-markers-hidpi.html pass even if element does not have grammar marker
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119797

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        After tenth attempts of verifying the grammar marker, the tests call'notifyDone'
        even if grammar marker was not be found.

        Both grammar-marker.html and grammar-marker-hidpi.html call the text checker
        asynchronously. Therefore, we need to wait until either the grammar marker
        is found or number of attempts is reached.

        Dump more information whether the grammar marker was found to be sure that
        the tests do not pass when the element does not have the marker.

        Add coverage for three things:
        
        - Typed array accesses with corner-case values.
        
        - Typed array set() (i.e. copy) between arrays of different types.
        
        - Performance of typedArray.set() involving different types.
        
        This required some changes to our test harnesses, since they previously
        couldn't consistently do numerical array comparisons in a reliable way.

        Added a bunch of tests for different kinds of overlapping typedArray.set()'s.
        
        For sanity, also added the reduced test case from the bug. Interestingly, though, that test
        case already passed on trunk - probably by luck (we had incidentally changed the default
        copy direction from one that happened to not work to one that happened to be fine, but only
        for this test).

        There is no need to use cookies in this test, and it's actually slightly incorrect,

        From the srcset spec: "If there are any entries in candidates that have an associated pixel density that is less than a
        user-agent-defined value giving the nominal pixel density of the display, then remove them, unless that would remove all the
        entries, in which case remove only the entries whose associated pixel density is less than the greatest such pixel density."

        This test verifies that when all the candidates' qualifiers are smaller than the DPR, the highest one is returned.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Deleted the test. This test was added in r82054 but it has been crashing since r154242.

        Since our expected behavior is to crash at the moment, this test's description doesn't even match
        the expected behavior anymore. Furthermore, it intermittently times out due to DRT taking too long to
        allocate memory before it can crash.

        Restructure Qt test expectations

        Unreviewed meta gardening.

        Removed 5.0 name from WK1 and WK2 results and made it possible to set
        expectations by both Qt version and mayor architectures.

        Qt-5.0-WK2 will be moved later due to its size.

        editing/selection tests are very slow, and much of the time is spent
        doing spelling and grammar checking (which is not what these tests are
        testing). So call internals.setContinuousSpellCheckingEnabled(false)
        to turn that off.

        [CSS Shapes] New positioning model: scripted shape-margin tests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119491

        Update some of the shape-margin tests to work with the new positioning model. Floats
        that specify shape-outside are now positioned according to their margin box, not the
        bounding box of the shape-outside shape. The tests have been revised to reflect the
        change.

        Frame flattening: Change the logic on whether resize event needs to be dispatched.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119394

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/149287 changed the logic so that resize events are
        sent out from FrameView::setFrameRect() too. Checking whether frame flattening is
        enabled is sufficient enough to ensure that no extra resize events are dispatched.

        This test was modified by removing the error object from being evaluated. Prior to this patch 
        error objects did not have the stack property, so the stack information was not being 
        displayed. The stack trace includes a file path specific to the machine that is running 
        the test. The results would have differed from one computer to the next. There
        is not an easy way to capture the error object to treat it differently. By removing 
        the error object there is no need to add extra code to treat it differently.
        Also there are other tests inside inspector/console that test the  stack trace, 
        so the testing suite does not lose error testing by removing it.
        
        The .stack property was added to the error objects at creation time.

        fourthTier: fast/js should have a way of running tests long enough to wait for the concurrent JIT to tier up
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116878

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        This adds three things to js-test-pre and uses them in one representative test:

        silentTestPass: If you set this to true, then testPassed() won't print anything, and will instead just have
            isSuccessfullyParsed() print a message saying that some tests passed silently. This allows tests to call
            shouldBe() and friends in a loop whose running time is dependent on concurrent JIT behavior, and still
            be sure that the resulting test will be deterministic.
        
        noInline(): If testRunner is present, disable inlining of the relevant function.

        dfgIncrement({f:function, i:index, n:limit}): Returns index either if index < limit, or if the function is
            DFG compiled. Otherwise, if index >= limit and the function isn't DFG compiled, return 0. This means
            that the 'i++' in the fast/js/dfg-* warm-up loops can be replaced with:

            i = dfgIncrement({f:<function you're interested in>, i:i + 1, n:<some number smaller than the loop condition>)

            This has the effect of having the loop repeat the first 'n' iterations until the function is DFG
            compiled. See the modified test, where we do n:100 and the loop condition is i < 200. So the loop will
            repeat the first 100 iterations until the function is DFG compiled and will only do the last 100
            iterations once DFG compilation kicks in.

        Ensure that the content rect is initialized when the image is set on the graphics layer.

        RenderLayerBacking::updateGraphicsLayerGeometry() only updates the contents rect when
        the associated graphics layer has a content layer. Since the image gets committed 
        on the graphics layer after the update calls, the contents rect is left uninitialized.

        [CSS Shapes] Clear overflowing line's segments in pushShapeContentOverflowBelowTheContentBox
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118002

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        When the last line in the shape overlaps with the shape bottom boundaries we need to clear the computed segments. (We need to compute
        the segments anyway, since shape-outside's code uses the same code path to determine its segments and the line containing is not a
        requirement in that case.) Rather then doing the job in RenderBlock::LineBreaker::nextLineBreak I moved the functionality to its correct
        place to pushShapeContentOverflowBelowTheContentBox. Now all the overflow related functionality is located in one function. I fixed the
        corresponding layout test.

        Reviewed by Mark Hahnenberg and Geoffrey Garen.

        The fix now computes line and column numbers more accurately. As a result,
        some of the test results need to be re-baselined. Among other fixes, one
        major source of difference is that the old code was incorrectly computing
        0-based column numbers. This has now been fixed to be 1-based.
        Note: line numbers were always 1-based.

        Also added a new test: fast/js/line-column-numbers.html, which tests line
        and column numbers for source code in various configurations.

        [CSS Shapes] New positioning model: basic support for rectangle shape-outside
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118080

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Added new tests for the new model. These tests are also spec tests, so
        their canonical location is now in the CSS WG's repository. They have
        been imported to WebKit using the import-w3c-tests script, and that's
        why they live under the csswg directory.

        The new tests replace the shape-outside-floats-simple-rectangle.html
        test, which was anything but simple.

        Tests that have not been rewritten yet have been marked as skipped.
        Tests for the old positioning behavior that are not applicable to the
        new behavior have been deleted.

        [Mac] media/video-played-collapse.html is flakey on certain platforms.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117034

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        This test does not wait until a seek completes before issuing a play()
        command during its subtests. This can cause flakiness on some platforms
        where playback will begin from the pre-seek currentTime. Wait for the seek
        to complete before continuing the sub-tests.

        Additionally, a 2s watchdog timeout is present to catch stalled tests. This
        timeout is fine for short-duration sub-tests, but longer tests' durations
        approach this 2s timeout period. Make the timeout the test duration + 2s.

        While frames are being unloaded, the Frame object does not necessarily have valid

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117663

        Reviewed by Alexandru Chiculita.

        When you have a shape and the content overflows from the shape we need to push the overflow below the content box,
        not below the border box. We didn't consider the bottom borders of the content box, now I fixed it too and the overflow
        just starts after the content box. I added a new helper function called pushShapeContentOverflowBelowTheContentBox. Now
        both the shape in flow thread and the shape overflow use the same function. I added a new test and modified the existing
        tests to cover all the affected cases.

        Remove invalid checks from block-cursor-overtype-mode.html
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117587

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The test uses an array of ">" "<" symbols to perform comparisons
        between consecutive positions of the block cursor. Since those
        checks are done for each pair of consecutive characters the total
        amount of checks is lengthOfTheWord - 1. We were adding an extra
        symbol that was not used at all in the test.

        If an event is created using as target an HTMLMediaElement which is

        The GenericEventQueue instance is already owned by the HTMLMediaElement,
        and there already is an underlying mechanism to set the target of the

        In order to avoid creating this reference in the first place, we enqueue
        the event with a NULL target to defer the refcount increment until the
        timer for dispatching the event happens (which won't happen at all if

        [CSS Shapes][CSS Regions] Respect bottom positioned shapes and content adjustment inside shapes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117599

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        In r150478 I added support for multiple positioned shape-insides on regions, this patch covers the cases when a shape
        is positioned to the bottom of the region or the region contains a shape which forces the content to be adjusted inside
        the shape (e.g. we have a triangle shape and the first line needs to be started at the first position where it fits).
        I introduced a new helper function to update the current shape and the current line segments in the flow thread cases. With
        this new helper function all the logic which calculates the segments for shape-inside on regions is located in one function.

        SVG objects are misplaced when SVG root has CSS transform.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117252

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Update layer transforms for SVG if needed.

        SVG root, similarly to RenderBlock needs to call RenderLayer
        to get transforms updated after layout, in order to
        position the transformed objects properly.

        [JSC] Test262 15.5.4.9_3 test is failing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116789

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Add the 15.5.4.9_3 test from the test262 test suite to cover proper behavior of String.prototype.localeCompare
        when no arguments are passed to it. The test tests that str.localeCompare() and str.localeCompare(undefined) work
        the same way, i.e. using the string 'undefined' as the string with which str is compared (meaning that the first argument
        defaults to 'undefined' when not given).

        The test and the rationale behind it originates from bug #1245 in ECMAScript Bugzilla.
        https://bugs.ecmascript.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1245

        * fast/js/kde/StringObject-expected.txt: Update the baseline.

        REGRESSION (r143070): Overflow:scroll content does not get clipped properly when the parent box has CSS3 filter on.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116859

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Apply proper clipping for overflow:scroll, when parent dictates
        full repaint to ensure correct CSS3 filter effect.

        When a particular layer has 'pixel moving' CSS3 filter(drop shadow, blur), it sets clipToDirtyRect 
        to false to force no clipping on itself and on the child layers too.
        No clipping makes overflow:scroll behave like overflow:display, because
        overflow::scroll gets clipped at RenderLayer level (as opposed to overflow::hidden).
        This patch makes sure that both full repaint and clipping are ensured.

        Update XMLHttpRequest timeout tests to a newer version from W3C
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117023

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        The XMLHttpRequest Timeout tests have gone through a bit of restructuring and should
        be updated. This is being primarily done because of the intention of updating the
        testharness scripts which would break these tests if they were left not updated.

        These tests were updated from the W3C web-platform-tests GitHub repository.

        [WK2] Spelling tests gardening
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116718

        Unreviewed gardening.

        The most spelling tests are skipped for wk2 platforms and they have deprecated comments.
        Move the tests from global wk2/TestExpectations to the ports' TestExpectations as
        the core spellchecking implementation is delivered for wk2.
        This change will allow to run spelling tests easier and using [ Pass ] keyword
        in TestExpectations won't be needed.

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        It is only needed to register the listeners on the initial load as they
        are already present when restoring from page cache. Modified the test to
        use event.persisted property to know if we are handling the first load
        in order to register the listeners only once.

        [CSS Exclusions] property parsing tests should be revised
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116446

        Reviewed by Alexandru Chiculita.

        This is just a cleanup of the existing parsing tests. None of the tests have effectively
        changed. The cleaned-up version should be simpler, more regular, and shorter:
        - Moved all of parsing tests into a fast/exclusions/parsing subdirectory.
        - Remove the obsolete "wrap-" prefix from file names.
        - Eiminated excessive and needless stringification in many of the test functions.
        - Moved common code into parsing-test-utils.js and refactored redundant code.

        Regions should respect shape-inside properties which have specified top offset. Since the content which overflows from the

        Reviewed by Antonio Gomes.
        
        Frame flattening should be applied when the frame owner is frame or iframe. But when
        the frame owner is object element, frame flattening prevents it from having scrollbars.
        In this situation, we can't scroll the html document in object element.
        
        This patch adds two helper functions to verify flattening conditions.

        [CSS Exclusions] Simple shape-outside tests fail when subpixel layout is disabled

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        The overall goal of this change was to restore the (last) four excluded exclusions ref-tests

        substantially simplified, as was the supporting javascript code. The original
        shape-outside-floats-simple-rounded-rectangle test was replaced by three separate tests
        because the original was bigger then then the 800x600 limit and because it unncessarily
        combined three indepedent test cases.

        [CSS Regions][CSS Exclusions] Shape-inside on regions should respect region borders and paddings
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115456

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        I refactored the computation logic of shape-inside on regions by removing access to RenderFlowThread from ExclusionShapeInfo's logicalTopOffset
        function, this means all the logic is now existing in RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp. By modifying the logicalTopOffset it turned out that the borders
        and padding hadn't worked correctly, since borders and paddings were counted twice in the shape-inside's computation. This patch adds the necessary
        modifications to let it respect the borders and padding in the correct way. I created 2 new helper functions to prevent increasing the code size of
        the layoutRunsAndFloatsInRange function.

        [CSS Exclusions] shape-inside, shape-padding, polygon test failing when subpixel layout is disabled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115649

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Another correction of a padded shape test that failed when subpixel layout was disabled.
        This test puts a cross pattern made of five Ahem characters on three lines, within a padded
        diamond polygon. The left edges of each line depend on the intersection of the padded polygon's
        edges with the top of each line, which makes predicting the exact values unreliable. So we
        just verify that the left edges of each line are within a pixel of the ideal value. This
        change is very similar to the one made for bug 115490.

        Enable performance.now() as a minimal subset of Web Timing API. 
        It returns DOMHighResTimeStamp, a monotonically increasing value representing the

        JS libraries use this API to check against the requestAnimationFrame() timestamp.
        
        We can test the monotonical behaviour of this API only. Checking whether the value

        [GTK] Enable Web Audio layout tests on WK2, provide platform-specific expected output
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114513

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        Unskip the Web Audio layout tests for GTK WK2 and generate platform-specific baselines for the tests.
        The audio baselines are not audibly different from the generic baselines, but it can be expected that
        different backends won't produce the same binary output.

        The remaining failures are marked as such in the TestExpectations, each failure having the appropriate
        bug handle covering the issue. The tests are still skipped for GTK WK1 as DumpRenderTree is still missing
        infrastructure support for running these tests.
