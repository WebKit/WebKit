        When deciding whether a line is considered empty, we need to check if the current
        object is fully responsible for the currently uncommitted width. It helps differentiating
        <span></span><span>abcd</span> from <span>a</span><span>bcd</span>, where in the first
        case when we hit the second <span> the line is still considered empty, as opposed to the
