I got these tests from http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/traversal/node-iterator/ on February 3, 2008.
The only changes I made were:

    1) Add testRunner.dumpAsText() calls to each test.

    2) Changed the <![CDATA[]]> near the bottom of tests 001, 002, and 010 to
       <![CDATA[ ]]> to work around <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=514181>.
       Without the space, libxml2 omits the CharacterData node, causing the tests to fail.
