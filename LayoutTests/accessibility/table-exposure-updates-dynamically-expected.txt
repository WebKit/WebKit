This test ensures a table's "exposed" state (whether it is an accessibility data table, vs. just a layout table) updates in response to dynamic page changes.

Initial table state has aria-rowcount, so it should be a data table.
#table AXRole: AXTable
#cellOne AXRole: AXCell

Removing aria-rowcount. Based on this table's contents, it should now become a layout table.
#table AXRole: AXUnknown
#cellOne AXRole: AXGroup

Adding a lot of rows which should cause the table to become an accessibility data table.
#table AXRole: AXTable
#cellOne AXRole: AXCell
