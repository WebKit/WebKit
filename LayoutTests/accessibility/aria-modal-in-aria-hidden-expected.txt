This tests that when something is aria-modal inside an aria-hidden it is ignored.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS accessibilityController.accessibleElementById('bgContent').isIgnored is false
PASS !backgroundContent || backgroundContent.isIgnored is true
PASS accessibilityController.accessibleElementById('bgContent').isIgnored is false
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
Other page content with a dummy focusable element

Just an example.
