This is a very long, long, long, long, line that contains a link that expands multiple lines: Apple

Inc. is based in Cupertino California.



A singleline link: Apple Inc. is based in Cupertino California.

This test ensures that a link is activated with a simulated accessibility press regardless whether its bounding rect encompasses points outside the link. The multiline-link is an example of a bounding rect that contains points that are not part of the link, in particular the middle point of the rect.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
