This tests that when we access a text marker in a frame that is subsequently replaced by a different frame, we don't leave a hanging node in the cache that leads to a crash.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS string is 'hello'
PASS string is 'test text'
TEST PASSED: NO CRASH
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
