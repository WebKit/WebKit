Image link in the presence of inline continuations

This test checks that a block inside a link does not unduly disturb the render tree via inline continuations. In particular, it checks that adding <div role=presentation> between a link and its contained image does not alter the accessibility tree at all, other than with respect to size.



 PASS: accessibility trees were identical other than size.
