This tests ensures that root index and radicand work as expected for square root and generic root elements.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS sqrt.role is 'AXRole: AXGroup'
PASS sqrt.subrole is 'AXSubrole: AXMathSquareRoot'
PASS sqrt.mathRootRadicand.length is 2
PASS sqrt.mathRootRadicand[0].childAtIndex(0).stringValue is 'AXValue: x'
PASS sqrt.mathRootRadicand[1].childAtIndex(0).stringValue is 'AXValue: y'
PASS root.role is 'AXRole: AXGroup'
PASS root.subrole is 'AXSubrole: AXMathRoot'
PASS rootIndex.childAtIndex(0).stringValue is 'AXValue: 3'
PASS root.mathRootRadicand.length is 1
PASS root.mathRootRadicand[0].childAtIndex(0).stringValue is 'AXValue: 8'
