This tests ensures that we can retrieve the line thickness of a fraction object

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Verify the line thickness of 0 is reported correctly.
PASS fraction1.subrole is 'AXSubrole: AXMathFraction'
PASS fraction1.isAttributeSupported('AXMathLineThickness') is true
PASS fraction1.numberAttributeValue('AXMathLineThickness') is 0

Verify the line thickness of 4 is reported correctly.
PASS fraction2.subrole is 'AXSubrole: AXMathFraction'
PASS fraction2.isAttributeSupported('AXMathLineThickness') is true
PASS fraction2.numberAttributeValue('AXMathLineThickness') is 4

Verify missing line thickness returns default of 1 is reported correctly.
PASS fraction3.numberAttributeValue('AXMathLineThickness') is 1
PASS successfullyParsed is true
