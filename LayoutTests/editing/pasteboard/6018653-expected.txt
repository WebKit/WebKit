This tests for a bug where adding content to the end of a fragment that ends with an interchange newline and inserting it would create an extraneous newline at the *start* of pasted content. Below you should see two paragraphs of text followed by two empty paragraphs.

<div>Paragraph one</div><div>Paragraph two</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><div><br></div>
