This tests to see that tabs are put into tab spans when they are copied individually. The pasted tab should be inside of a tab span, not a style span. To run the test manually, paste and then inspect the editable region, and ensure that there is a tab span at the beginning of the editable div.

<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">	</span>xxx
