This tests a subset of pseudo-kotoeri behaviour:
All keydown events never result in keypress during composition
During composition all keydown events should have keyCode 229, this is necessary to match the behaviour of windows browsers, including WebKit/Win
To test this manually switch to the Kotoeri/Hiragana input method, and type 'toukyou'<enter><enter>.
You should see only a single keypress event, as the very last reported event.
