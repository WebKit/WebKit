This tests that the hangul IM behaviour in which enter both confirms a composition but still sends a keypress for the <enter>.
To test manually, switch to the 2-Set Korean IM and type at least two characters and press <enter>, if the behaviour is correct a single keypress event should be fired as the last event.
