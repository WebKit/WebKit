This tests auto-substitution with a multi-line text works.
To manually test, open Language & Text system preference and setup "helloleworld" to be replaced by
"helloworld" (copy paste it) and reload this page. You should see hello and world in two distinct lines.
| <div>
|   "hello"
| <div>
|   "world"
| <div>
|   <#selection-caret>
|   <br>
