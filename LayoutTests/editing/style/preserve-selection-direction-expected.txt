This test verifies that selection direction is preserved when applying styles.

Before foreColor 1:
| "Thi<#selection-anchor>s is <#selection-focus>some sample text"

After foreColor 1:
| "Thi"
| <font>
|   color="#008000"
|   "<#selection-anchor>s is <#selection-focus>"
| "some sample text"

Before foreColor 2:
| "Thi<#selection-focus>s is <#selection-anchor>some sample text"

After foreColor 2:
| "Thi"
| <font>
|   color="#008000"
|   "<#selection-focus>s is <#selection-anchor>"
| "some sample text"
