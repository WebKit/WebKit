This tests bolding a character immediately after a character that is already in bold.

Before bolding:
| "\n"
| <div>
|   class="editing"
|   id="test"
|   <b>
|     "a"
|   "<#selection-anchor>b<#selection-focus>"
| "\n"

After bolding:
| "\n"
| <div>
|   class="editing"
|   id="test"
|   <b>
|     "a"
|     "<#selection-anchor>b<#selection-focus>"
| "\n"
