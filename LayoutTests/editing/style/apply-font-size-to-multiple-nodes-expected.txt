Test that WebKit does not add multiple span or font elements when applying font-size to multiple nodes.

You should see exactly one font element with size="7" and exactly one span:
| <font>
|   size="7"
|   "\n<#selection-anchor>A man with 2\n"
|   <span>
|     style="font-family: Courier New, Courier"
|     "font faces"
|   <br>
|   "\nDeath comes in all\n"
|   "font sizes<#selection-focus>"
| "\n"
