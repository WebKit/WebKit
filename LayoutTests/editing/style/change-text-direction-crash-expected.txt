This test verifies that programmatically setting the text direction using editing commands doesn't crash.

MakeTextWritingDirectionLeftToRight:
| "foo"
| <div>
|   <span>
|     id="bar"
|     style="unicode-bidi: embed;"
|     "<#selection-anchor>a×ªbc"
| <div>
|   <#selection-focus>
|   "baz"

MakeTextWritingDirectionRightToLeft:
| "foo"
| <div>
|   <span>
|     id="bar"
|     style="unicode-bidi: embed; direction: rtl;"
|     "<#selection-anchor>a×ªbc"
| <div>
|   <#selection-focus>
|   "baz"

MakeTextWritingDirectionNatural:
| "foo"
| <div>
|   <span>
|     id="bar"
|     "<#selection-anchor>a×ªbc"
| <div>
|   <#selection-focus>
