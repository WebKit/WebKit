block-level text before floats
first float*second float*inline-level text after the floats
To test manually, drag from the middle of the 'first float' div to the right, until the space between the 'second float' and the inline-text. The selection should include both floats enterely with a portion of the inline-level box's background and not jump to the beginning.

SUCCESS: Selected test is 'float*second float*' as expected
