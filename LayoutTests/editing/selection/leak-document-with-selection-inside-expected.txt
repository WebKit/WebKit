This test asserts that document doesn't leak when a selection is created inside the document.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS internals.numberOfLiveDocuments() is originalNumberOfLiveDocuments
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
This test only runs on DumpRenderTree, as it requires existence of window.internals and cross-domain resource access check disabled.
