block-level text before floats
first float*second float*inline-level text after the floats
To test manually, drag from the middle of the 'first float' div to the right, into the inline-level text. The selection should include both floats with part of the inline-level box's background and text and not jump to the beginning.

SUCCESS: Selected test is 'float*second float*inlin' as expected
