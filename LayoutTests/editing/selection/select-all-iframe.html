<p><b>This test uses the eventSender to do a mouse click to focus the subframe.  It won't run interactively.</b>  To run it manually, click on the iframe, Select All, then hit delete.</p>
Selecting all the content in a contenteditable iframe should select the iframe itself (to help the user delete the iframe) only if the iframe is in an editable region.  This test loads ../resources/select-all-iframe-src.html into an iframe.  That file does a Select All + Delete.  Two things should happen:

<ul>
<li>The Select All operation should not select the iframe, only it's contents.  The results of the Select All will be apparent from the delegate messages that DumpRenderTree receives and dumps.</li>
<li>The contents of the editable iframe should be deleted.</li>
</ul>
