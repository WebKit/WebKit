block-level text before floats
first float*inline-level text after the floats
To test manually, drag from the middle of the 'first float' div to the right, into inline-level box. The selection should go to the end of the first float element with part of the inline-level box's background and text and not jump to the beginning.

SUCCESS: Selected test is 'float*in' as expected
