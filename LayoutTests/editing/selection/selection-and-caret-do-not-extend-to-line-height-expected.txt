This test verifies that caret and selection heights do not extend to match line height (or part of line height). To run the test manually, focus each of the editable elements and make sure that the caret roughly matches the font size in each editable element. Then select text in each of the elements with text and verify that the selection height also matches the font size.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
