Testcase for bug 103621: Caret is incorrectly painted for a contenteditable <div> containing a <br> in vertical writing mode. For the test to pass, carets in both the boxes should be exactly similar. To manually verify the issue, try clicking on the second box. A caret should be visible at the start of that container.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS withTextCaretRect.top is withoutTextCaretRect.top
PASS withTextCaretRect.width is withoutTextCaretRect.width
PASS withTextCaretRect.height is withoutTextCaretRect.height
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
