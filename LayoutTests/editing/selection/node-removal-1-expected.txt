EDITING DELEGATE: webViewDidChangeSelection:WebViewDidChangeSelectionNotification
This tests behavior when a node that serves as the start or end of a selection is removed from the document.
Ideally, we would just adjust the selection when an endpoint is removed, for now, we just blow away the selection.<br>
This test creates a selection that ends inside of a node that will be removed.  Then the node is removed.

Before removing node:
| <#selection-anchor>
| "\nhello "
| <span>
|   id="removeme"
|   style="color:red;"
|   "re<#selection-focus>moveme"
| " world!\n"

After removing node:
| <#selection-anchor>
| "\nhello "
| <#selection-focus>
| " world!\n"
