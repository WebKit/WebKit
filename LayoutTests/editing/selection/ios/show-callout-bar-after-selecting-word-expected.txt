This test verifies that the callout bar is shown after selecting a word in an editable element using the callout bar. To test manually, focus the editable area and tap 'Select' in the callout bar; the callout bar should appear again, with an option to 'Copy'. The 'Select All' action should not be shown.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
