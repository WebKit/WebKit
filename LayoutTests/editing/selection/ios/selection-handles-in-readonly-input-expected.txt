Verifies that dragging a selection handle outside of a readonly input does not cause the selection to jump outside of the input.

To manually test, double-tap to select the word "aa", drag the selection end handle out of the bounds of the input, and then drag the selection handle back in.

"aa" should remain selected.

This test is best run under WebKitTestRunner.
