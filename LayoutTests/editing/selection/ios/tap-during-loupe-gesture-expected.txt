This test verifies that the UI process doesn't hang if the user taps during a loupe gesture if focus is inside editable content in a same-origin child frame. To run the test manually, long press and drag on the page with one finger, and tap the page several times with the other finger at the same time. The UI process should not permanently hang as a result.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
