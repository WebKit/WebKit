<body contenteditable="true">
<p>This tests for setting the selection at a position inside the document when the document node is non-editable and the document's body element *is* editable.  The expected behavior is to create a selection at [body, 0]. There should be a caret at the start of this paragraph.</p>

</body>                
<script>
var sel = window.getSelection();
sel.setPosition(document, 0);
</script>
