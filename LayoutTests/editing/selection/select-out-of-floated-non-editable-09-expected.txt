block-level text before floats
first float*second float
To test manually, drag from the middle of the 'first-float' div to the right, into the space after the 'second float' element. The selection should go to the end of the 'second float' element and not jump to the beginning.

SUCCESS: Selected test is 'float*second float' as expected
