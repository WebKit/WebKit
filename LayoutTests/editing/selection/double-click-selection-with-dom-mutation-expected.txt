This test is for bug where selection vanishes when selection is created by Double-Click on text and then DOM is modified. Expected Output is that selected text should remain selected

Before::
| "Double-click to select "
| <span>
|   id="target"
|   "→this←"
| " text."

After::
| "Double-click to select "
| <span>
|   id="target"
|   "→"
|   "<#selection-anchor>this<#selection-focus>"
|   "←"
| " text."
