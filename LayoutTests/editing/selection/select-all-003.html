Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so
conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met here on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a
final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
