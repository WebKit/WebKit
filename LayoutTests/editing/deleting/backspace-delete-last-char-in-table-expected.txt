In this test the last character of a single-cell table is deleted, just using the backspace key. Only the table cell's content should be deleted, and not the table itself.

BeforeDeletion:
| "First"
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         id="test"
|         "1<#selection-caret>"
| "Second"

AfterDeletion:
| "First"
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         id="test"
|         <#selection-caret>
|         <br>
| "Second"
