<p>This tests deleting a selection that ends just before a space. There was a bug where it would be treated like a smart delete (the space would be incorrectly removed).  To run it outside of DRT, you must delete manually.  Press delete and you should see "Th is a test".</p>
<div id="div" contenteditable="true">This is a test.</div>

<script>
if (window.testRunner)
    window.testRunner.dumpAsText();

text = document.getElementById("div").firstChild;
window.getSelection().setBaseAndExtent(text, 2, text, 4);
if (window.eventSender)
    eventSender.keyDown("delete");
</script>
