This test verifies merging of second paragraph containing non-editable element with first paragraph does not cause loss of element in second paragraph.
Expected behavior is on hitting backspace all three word (First, Second and Third) should be visible and merged at the end of first line.

Before:
| "\n        "
| <p>
|   "First Paragraph."
| "\n        "
| <p>
|   id="paragraph"
|   "<#selection-caret>First"
|   <span>
|     class="noteditable"
|     contenteditable="false"
|     "Second"
|   "Third"
| "\n    "

After:
| "\n        "
| <p>
|   "First Paragraph.<#selection-caret>First"
|   <span>
|     class="noteditable"
|     "Second"
|   "Third"
| "\n    "
