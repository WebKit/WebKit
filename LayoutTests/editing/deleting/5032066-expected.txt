This tests deleting when the caret is at the start of a paragraph just after a table.  The content in that paragraph should be moved into the last table cell unless that content is another table.
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "All the content in this editable region <#selection-caret>should be in one table cell."
