This tests to see that selected non-editable nodes that are not in both the start and end editable root are preserved during a deletion.  You should see two 'Non-editable' pieces on either side of the editable piece below. <radr://problem/5026848>
| "\n"
| <table>
|   contenteditable="false"
|   "\n    "
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       "\n        "
|       <td>
|         "Non-editable"
|       "\n        "
|       <td>
|         contenteditable="true"
|         "Editable <#selection-caret>content"
|       "\n        "
|       <td>
|         "Non-editable"
|       "\n    "
