Testcase for bug 120006: <br> does not get deleted when inlined after some non-textual content. To manually verify this issue, place the caret at the start of the second line and then do a back-delete (backspace). The two lines should then be merged and the caret should get placed after the text control.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS caretRect.left is expectedCaretRect.left
PASS caretRect.top is expectedCaretRect.top
