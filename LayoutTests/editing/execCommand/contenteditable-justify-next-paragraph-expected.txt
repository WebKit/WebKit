This test is for a bug when selection extends complete line on first paragraph and applying justifyCenter command will be applied to next paragraph also. Only first Paragraph with id "paragraph1" should have attribute style="text-align: center"
| "\n    "
| <p>
|   id="paragraph1"
|   style="text-align: center;"
|   "<#selection-anchor>Paragraph one."
| "\n    "
| <p>
|   id="paragraph2"
|   <#selection-focus>
|   "Paragraph two."
| "\n"
