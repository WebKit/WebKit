This tests for a crash when removing format from two paragraphs that are inside blocks with different block properties than the blocks surrounding them. You should see two left aligned paragraphs below. It demonstrates a bug: RemoveFormat doesn't always reset text alignment


<div style="text-align: right;">
<div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">foo<br>bar</div>
</div>
