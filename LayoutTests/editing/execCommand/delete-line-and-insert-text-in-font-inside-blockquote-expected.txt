This tests deleting a line inside a font element inside a blockquote.

There should be exactly one blockquote and you should see "hello world" below:
| "\n"
| <blockquote>
|   style="background-color:yellow"
|   <br>
|   <font>
|     style="color:blue"
|     "hello<#selection-caret> world\n"
| "\n"
