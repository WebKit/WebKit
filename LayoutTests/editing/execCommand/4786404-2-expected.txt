This tests for a bug where performing the Remove Format operation on a selection that started in underlined content would underline everything operated on. "foo bar baz" should not have underline.
| <div>
|   contenteditable="true"
|   id="div"
|   "<#selection-anchor>foo"
|   " bar baz<#selection-focus>"
