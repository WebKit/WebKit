This tests indenting into a new blockquote when blockquotes are styled as -webkit-user-select: all. -webkit-user-select: all causes the new blockquote element to be uneditable so we should bail out and not indent.


On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS No blockquote created
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
