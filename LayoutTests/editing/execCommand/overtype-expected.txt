This is a test for Overwrite mode

These are the original contents:
| "
"
| <b>
|   "foo"
| <a>
|   href="http://www.google.com/"
|   <div>
|     id="linkText"
|     "bar"
| "
"

After overwritting the first two characters:
| "
"
| <b>
|   "FO<#selection-caret>o"
| <a>
|   href="http://www.google.com/"
|   <div>
|     id="linkText"
|     "bar"
| "
"

After inserting a blank:
| "
"
| <b>
|   "FO<#selection-caret> "
| <a>
|   href="http://www.google.com/"
|   <div>
|     id="linkText"
|     "bar"
| "
"

Overwrite at the end of a line performs as a normal Insert:
| "
"
| <b>
|   "FOO SOME MORE<#selection-caret>"
| <a>
|   href="http://www.google.com/"
|   <div>
|     id="linkText"
|     "bar"
| "
"

Overwritting works even if the inserted text is longer than the replaced text:
| "
"
| <b>
|   "FOO SOME MORE"
| <a>
|   href="http://www.google.com/"
|   <div>
|     id="linkText"
|     "BAR.BAR<#selection-caret>"
| "
"

Overwrite should create new text nodes on demand:
| "
"
| <b>
|   "FOO SOME MORE"
| <div>
|   id="linkText"
|   <a>
|     href="http://www.google.com/"
|     "BAR.BAR"
|   <br>
|   "TEXT IN NEW NODE<#selection-caret>"
| "
"

New plain text contents with an inner selection:
| "we<#selection-anchor>bk<#selection-focus>it"

Overwrite behaves like insert on range selections:
| "weBK<#selection-caret>it"

New CJK contents:
| "丠両丢丣"

Overwrite CJK text:
| "且且<#selection-caret>丢丣"

New RTL contents:
| <div>
|   dir="rtl"
|   id="rtl-div"
|   "ℵℶℷℸ"

Overwrite RTL text:
| <div>
|   dir="rtl"
|   id="rtl-div"
|   "אא<#selection-caret>ℷℸ"
