<p>This tests Indent on a selection that ends at the start of a paragraph.  Since we don't paint the gap before the paragraph for most selections like this, we don't perform Indent on the paragraph that the selection ends in.</p>
<div id="div" contenteditable="true">
This paragraph should be indented.<br>
This paragraph should not be indented.</br>
</div>

var sel = window.getSelection();
sel.setPosition(div, 0);
sel.modify("extend", "forward", "line");
