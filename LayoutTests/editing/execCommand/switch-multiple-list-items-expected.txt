This tests switching the list type of multiple list items at once. WebKit should not crash.

One, Two, and Three should all be in a single ol, each followed by a single br.:
| <ol>
|   <li>
|     "<#selection-anchor>One"
|     <br>
|   <li>
|     "Two"
|     <br>
|   <li>
|     "Three<#selection-focus>"
|     <br>
