This tests outdenting "two", the second paragraph in a regular blockquote (not created by WebKit). After outdenting two, there should be exactly two blockquotes.

one
two
three
Before: <blockquote id="test">one<br>two<br>three</blockquote>
After: <blockquote id="test">one<br></blockquote><div>two</div><blockquote>three</blockquote>
