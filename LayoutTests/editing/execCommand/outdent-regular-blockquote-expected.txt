This tests outdenting "two", the second paragraph in a regular blockquote (not created by WebKit). After outdenting two, there should be exactly two blockquotes.

one
two
three
Before: <blockquote id="test">one<br>two<br>three</blockquote>
After: <blockquote id="test">one<br></blockquote>two<br><blockquote>three</blockquote>
