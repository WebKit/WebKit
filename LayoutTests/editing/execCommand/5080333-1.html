<p>This tests for a bug where changing the alignment of an image would result in a selection that wasn't the one that was present before the alignment change.  The image should be centered and the caret should be the same before and after the operation.</p>
<div id="div" contenteditable="true">foo<br><img src="../resources/abe.png"><br>baz</div>

<script>
var div = document.getElementById("div");
var sel = window.getSelection();

sel.setPosition(div, 0);
sel.modify("move", "forward", "paragraphBoundary");
sel.modify("move", "forward", "character");

document.execCommand("JustifyCenter");
</script>
