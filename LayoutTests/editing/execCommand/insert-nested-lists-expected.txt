Verifies that 'InsertNestedUnorderedList' and 'InsertNestedOrderedList' work as expected. This test requires WebKitTestRunner or DumpRenderTree.

After unordered list insertion:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo<#selection-caret>"
|     <br>

After typing and ordered sublist insertion:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar<#selection-caret>"

After the second unordered list insertion:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar"
|     <ul>
|       <li>
|         <#selection-caret>

After undoing the last list insertion:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar<#selection-caret>"

After redoing the last list insertion:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar"
|     <ul>
|       <li>
|         <#selection-caret>

After selecting a range and inserting another unordered list:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar"
|     <ul>
|       <li>
|         <#selection-caret>
|       <ul>
|         <li>

After outdenting:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar"
|     <li>
|       <#selection-caret>
|       <br>
|     <ul>
|       <ul>
|         <li>

After outdenting again:
| <ul>
|   <li>
|     "foo"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <li>
|       "bar"
|   <li>
|     "baz<#selection-caret>"
|     <br>
|   <ol>
|     <ul>
|       <ul>
|         <li>
