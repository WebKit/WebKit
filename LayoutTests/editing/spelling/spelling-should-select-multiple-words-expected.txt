Spell check should select multi-word misspellings on context click. To test manually, enable 'Ask Google for Suggestions' in Chrome, type 'It should be upper case.', and context-click on the word 'upper'. The test succeeds when 'upper case' was selected after context click.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
