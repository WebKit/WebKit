WebKit should not crash after the text has changed and results are served from cache. To test manually, type 'Spell wellcome. Is it broken?', delete the words 'Is it broken?'. The test succeeds when WebKit does not crash and 'wellcome' has spelling marker.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS internals.markerCountForNode(destination.childNodes[0], "spelling") became different from 0
PASS window.getSelection().toString() is " Is it broken?"
PASS misspellingString() became "wellcome"
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
