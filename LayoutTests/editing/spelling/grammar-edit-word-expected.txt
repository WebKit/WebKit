Test if WebKit removes grammar markers when we edit a grammatically-incorrect word. To test manually, press backspace key to delete the last character of "has". This test succeeds when "ha" does not have grammar markers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


document.execCommand("InsertText", false, "You has the right.")
PASS internals.hasGrammarMarker(4, 3) became true
Delete the end of this sentence until it becomes "You ha".
