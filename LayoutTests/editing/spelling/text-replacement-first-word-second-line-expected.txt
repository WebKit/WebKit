To manually test, add an automatic text replacement mapping from the string '**' to 'stars'. Then, on the second line (this is imporatant, it must not be the first line) of a contenteditable, type the string '**'. It should not be immediately corrected to 'stars'. Type any other character, which should then change '**' to 'stars'.

After typing possible replacment:
| "
        "
| <div>
|   <br>
| <div>
|   "**<#selection-caret>"
| "
        "
| <div>
|   <br>
| "
    "

After pressing enter:
| "
        "
| <div>
|   <br>
| <div>
|   "stars"
| <div>
|   <#selection-caret>
|   <br>
| "
        "
| <div>
|   <br>
| "
    "
