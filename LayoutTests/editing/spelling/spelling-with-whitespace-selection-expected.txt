Spelling should ignore whitespace. To test manually, type 'hello, wellcome home.', select ' wellcome '. The test succeeds when 'wellcome' has spelling marker.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS spellingMarkerRange.toString() is "wellcome"
PASS window.getSelection().toString() is " wellcome "
PASS spellingMarkerRange.toString() became "wellcome"
