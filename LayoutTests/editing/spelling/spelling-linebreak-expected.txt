Misspellings should be preserved when a line-break command splits a text node. You should see 'Hello,zz a' on the first line below, and 'a' on the second line. This test succeeds when 'zz' (and only 'zz') is marked as misspelled.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
