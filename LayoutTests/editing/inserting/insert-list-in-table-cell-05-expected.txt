Exec insertOrderedList twice in a single cell of a table row removes the previously inserted list item:

Before:
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         id="element"
|         "<#selection-anchor>fsdf<#selection-focus>"
|       <td>
|         "fsdf"
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "gghfg"
|       <td>
|         "fsfg"

After:
| <table>
|   border="1"
|   <tbody>
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         id="element"
|         "<#selection-anchor>fsdf<#selection-focus>"
|         <br>
|       <td>
|         "fsdf"
|     <tr>
|       <td>
|         "gghfg"
|       <td>
|         "fsfg"
