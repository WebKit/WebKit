This test demonstrates that smart link doesn't erroneously trigger when the user moves the caret immediately before an URL.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


To manually run this test, disable "Check Spelling While Typing" and enable "Smart Link". The caret should be shown immediately after "zz" below:

PASS editor.selectionStart is 3
PASS editor.selectionEnd is 3
