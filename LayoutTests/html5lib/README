These are tests from the html5lib project.

*.dat files should be kept synced from:
https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/browse/#hg%2Ftestdata%2Ftree-construction
to resources/*.dat

./generate-test-wrappers

is used to generate .html file wrappers for the .dat files.

We generate both -write.html and -data.html wrappers for each .dat file.

"write" tests use document.write
"data" tests use data: urls, and enable the threaded parser if available.
