<p>The table below should have two columns and a total of 7 cells,
arranged in an alternating/overlapping fashion. The cellspacing=0 for
this table. In Nav4.5, this example can be viewed. In 5.0 (jun08
win95), this example displays (apparently) as a simple 2x2 table
(i.e., some elements are not displayed at all). (The numbers are the
position of each TD in the HTML source).</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">1</td>
    <td height="20">2</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">3</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">4</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">5</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">6</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td height="20">7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This is the same table as above, but cellspacing=5 in this case. For 5.0,
(jun08 win95) notice the odd cellspacing overlaps. See also bug #6304.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">1</td>
    <td height="20">2</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">3</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">4</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">5</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td rowspan="2" height="40">6</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td height="20">7</td>
