<p>This is a simple example of table height problems with only a single table. 
</p>
<p>The indention here is to specify a table with two rows. The table has a fixed 
  overall width (200 for the example) and two rows. The first row 'just high enough' 
  for a title line, and the second contains the rest. Creating such a table is 
  hamperd by a number of bugs</p>
<ol>
  <li>If a height is specified for only one row (not both) then it will be ignored 
  </li>
  <li> If specified heights are insufficient (because the content is too large) 
    then the entire table will be expanded. </li>
  <li>Percentage heights appear to simply be translated into pixel heights prior 
    to other processing, so offer no additional solutions </li>
</ol>
<p>This following table ought to give the desired results (small title line, large 
  body)</p>
<p>It is specifiable as </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Table height: 200<br>
    First Row : 1 or 1% <i>(i.e. expand to minimum required)</i><br>
    Second Row : unspecified <i> (i.e. table height - height of other rows+borders) 
    </i> </p>
</blockquote>
<table height=200 border=1>
<tr>
   <td height=20>  title line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>  rest of space</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This doesn't work because of the 1st bug above. </p>
<p>A second attempt is to specify heights that do add up to the total.</p>
<p> Table height: 200<br>
  First Row : 1<br>
  Second Row : 199 </p>
<table height=200 border=1>
<tr>
   <td height=1>  title line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td height=199>  rest of space</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This appears ok, but close inspection will show that the table is now >200 
  pixels high (2rd bug). </p>
<p>A third attempt using 1% and 99% gives identical results (3rd bug).</p>
<p> A related bug is the the height of a row that is not specified explicitly 
  cannot be used by its children. </p>
<p>This example is a table of height 200 with a single row of unspecified height. 
  This contains a DIV whose style is height:100%. It ought to fill the entire 
  table. </p>
<table height=200 border=1>
<tr>
<td>
<div style="height:100%;background-color:red">A 100% div inside a row of unspecified height</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
