<p>The table below should be sized so that each word of text wraps to its own line,
and if the font size is not too large, then the table will not be wider than the screen.</p>

<p>
Previously, the table would be incredibly wide, wide enough so that the entire paragraph of text
was on one line. That was because the "maxElementSize" of the cell was including margins calculated
from the desired size of the text (in this case, 19x the desired width of the paragraph). The fix
was to calculate the margin for the "maxElementSize" of the cell using the "maxElementSize" of the
contained block itself, which in this case is the maximum width of a word.
</p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr><td>
      <p style="margin-left: 95%;">This is some text. This is some text.</p> 
    </td></tr>
  </table>
