This page shows a difference between IE and Netscape 6 rendering of tables / cells with heights expressed in percentages.
<p>
The table A below has two cells.  Cell A1 contains an invisible image to make the cell fairly tall.  Cell A2 has a height attribute of 100%, and contains another table, table B.
<p>
Table B has two cells, B1 and B2.  B1 has a fixed pixel height of 30 pixels.  B2 has a height of 100%.  In IE, this causes B2 to stretch to fill the entire height of cell A2, while in Netscape 6 / Gecko, it seems to have no impact on the height of cell A2.
