        LayoutTests/imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/service-workers/service-worker/fetch-event.https.html should not expect Upgrade-Insecure Requests header
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181286

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Test previously expected upgrade-insecure-requests header to be inserted in a HTTP request.
        Given the request URL is HTTPS, there is no need for that header.

        Implement  https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#main-fetch default referrer policy setting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181239

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Updated test to output more tests for better error reporting.
        Also updated to relax the settings so that HTTP loads are done even though the page is HTTPS.
        Updated referrer computation since it should be done based on the fetch context and not its parent context.
