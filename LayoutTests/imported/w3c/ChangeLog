    While we would consider the unanimated style of CSS Animations specifically when considering what the "start" style values (before-change style in spec terminology)
    should be when considering whether to start a CSS Transition during style resolution, we would not consider other types of animations, specifically JS-created Web
    Animations. However, Web Platform Tests specifically test whether changes made using the Web Animations API may trigger transitions, and until now they would because
    the RenderStyle used to determine the before-change style was the style from the previous resolution, which would include animated values.
    
    To fix this, we make it so that KeyframeEffect objects now keep a copy of the unanimated style used when blending animated values for the very first time. That style
    is cleared each time keyframes change, which is rare, but may happen through the Web Animations API. Then in AnimationTimeline::updateCSSTransitionsForElementAndProperty(),
    we look for a KeyframeEffect currently affecting the property for which we're considering starting a CSS Transition, and use its unanimated style.
    
    If that unanimated style has not been set yet, this is because the KeyframeEffect has not had a chance to apply itself with a non-null progress. In this case, the before-change
    and after-change styles should be the same in order to prevent a transition from being triggered as the unanimated style for this keyframe effect will most likely be this
    after-change style, or any future style change that may happen before the keyframe effect starts blending animated values.
    
    Finally, tracking the unanimated style at the KeyframeEffect level means we no longer to track it specifically for CSSAnimation.

    [Web Animations] Support multiple CSS Animations with the same name in animation-name

    AnimationTimeline would keep track of registered CSS Animations by name for a given element in m_elementToCSSAnimationByName which would map one CSSAnimation
    per String (the animation-name) for a given Element. However, within the same animation-name property, the name of a given @keyframes rules may appear more
    than once, and the CSS Animations specification explains how to handle this scenario.
    
    We now correctly handle this by replacing m_elementToCSSAnimationByName with the new m_elementToCSSAnimationsCreatedByMarkupMap which simply maps an Element
    to a ListHashSet of CSSAnimation objects. Removing the string that appeared in animation-name to create this animation requires us to keep the AnimationList
    used for the last style update for sorting purposes, since having multiple instances of the same string would not allow disambiguation when sorting the
    KeyframeEffectStack.
    
    So we also replace m_cssAnimationNames, a Vector<String>, with m_cssAnimationList, a RefPtr<const AnimationList>, and use this to compare Animation objects
    stored in the AnimationList against the backing animation of each CSSAnimation.
    
    Storing the AnimationList on the KeyframeEffectStack also has the benefit of allowing us to use this as the previous state when updating CSS Animations in
    AnimationTimeline::updateCSSAnimationsForElement(). We used to rely on the previous RenderStyle provided to that function, but it's possible that this style
    is null and we would unnecessarily create additional CSSAnimation objects for animations that actually were retained since the last time CSS Animations were
    invalidated. We now use the stored AnimationList on the invalidated element's KeyframeEffectStack and create a new animation list that will replace the old
    list stored in the m_elementToCSSAnimationsCreatedByMarkupMap map for that element. We can also compare the old list with the new list to find out which
    animations are no longer current.
    
    Finally, we refactor things a bit to have some new aliases AnimationCollection and CSSAnimationCollection instead of using ListHashSet<> in our types.
    
    * animation/AnimationTimeline.cpp:
    (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::animationWasAddedToElement): Use the new AnimationCollection alias.
    (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::removeDeclarativeAnimationFromListsForOwningElement): We no longer need to do any work for CSSAnimation here since the
    m_elementToCSSAnimationByName map is no more and the m_elementToCSSAnimationsCreatedByMarkupMap that replaces it is updated in updateCSSAnimationsForElement()
    and elementWasRemoved().
    (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::animationsForElement const): Since animations are correctly sorted accounting for their composite order in KeyframeEffectStack,
    call KeyframeEffectStack::sortedEffects() when we're called with Ordering::Sorted.
    (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::removeCSSAnimationCreatedByMarkup): New method called by elementWasRemoved() to ensure that when an element is removed, we remove
    its CSSAnimation objects from the new m_elementToCSSAnimationsCreatedByMarkupMap and also update the AnimationList on the relevant KeyframeEffectStack.

        The test triggers a registration update and then expects registration.installing to be non-null
        once the registration update promise is resolved. This is only true if the content of the service
        worker script is different since last update. The script included a timestamp to try and make
        the script different every time but it would sometimes not suffice if the update happens quickly
        enough. To address the issue, include a UUID in the script instead of a timestamp.

        [GTK][WPE] Support Pointer Events

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        * web-platform-tests/resources/testdriver-vendor.js:
        The fix for iOS added in r245639 triggers a call to sendEventStream in
        UIScriptController that crashes on GTK because that function is only
        implemented for iOS. For Mac this was not an issue because the Mac port
        doesn't enable TouchEvent support ("createTouch" in document).
        However TouchEvent support is enabled for GTK. Fix this by only
        trigerring the call to dispatchTouchActions when TouchEvent support
        is enabled _and_ its iOS.

        Update css/support directory in WPT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203452

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Various WPT are relying on new functionality in css/support (e.g. test_shorthand_value).
        In addition, the behavior for testing computed style of properties which don't exist has changed,
        causing changes in test output.

        Negative radii in radial gradients should be rejected.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202412

        Per the spec, https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images-3/#radial-gradients
        "Negative values are invalid.",
        we reject negative radii values in radial-gradient.

        This patch rejects negative radii during radial-gradient parsing
        for both webkit prefixed and non-prefixed ones.

        Rubber-stamped by Sam Weinig.

        Sync shadow DOM tests as of e33c216e635b4615e4332953fcb758f698ecd510. Also added enough support for
        sending key events so that sequential focusing tests would work.

        Make table's clientWidth/Height include its border sizes.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200974

        WebKit doesn't have table wrapper box currently
        while Gecko has it,
        so this CL tries to mimic the behavior that
        clientWidth/Height refers to table wrapper box
        which doesn't have borders applied to itself
        and table grid box has the borders.

        This CL adds table's border sizes
        to clientWidth/Height
        at |LayoutBox::PixelSnappedClientWidth/Height|.

        As a result of this CL, table's clientWidth/Height
        and offsetWidth/Height are equal now, respectively.

        <rdar://problem/55240851>

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        The last test's cleanup step was very complex (involving waiting for a promise to get resolved) and WebKit's
        completion handler in testharnessreport.js was often getting called before the promise resolution, leaving
        the test frame in the output when we call notifyDone(). This seems like a potential bug in testharness.js.
        To address the issue for now, do the unregistration in the test's body and only remove the test frame in
        the cleanup step.

        proves the correct implementation of the chorded button interactions section of the Pointer Events spec. To do that,
        we also had to make use of the "button" parameter used in WPT tests action sequences, which allows the test to indicate
        which mouse button is pressed. Finally, there is now a change in the pointerevent_pointermove_on_chorded_mouse_button.html

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        WPT actions sequences may move the pointer prior to pressing it down. In this case, we need to make sure we don't
        end up queuing a "moved" touch and instead save the pointer position for when the pointer is pressed. It's important
        to also generate a different touch id for each time we pause or end a touch sequence. This allows a few more WPT
        touch tests to pass without any source change in our Pointer Events implementation.

        Before this CL, sticky element's layout was executed relative to
        a box's overflow container,
        but the value returned by getComputedStyle was resolved against
        its containing block.

        So, the computed value and the actual value used in layout
        was different before this change.

        [GTK][WPE] Disable "thin", "thick", "medium" values of mfrac@linethickness at runtime

        This patch introduces some experimental runtime flag to let users

        Imported additonal WPT from the CSS Text Suite that verify the
        change doesn't regress in any case, specially for the word-break:

        [css-grid] Fix grid container baseline alignment for orthogonal items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196141

        Reviewed by Javier Fernandez.

        Imported test from WPT. This patch is making some of the test cases pass but not all.
        Some are still failing in WebKit as it never uses the central baseline on vertical writing modes (bug #94410),
        also "text-orientation" is not supported yet in WebKit (bug #196139),
        even the prefixed version "-webkit-text-orientation" doesn't fix anything in this test case.

        navigator.serviceWorker returns null after the frame has been detached. The test has been written
        this way because this is how Chromium behaves. However, Firefox keeps returning the
        ServiceWorkerContainer, as we do. Also, the specification indicates the the attribute cannot
        return null (since the attribute is not nullable):

        Resolve inset properties to computed style when there is overconstraintment
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188711

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        This patch makes WebKit behave closer to Blink. Specifically,
         - In overconstrained relative or absolute positioning, inset properties resolve
           to the computed value (absolutizing percentages) instead of to the used value.
         - In fixed positioning, the resolved value of non-'auto' values is no longer
           increased by the border of the containg block.

        Some tests still have failures due to
         - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189513
         - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189518
         - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189549

        This patch can slighlty alter the resolved value if it's a long decimal number,
        that's why test expectations for the timing functions test changed.

        Capturing event listeners are called during bubbling phase for shadow hosts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174288

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        * web-platform-tests/dom/events/Event-dispatch-handlers-changed-expected.txt: Rebaselined. This test's
        expectation is now wrong because event listner 3 is added after the event listener list is cloned for
        capturing event listeners but before cloned for bubbling event listeners. As a result, event listener 3
        is now invoked. It used to be not called because both bubbling and capturing event listeners are called
        after cloning the event listner list once, which didn't have event listener 3.

        * web-platform-tests/dom/events/EventTarget-dispatchEvent-expected.txt: Rebaselined. This test expects
        event listener 2, which is bubbling, to be called between two capturing event listeners 1 and 3, which
        is no longer true after this patch.
