PASS Origin of Blob URL matches our origin
PASS Blob URL parses correctly
PASS Origin of Blob URL matches our origin for Files
PASS Blob URLs can be used in <script> tags
FAIL Blob URLs can be used in iframes, and are treated same origin Sandbox access violation: Blocked a frame at "null" from accessing a cross-origin frame.  Both frames are sandboxed and lack the "allow-same-origin" flag.
