PASS Returns an IDBIndex and the properties are set correctly
PASS Attempt to create an index that requires unique values on an object store already contains duplicates
PASS The index is usable right after being made
PASS Event ordering for a later deleted index
PASS Empty keyPath
PASS Event order when unique constraint is triggered
PASS Event ordering for ConstraintError on request
PASS Index can be valid keys
PASS IDBObjectStore.createIndex() - empty name
PASS If an index with the name name already exists in this object store, the implementation must throw a DOMException of type ConstraintError
PASS If keyPath is not a valid key path, the implementation must throw a DOMException of type SyntaxError
PASS If the object store has been deleted, the implementation must throw a DOMException of type InvalidStateError
PASS Operate out versionchange throw InvalidStateError
PASS InvalidStateError(Incorrect mode) vs. TransactionInactiveError. Mode check should precede state check of the transaction.
PASS InvalidStateError(Deleted ObjectStore) vs. TransactionInactiveError. Deletion check should precede transaction-state check.
PASS TransactionInactiveError vs. ConstraintError. Transaction-state check should precede index name check.
PASS ConstraintError vs. SyntaxError. Index name check should precede syntax check of the key path
PASS SyntaxError vs. InvalidAccessError. Syntax check should precede multiEntry check of the key path.
PASS Explicit Primary Key
PASS Auto-Increment Primary Key
PASS Auto-Increment Primary Key - invalid key values elsewhere
