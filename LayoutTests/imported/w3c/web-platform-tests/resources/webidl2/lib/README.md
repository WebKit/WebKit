This directory contains a built version of the [webidl2.js library](https://github.com/w3c/webidl2.js).
It is built by running `npm run build-debug` at the root of that repository.

Currently using webidl2.js@24.1.1 (372ea83eaa10f60adff49bd0f4f3ce6a11d6fbec).

The `webidl2.js.headers` file is a local addition to ensure the script is interpreted as UTF-8.
