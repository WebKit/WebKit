Viewport: Resize Event On Load Overflowing Page

Test Description: This test ensures that we fire a resize event against window.visualViewport if the page has overflow (since this creates a scrollbar and thus changes the viewport size).


PASS Resize event fired exactly once against window.visualViewport if scrollbars affect layout.
