PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS Performance interface object length 
PASS Performance interface object name 
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object 
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property 
PASS Performance interface: operation now() 
FAIL Performance interface: attribute timeOrigin assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "timeOrigin" expected true got false
FAIL Performance interface: operation toJSON() assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toJSON" missing
PASS Performance must be primary interface of window.performance 
PASS Stringification of window.performance 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "now()" with the proper type 
FAIL Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "timeOrigin" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "timeOrigin" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "toJSON()" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "toJSON" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Test default toJSON operation of Performance memberHolderObject.toJSON is not a function. (In 'memberHolderObject.toJSON()', 'memberHolderObject.toJSON' is undefined)
PASS Window interface: attribute performance 
PASS Window interface: window must inherit property "performance" with the proper type
