PASS Performance interface: operation now() 
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for now() on Performance 
FAIL Performance interface: attribute timeOrigin assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "timeOrigin" expected true got false
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for timeOrigin property on Performance 
FAIL Performance interface: operation toJSON() assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toJSON" missing
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for toJSON() on Performance 
PASS Performance must be primary interface of [object Performance] 
PASS Stringification of [object Performance] 
PASS Performance interface: [object Performance] must inherit property "now()" with the proper type 
FAIL Performance interface: [object Performance] must inherit property "timeOrigin" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "timeOrigin" not found in prototype chain
