PASS delayed handling: a microtask delay before attaching a handler prevents both events (Promise.reject-created promise)
PASS delayed handling: a microtask delay before attaching a handler prevents both events (immediately-rejected new Promise-created promise)
PASS delayed handling: a microtask delay before attaching the handler, and before rejecting the promise, indirected through Promise.all

PASS microtask nesting: attaching a handler inside a combination of promise microtasks + mutationObserverMicrotask, all inside a setTimeout
PASS delayed handling: a nested-task delay before attaching a handler causes unhandledrejection
PASS delayed handling: a nested-queueTask after promise creation/rejection, plus promise microtasks, is too late to attach a rejection handler
PASS delayed handling: a nested-queueTask before promise creation/rejection, plus many promise microtasks, is too late to attach a rejection handler
PASS delayed handling: a nested-queueTask after promise creation/rejection, plus many promise microtasks, is too late to attach a rejection handler
PASS delayed handling: delaying handling by setTimeout(,10) will cause both events to fire
PASS delayed handling: delaying handling rejected promise created from createImageBitmap will cause both events to fire
PASS mutationObserverMicrotask vs. queueTask ordering is not disturbed inside unhandledrejection events
