idlharness test

This test validates the WebIDL included in the Timing control for script-based animations specification.

partial interface Window {
  long requestAnimationFrame(FrameRequestCallback callback);
  void cancelAnimationFrame(long handle);
};

callback FrameRequestCallback = void (DOMHighResTimeStamp time);

PASS Partial interface Window: original interface defined 
PASS Window interface: operation requestAnimationFrame(FrameRequestCallback) 
PASS Window interface: operation cancelAnimationFrame(long) 
PASS Window interface: window must inherit property "requestAnimationFrame(FrameRequestCallback)" with the proper type 
PASS Window interface: calling requestAnimationFrame(FrameRequestCallback) on window with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Window interface: window must inherit property "cancelAnimationFrame(long)" with the proper type 
PASS Window interface: calling cancelAnimationFrame(long) on window with too few arguments must throw TypeError
