User activation with 'contextmenu' event

Tests that a 'contextmenu' event is treated like a user activation.

Right-click or long-press on green.
Click or tap on Done.


FAIL 'contextmenu' can call vibrate. navigator.vibrate is not a function. (In 'navigator.vibrate(200)', 'navigator.vibrate' is undefined)
