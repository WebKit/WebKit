PASS Importing a specifier that previously failed due to an incorrect type attribute can succeed if the correct attribute is later given
FAIL Importing a specifier that previously succeeded with the correct type attribute should fail if the incorrect attribute is later given assert_unreached: Should have rejected: Dynamic import should fail with the type attribute missing even if the same specifier previously succeeded Reached unreachable code
FAIL Two modules of different type with the same specifier can load if the server changes its responses assert_equals: expected (string) "hello" but got (object) object "[object Object]"
PASS An import should always fail if the same specifier/type attribute pair failed previously
PASS If an import previously succeeded for a given specifier/type attribute pair, future uses of that pair should yield the same result
