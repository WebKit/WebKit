PASS close() fires a close event
PASS close() on a <dialog> that doesn't have an open attribute aborts the steps
PASS close() removes the open attribute and set the returnValue to the first argument
PASS close() without argument removes the open attribute and there's no returnValue
PASS close() should set the returnValue IDL attribute but not the JS property
