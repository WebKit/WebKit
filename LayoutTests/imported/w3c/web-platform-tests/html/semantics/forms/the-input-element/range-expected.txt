Input Range


PASS range type support on input element
PASS min attribute support on input element
PASS max attribute support on input element
PASS Illegal value of min attribute
PASS Illegal value of max attribute
PASS Converting an illegal string to the default value
PASS Illegal value of step attribute
PASS the value is set to min when a smaller value than min attribute is given
PASS the value is set to max when a larger value than max attribute is given
PASS default value of min attribute in input type=range
PASS default value of max attribute in input type=range
PASS default value when min and max attributes are given (= min plus half the difference between min and max)
PASS default value with step control when both min and max attributes are given
FAIL default value when both min and max attributes are given, while min > max assert_equals: expected "2" but got "51"
PASS The default step scale factor is 1, unless min attribute has non-integer value
PASS Step scale factor behavior when min attribute has integer value but max attribute is non-integer
FAIL The default scale factor is 1 even if step attribute is explicitly set to non-integer value, unless min attribute has non-integer value assert_equals: expected "1" but got "0.5"
PASS Solving the step mismatch
PASS Performing stepUp()
PASS Performing stepDown()
FAIL Performing stepUp() beyond the value of the max attribute The object is in an invalid state.
FAIL Performing stepDown() beyond the value of the min attribute The object is in an invalid state.
FAIL Skip ASCII whitespace within input assert_equals: expected "123" but got "50"
PASS Multiply value by ten raised to the exponentth power with `e`
PASS Multiply value by ten raised to the exponentth power with `E`
