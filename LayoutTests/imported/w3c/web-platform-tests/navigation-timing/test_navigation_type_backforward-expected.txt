Description

This test validates the value of window.performance.navigation.type with a forward and back navigation.

This page should be loaded with a yellow background frame below. It should turn green for a starting navigation, back to yellow for a back navigation and then back to green again for a forward navigation.

Along the navigation timeline the frame.window.performance.type is checked for TYPE_BACK_FORWARD.

This test passes if all of the checks to the navigation.type are correct throughout the navigation scenario and the frame below ends with a green background. Otherwise, this test fails.


PASS window.performance is defined
PASS window.performance.navigation is defined
PASS window.performance.navigation.type == TYPE_NAVIGATE
PASS window.performance.navigation.type == TYPE_BACK_FORWARD after history.back()
PASS window.performance.navigation.type == TYPE_BACK_FORWARD after history.forward()
