frame "<!--frame1-->" - has 1 onunload handler(s)
Description

This test validates the ordering of the window.performance.timing attributes.

This page should be loaded with a yellow background frame below which contains an unload event handler.

After the page loads, the frame is navigated to a new blank page with a green background. At this point, the navigation timeline is verified

This test passes if all of the checks to the frame.window.performance.timing attributes are correct throughout the navigation scenario and the frame below ends with a green background. Otherwise, this test fails.
