PASS Reversing an animation inverts the playback rate
PASS Reversing an animation plays a pausing animation
PASS Reversing an animation maintains the same current time
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to leave the pending state
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to resolve the ready promise
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the end
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the end
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the start
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the start
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should throw an exception
PASS When reversing throws an exception, the playback rate remains unchanged
PASS Reversing animation when playbackRate = 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should NOT throw an exception
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should make it play from the start
PASS Reversing when when playbackRate == 0 should preserve the current time and playback rate
PASS Reversing an idle animation from starts playing the animation
PASS Reversing an animation without an active timeline throws an InvalidStateError
PASS Reversing should use the negative pending playback rate
PASS When reversing fails, it should restore any previous pending playback rate
