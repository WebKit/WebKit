PASS Reversing an animation inverts the playback rate 
PASS Reversing an animation plays a pausing animation 
PASS Reversing an animation maintains the same current time 
FAIL Reversing an animation does not cause it to leave the pending state assert_true: The animation is pending before we call reverse expected true got false
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to resolve the ready promise 
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the end 
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the end 
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the start 
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the start 
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should throw an exception 
PASS When reversing throws an exception, the playback rate remains unchanged 
PASS Reversing animation when playbackRate = 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should NOT throw an exception 
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should make it play from the start 
PASS Reversing when when playbackRate == 0 should preserve the current time and playback rate 
FAIL Reversing an animation without an active timeline throws an InvalidStateError assert_throws: function "() => { animation.reverse(); }" did not throw
