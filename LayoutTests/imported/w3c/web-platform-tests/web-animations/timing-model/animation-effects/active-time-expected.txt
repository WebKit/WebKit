PASS Active time in before phase
PASS Active time in active phase and no start delay is the local time
PASS Active time in active phase and positive start delay is the local time minus the start delay
PASS Active time in active phase and negative start delay is the local time minus the start delay
PASS Active time in after phase with no fill is unresolved
PASS Active time in after phase with backwards-only fill is unresolved
PASS Active time in after phase with forwards fill is the active duration
PASS Active time in after phase with forwards fill, zero-duration, and  infinite iteration count is the active duration
PASS Active time in after phase with forwards fill and positive end delay is the active duration
PASS Active time in after phase with forwards fill and negative end delay is the active duration + end delay
PASS Active time in after phase with forwards fill and negative end delay greater in magnitude than the active duration is zero
PASS Active time in after phase with forwards fill and negative end delay greater in magnitude than the sum of the active duration and start delay is zero
PASS Active time in after phase with 'both' fill is the active duration
PASS Active time when the local time is unresolved, is unresolved
