just a guideline):

- [ ] Target the `master` branch for bug fixes, documentation updates and trivial changes.
- [ ] Target the `features` branch for new features and removals/deprecations.
- [ ] Include documentation when adding new features.
- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.

Unless your change is trivial or a small documentation fix (e.g.,  a typo or reword of a small section) please:
