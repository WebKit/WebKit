HTML-2-CSS Mapping

Checks that browsers implement properly the html2css stylesheet (rules without attributes)

You should see a 5 2px blue square here, separated by 2px each:
Because of the lack of the table element, border-spacing is 0; padding on each td should be 1px on each side. 1px*2*5=10px.

You should see a 10px blue square here:
Because of the lack of the table element, border-spacing is 0; padding on each td should be 1px on each side. 1px*2*5=10px.

You should see a 12px blue square here:
The table has the background; x-td elements have no padding, only the border-spacing remains. 6*2px=12px.

You shouldn't see anything here:
The table has the background but is empty; it does not apply border-spacing in this case.
