The orange boxes are position: fixed. Clicking ScrollIntoView in each box will attempt to scroll into view the blue target element inside that fixed container to block/inline: start (i.e. aligned with top left corner in RTL).

scrollIntoView from a position:fixed element must not scroll its containing frame; however, it must scroll further ancestor scrollers as the element isn't fixed in relation to them.
