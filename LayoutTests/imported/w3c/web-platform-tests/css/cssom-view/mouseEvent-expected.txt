Hello

PASS MouseEvent's x and y must be equal to clientX and clientY.
FAIL MouseEvent's pageX and pageY attributes should be the sum of the scroll offset and clientX/clientY assert_equals: expected 5020 but got 20
PASS MouseEvent's offsetX/offsetY attributes should be the same value as its pageX/pageY attributes.
