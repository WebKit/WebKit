This test checks that :focus-visible is not triggered by mouse focus on <input> elements which do not take text input.
If the user-agent does not claim to support the :focus-visible pseudo-class then SKIP this test.
Click each element element below to focus it.
If the element has a red outline, then the test result is FAILURE. If the element has a green background, then the test result is SUCCESS.
