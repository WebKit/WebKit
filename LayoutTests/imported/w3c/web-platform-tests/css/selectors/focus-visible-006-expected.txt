This test checks that :focus-visible always matches on elements with contenteditable=true set.
If the user-agent does not claim to support the :focus-visible pseudo-class then SKIP this test.
Click the content editable span below to focus it.
If the element has a red background, then the test result is FAILURE. If the element has a green outline, then the test result is SUCCESS.
