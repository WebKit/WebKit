This test checks that programmatically focusing an element after a keypress causes :focus-visible to match.
Use the tab key to move focus to the button below that says "Tab to me and press ENTER."
Press ENTER.
If the element that says "I will be focused programmatically." has a red background, then the test result is FAILURE. If the element has a green outline, then the test result is SUCCESS.

Tab to me and press ENTER.
I will be focused programmatically.

FAIL Programmatic focus after keypress should match :focus-visible assert_equals: outlineColor for DIV#el should be green expected "rgb(0, 128, 0)" but got "rgb(0, 0, 0)"
