This test checks that by default, using the mouse to focus a generic element does not show a focus ring (because it does not trigger :focus-visible matching).

Click on the element below that says "Click me."
If the element does not have a focus ring, then the test result is SUCCESS.
Click me.

PASS ":focus-visible" should be a valid selector
FAIL Mouse focus does not show a focus ring by default assert_equals: outline-style for DIV#target should be none expected "none" but got "auto"
