FAIL AnimationEffect.updateTiming({ duration }) causes changes to the animation-duration to be ignored assert_equals: Delay should be the value set by style expected 6000 but got 0
FAIL AnimationEffect.updateTiming({ iterations, direction }) causes changes to the animation-iteration-count and animation-direction to be ignored assert_equals: Delay should be the value set by style expected 6000 but got 0
FAIL AnimationEffect.updateTiming({ delay, fill }) causes changes to the animation-delay and animation-fill-mode to be ignored assert_equals: Iterations should be the value set by style expected 6 but got 1
FAIL AnimationEffect.updateTiming() does override to changes from animation-* properties if there is an error assert_equals: Duration should be the value set by style expected 4000 but got 100000
