PASS Same events are ordered by elements
PASS Same events on pseudo-elements follow the prescribed order
FAIL Same events on pseudo-elements follow the prescribed order (::marker) assert_equals: Number of events received (4) should match expected number (5) (expected: animationstart, animationstart, animationstart, animationstart, animationstart, actual: animationstart, animationstart, animationstart, animationstart) expected 5 but got 4
FAIL Start and iteration events are ordered by time assert_equals: Event #1 types should match (expected: animationiteration, animationstart, actual: animationstart, animationiteration) expected "animationiteration" but got "animationstart"
FAIL Iteration and end events are ordered by time assert_equals: Event #1 types should match (expected: animationiteration, animationend, actual: animationend, animationiteration) expected "animationiteration" but got "animationend"
FAIL Start and end events are sorted correctly when fired simultaneously assert_equals: Event #1 targets should match expected Element node <div style="animation: anim 100s 2"></div> but got Element node <div style="animation: anim 100s 100s"></div>
