FAIL Keyframes set using setKeyframes() are reflected in computed style for a running transition assert_equals: expected "200px" but got "0px"
PASS A transition with replaced keyframes still returns the original transitionProperty
PASS A transition with no keyframes still returns the original transitionProperty
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating the same property still exhibits normal reversing behavior. assert_approx_equals: The reversed transition has correctly reduced duration expected 50000 +/- 1 but got 100000
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating a different property still exhibits normal reversing behavior  (reversing from the base value). undefined is not an object (evaluating 'reversedTransition.effect')
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating nothing still exhibits normal reversing behavior (reversing from the base value). undefined is not an object (evaluating 'reversedTransition.effect')
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating nothing on a property being controlled by another modified transition exhibits normal reversing behavior and reverses from the other transition's current value. assert_approx_equals: The reversed transition has correctly reduced duration (based on the original left transition). expected 50000 +/- 1 but got 100000
FAIL A transition with replaced kefyrames and composite 'add' exhibits normal reversing behavior, and the effect is not double counted when calculating the before change style assert_equals: The computed style is based on the updated keyframes expected "175px" but got "75px"
