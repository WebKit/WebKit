PASS transition-behavior:allow-discrete should animate discrete properties.
PASS transition-behavior:allow-discrete overlaps the previous normal value.
PASS transition-behavior:normal overlaps the previous allow-discrete value.
PASS transition-behavior changed to normal should stop the running discrete transitions.
PASS transition-behavior:allow-discrete should animate for values fallback to discrete animations.
PASS transition-behavior:normal should cancel the running transitions whose animation values are not interpolatable
