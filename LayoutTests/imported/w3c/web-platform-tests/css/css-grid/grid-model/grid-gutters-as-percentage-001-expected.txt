Height is indefinite, so row gaps should be based on grid's 'auto' height. Column gaps based on a grid's 'auto' width, which will reduce the available space for tracks; however, they can grow exceeding their content's max-width.

Height is indefinite, so row gaps should be based on grid's 'auto' height. Column gaps based on a grid's 'instrinsic' width, which reduce the available space for tracks; however, since we use 'fit-content' intrinsic size, first column's width is reduced and height increased to let its content to fit.

Height is indefinite, so row gaps should be based on grid's 'auto' height. Column gaps based on a grid's 'intrinsic' width, which reduce the available space for tracks; however, they are fixed sized and don't fit so they overflow the grid container.

Both row and column gaps are based on definite sizes, but they will reduce the available space for tracks; however, since the container's specified inline size is not enough, first column's width is reduced and height increased to let its content to fit.

Height is indefinite, so row gaps should be based on grid's 'auto' height. Column gaps based on a grid's 'instrinsic' width, which reduce the available space for tracks; however, since we use 'fit-content' intrinsic size, only 1 repeteation is allowed, so tracks are adjusted to fit in the intrinsic size reduced by the gaps.
