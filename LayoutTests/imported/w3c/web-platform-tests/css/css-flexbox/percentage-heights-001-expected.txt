This test verifies that we consider flex items' cross sizes to be definite if the align value is stretch (the default)

Tests that we get a definite size in the simple case:

Tests that we get a definite size in a wrapping flexbox:

Tests that we get an indefinite size when not stretch-aligning, despite definite size on container:

Tests that we get a definite size in a definite-height flexbox:

Tests that we get a definite size in a nested flexbox where only the outer one has an explicit height:

Tests that we get a definite size in a nested flexbox where only the outer one has an explicit height and has an opposite direction:

Tests that we respect min-height, on child of a flex item with percent height that's treated as definite:

Tests that max-height also supports percentages:

Tests that percentage sizes can also be definite:

Tests that we use a definite size even when a percentage size is not definite
