Specified size suggestion = 200px
Content size suggestion = 150px [1]
Automatic minimum height = min(150px, 200px)

[1] fallback size from last bullet point in https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic-sizes :

For boxes without a preferred aspect ratio:
 * If the available space is definite in the appropriate dimension, use the stretch fit into that size in that dimension.
 * Otherwise, if the box has a  as its computed minimum size (min-width/min-height) in that dimension, use that size.
 * Otherwise, use 300px for the width and/or 150px for the height as needed.

Pass condition: there is a 150x150 green square.
