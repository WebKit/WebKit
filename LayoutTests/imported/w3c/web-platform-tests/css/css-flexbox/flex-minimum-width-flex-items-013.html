  <!--
    content size suggestion is 300px
    specified size suggestion is 100px

    Chrome 87 and Firefox 84a1 disagree about transferred size suggestion here
    (Chrome says undefined. Firefox says 300/150 * 25 = 50. See spec issue
    above.) but it doesn't matter: this test asserts that the transferred size
    suggestion is ignored, because of this from the spec (capitalization
    added):

    In general, the content-based minimum size of a flex item is the smaller of
    its content size suggestion and its specified size suggestion. However, if
    the box has an aspect ratio AND NO specified size, its content-based
    minimum size is the smaller of its content size suggestion and its
    transferred size suggestion.

    So here the content-based minimum size is min(300, 100) = 100.
