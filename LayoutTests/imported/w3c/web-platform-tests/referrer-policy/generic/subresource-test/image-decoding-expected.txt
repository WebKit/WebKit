Image decoding - cross-origin image request

If you can read JSON encoded HTTP headers of the image below, the decoding works as expected.

http://127.0.0.1:8800/common/security-features/subresource/image.py?cache_destroyer=1556308330222:

{
  "origin": "http://localhost:8800",
  "accept-language": "fr-fr",
  "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate",
  "host": "127.0.0.1:8800",
  "accept": "image/png,image/svg+xml,image/*;q=0.8,video/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.5",
  "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko)",
  "connection": "keep-alive",
  "referer": "http://localhost:8800/referrer-policy/generic/subresource-test/image-decoding.html"
}



PASS Image is encoding headers as JSON.
