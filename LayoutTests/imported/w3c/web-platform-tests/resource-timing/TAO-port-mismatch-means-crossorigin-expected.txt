Description

This test validates that for a cross origin resource with different ports, the timing allow check algorithm will fail when the value of Timing-Allow-Origin value has the right host but the wrong port in it.


FAIL A port mismatch must fail the TAO check promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: URL is not valid or contains user credentials."
FAIL An identical port must pass the TAO check promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: URL is not valid or contains user credentials."
