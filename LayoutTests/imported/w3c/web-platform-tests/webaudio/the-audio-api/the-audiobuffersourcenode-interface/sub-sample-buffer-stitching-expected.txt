PASS > [buffer-stitching-1] Subsample buffer stitching, same rates
PASS   Test 1: context.sampleRate is equal to 44100.
PASS   Stitched sine-wave buffers at sample rate 44100 equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.000090957,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS   SNR (85.58656138880359 dB) is greater than or equal to 85.58.
PASS < [buffer-stitching-1] All assertions passed. (total 3 assertions)
