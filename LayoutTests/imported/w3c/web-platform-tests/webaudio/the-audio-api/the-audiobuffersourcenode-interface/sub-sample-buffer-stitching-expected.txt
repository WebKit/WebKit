PASS > [buffer-stitching-1] Subsample buffer stitching, same rates
PASS   Test 1: context.sampleRate is equal to 44100.
PASS   Stitched sine-wave buffers at sample rate 44100 equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.000091,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS   SNR (85.586561 dB) is greater than or equal to 85.58.
PASS < [buffer-stitching-1] All assertions passed. (total 3 assertions)
PASS > [buffer-stitching-2] Subsample buffer stitching, different rates
PASS   Test 2: context.sampleRate is equal to 44100.
PASS   Stitched sine-wave buffers at sample rate 43800 equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.003899,"relativeThreshold":0}.
