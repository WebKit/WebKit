PASS > [detune limits] Oscillator with detune and frequency at Nyquist or above 
PASS   Context sample rate is equal to 44100. 
PASS   Reference oscillator frequency is greater than or equal to 22050. 
PASS   Osc(freq: 44100.00390625) output contains only the constant 0. 
PASS   Osc(freq: 1, detune: 18514.189453125) output equals [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0,"relativeThreshold":0}. 
PASS < [detune limits] All assertions passed. (total 4 assertions) 
PASS > [detune automation] Oscillator output with detune automation should be zero above Nyquist 
PASS   Frame where detuned oscillator reaches Nyquist is equal to 5. 
PASS   osc[0:4] is not constantly 0 (contains 4 different values).
