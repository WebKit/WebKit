PASS Audit report
PASS > [detune limits] Oscillator with detune and frequency at Nyquist or above
PASS   Context sample rate is equal to 44100.
PASS   Reference oscillator frequency is greater than or equal to 22050.
PASS   Osc(freq: 44100.003906) output contains only the constant 0.
PASS   Osc(freq: 1, detune: 18514.189453) output equals [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS < [detune limits] All assertions passed. (total 4 assertions)
PASS > [detune automation] Oscillator output with detune automation should be zero above Nyquist
PASS   Frame where detuned oscillator reaches Nyquist is equal to 5.
PASS   osc[0:4] is not constantly 0.
PASS   osc[5:] contains only the constant 0.
PASS < [detune automation] All assertions passed. (total 3 assertions)
PASS # AUDIT TASK RUNNER FINISHED: 2 tasks ran successfully.
