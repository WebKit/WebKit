PASS > [test mono input] Test StereoPanner with mono input has no dezippering
PASS   Mono: Left channel, pan = -1:  contains only the constant 1.
PASS   Mono: Right channel, pan = -1: contains only the constant 0.
PASS   Mono: Left channel, pan = 1:  equals [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":6.1233e-17,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS   Mono: Right channel, pan = 1: contains only the constant 1.
PASS < [test mono input] All assertions passed. (total 4 assertions)
