PASS > [ConstantSource k-rate offset]
PASS   k-rate offset: Setting offset.automationRate to "k-rate" is equal to k-rate.
PASS   k-rate offset: k-rate node: offset.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception.
PASS   k-rate offset: k-rate node: offset.linearRampToValueAtTime(10,0.064) did not throw an exception.
PASS   k-rate offset: a-rate node:offset.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception.
PASS   k-rate offset: a-rate node:offset.linearRampToValueAtTime(10,0.064) did not throw an exception.
PASS   k-rate offset: Output of k-rate ConstantSourceNode is identical to the array [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...].
PASS   k-rate offset: Output of a-rate ConstantSourceNode is identical to the array [expected array].
PASS   k-rate offset: Difference between a-rate and k-rate ConstantSourceNode is not constantly 0.
PASS   k-rate offset k-rate output [0: 127] contains only the constant 0.
PASS   k-rate offset k-rate output [128: 255] contains only the constant 2.5.
PASS   k-rate offset k-rate output [256: 383] contains only the constant 5.
