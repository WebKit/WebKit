PASS   Expected k-rate delayTime AudioParam with input is not constantly 0 (contains 4656 different values).
PASS   Actual k-rate delayTime AudioParam with input is not constantly 0 (contains 4656 different values).
PASS   output[128, 143] contains only the constant 0.
PASS   output[144, 255] is not constantly 0 (contains 111 different values).
PASS   k-rate delayTime AudioParam with input equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS < [delayTime] All assertions passed. (total 15 assertions)
