PASS > [Test k-rate DelayNode]
PASS   DelayNode: Setting delayTime.automationRate to "k-rate" is equal to k-rate.
PASS   DelayNode: k-rate node: delayTime.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception.
PASS   DelayNode: k-rate node: delayTime.linearRampToValueAtTime(0.5,1) did not throw an exception.
PASS   DelayNode: a-rate node:delayTime.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception.
PASS   DelayNode: a-rate node:delayTime.linearRampToValueAtTime(0.5,1) did not throw an exception.
PASS   DelayNode: Output of k-rate DelayNode is identical to the array [expected array].
PASS   DelayNode: Output of a-rate DelayNode is identical to the array [expected array].
PASS   DelayNode: Difference between a-rate and k-rate DelayNode is not constantly 0 (contains 7937 different values).
PASS < [Test k-rate DelayNode] All assertions passed. (total 8 assertions)
