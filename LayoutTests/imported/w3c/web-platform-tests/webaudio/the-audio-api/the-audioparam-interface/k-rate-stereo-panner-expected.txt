PASS > [Test k-rate StereoPannerNode]  
PASS   StereoPannerNode: Setting pan.automationRate to "k-rate" is equal to k-rate. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: k-rate node: pan.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: k-rate node: pan.linearRampToValueAtTime(0.5,1) did not throw an exception. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: a-rate node:pan.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: a-rate node:pan.linearRampToValueAtTime(0.5,1) did not throw an exception. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: Output of k-rate StereoPannerNode is identical to the array [expected array]. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: Output of a-rate StereoPannerNode is identical to the array [expected array]. 
PASS   StereoPannerNode: Difference between a-rate and k-rate StereoPannerNode is not constantly 0 (contains 7961 different values).
