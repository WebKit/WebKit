PASS > [constant source]  
PASS   Basic: ConstantSourceNode({offset: 0.5}) is identical to the array [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5...]. 
PASS < [constant source] All assertions passed. (total 1 assertions) 
PASS > [stop before start]  
PASS   ConstantSourceNode with stop before start must output silence contains only the constant 0. 
PASS < [stop before start] All assertions passed. (total 1 assertions) 
PASS > [stop equal to start]  
PASS   ConstantSourceNode with stop equal to start  must output silence contains only the constant 0. 
PASS < [stop equal to start] All assertions passed. (total 1 assertions) 
PASS > [start/stop]  
PASS   start/stop: ConstantSourceNode frames [0, 10) contains only the constant 0. 
PASS   start/stop: ConstantSourceNode frames [10, 300) contains only the constant 1. 
PASS   start/stop: ConstantSourceNode frames [300, 6000) contains only the constant 0. 
PASS < [start/stop] All assertions passed. (total 3 assertions) 
PASS > [basic automation]  
PASS   Automation: ConstantSourceNode.linearRamp(1, 0.5) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0,"relativeThreshold":7.161e-7}. 
PASS   Automation: ConstantSourceNode after ramp contains only the constant 1. 
PASS < [basic automation] All assertions passed. (total 2 assertions) 
PASS > [connected audioparam]  
PASS   Connected param: ConstantSourceNode frames [0, 10) contains only the constant 0. 
PASS   Connected param: ConstantSourceNode frames [10, 6000) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0,"relativeThreshold":0}.
