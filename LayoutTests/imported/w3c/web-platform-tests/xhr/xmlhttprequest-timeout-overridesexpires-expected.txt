Description

This test validates that the XHR2 timeout property behaves as expected in async cases in document (i.e. non-worker) context.


PASS Timeout test: timeout set to expiring value after load fires, original timeout at 5000, reset at 4000 to 1000
PASS Timeout test: timeout set to expired value before load fires, original timeout at 5000, reset at 2000 to 1100
PASS Timeout test: timeout set to non-expiring value after timeout fires, original timeout at 1000, reset at 2000 to 500
