NOTRUN Playback rate affects whether active phase boundary is inclusive.
NOTRUN Verify that (play -> pause -> play) doesn't change phase/progress.
NOTRUN Pause in before phase, scroll timeline into active phase, animation should remain in the before phase
NOTRUN Pause in before phase, set animation current time to be in active range, animation should become active. Scrolling should have no effect.
NOTRUN Make scroller inactive, then set current time to an in range time
NOTRUN Animation effect is still applied after pausing and making timeline inactive.
NOTRUN Make timeline inactive, force style update then pause the animation. No crashing indicates test success.
