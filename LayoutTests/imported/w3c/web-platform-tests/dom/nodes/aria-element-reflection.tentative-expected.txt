FAIL Setting the IDL attribute to an element which is not the first element in DOM order with its ID causes the content attribute to be an empty string assert_true: expected true got false
FAIL Setting an element reference that crosses into a shadow tree is disallowed, but setting one that is in a shadow inclusive ancestor is allowed. assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL aria-errormessage assert_equals: expected (string) "errorMessage" but got (object) null
FAIL aria-details assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL Deleting a reflected element should return null for the IDL attribute and cause the content attribute to become stale. assert_equals: expected (object) Element node <div role="option" id="contentAttrElement">Item 1</div> but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL Changing the ID of an element causes the content attribute to become out of sync. assert_equals: expected (object) Element node <div role="option" id="changingIdElement">Item 1</div> but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL Reparenting an element into a descendant shadow scope hides the element reference. assert_equals: null before expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL Reparenting referenced element cannot cause retargeting of reference. assert_equals: expected (string) "apple" but got (object) null
FAIL Element reference set in invalid scope remains intact throughout move to valid scope. assert_equals: expected null but got Element node <div id="toast"></div>
FAIL aria-labelledby. assert_array_equals: parsed content attribute sets element references. value is undefined, expected array

FAIL Moving explicitly set elements across shadow DOM boundaries. assert_equals: expected (string) "buttonDescription1 buttonDescription2" but got (object) null
FAIL Moving explicitly set elements around within the same scope, and removing from the DOM. assert_array_equals: aria-labeled by is supported by IDL getter. value is undefined, expected array
PASS Reparenting.
FAIL Attaching element reference before it's inserted into the DOM. assert_equals: Referenced element not inserted into document, so is in an invalid scope. expected null but got Element node <span id="toSpan"></span>
