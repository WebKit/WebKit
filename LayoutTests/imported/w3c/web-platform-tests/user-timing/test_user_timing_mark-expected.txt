CONSOLE MESSAGE: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: wp_test

Harness Error (FAIL), message = ReferenceError: Can't find variable: wp_test

Description

This test validates that the performance.mark() method is working properly. This test creates the following marks to test this method:

"mark1": created using a normal mark() call
"mark1": duplicate of the first mark, used to confirm names can be re-used
After creating each mark, the existence of these marks is validated by calling performance.getEntriesByName() (both with and without the entryType parameter provided), performance.getEntriesByType(), and performance.getEntries()
