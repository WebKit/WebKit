Pointer Event: releasePointerCapture() - subsequent events follow normal hitting testing mechanisms

Test Description: Use your pointer and press down in the black box. Then move around in the box and release your pointer. After invoking the releasePointerCapture method on an element, subsequent events for the specified pointer must follow normal hit testing mechanisms for determining the event target.



PASS mouse got/lost pointercapture: subsequent events to target
PASS mouse pointerover/enter should be received before the target receives gotpointercapture even when the pointer is not over it.
PASS mouse gotpointercapture.pointerType is correct.
PASS mouse gotpointercapture event is a PointerEvent event
PASS mouse gotpointercapture.fromElement value is null
PASS mouse gotpointercapture.toElement value is null
FAIL mouse gotpointercapture.isTrusted value is true assert_equals: expected true but got false
FAIL mouse gotpointercapture.composed value is valid assert_equals: expected true but got false
PASS mouse gotpointercapture.bubbles value is valid
PASS mouse gotpointercapture.cancelable value is valid
PASS mouse gotpointercapture.pressure value is valid
PASS mouse gotpointercapture properties for pointerType = mouse
PASS mouse lostpointercapture.pointerType is correct.
PASS mouse lostpointercapture event is a PointerEvent event
PASS mouse lostpointercapture.fromElement value is null
PASS mouse lostpointercapture.toElement value is null
FAIL mouse lostpointercapture.isTrusted value is true assert_equals: expected true but got false
FAIL mouse lostpointercapture.composed value is valid assert_equals: expected true but got false
PASS mouse lostpointercapture.bubbles value is valid
PASS mouse lostpointercapture.cancelable value is valid
PASS mouse lostpointercapture.pressure value is valid
PASS mouse lostpointercapture properties for pointerType = mouse
PASS mouse pointerout/leave should not be received unless the target just lost the capture.
