Pointer Event: releasePointerCapture() - subsequent events follow normal hitting testing mechanisms

Test Description: Use your pointer and press down in the black box. Then move around in the box and release your pointer. After invoking the releasePointerCapture method on an element, subsequent events for the specified pointer must follow normal hit testing mechanisms for determining the event target.



PASS pen got/lost pointercapture: subsequent events to target
PASS pen pointerover/enter should be received before the target receives gotpointercapture even when the pointer is not over it.
FAIL pen gotpointercapture.pointerType is correct. assert_equals: expected "pen" but got "mouse"
PASS pen gotpointercapture event is a PointerEvent event
PASS pen gotpointercapture.fromElement value is null

PASS pen pointerout/leave should not be received unless the target just lost the capture.
