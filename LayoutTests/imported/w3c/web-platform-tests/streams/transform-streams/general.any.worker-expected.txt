PASS TransformStream can be constructed with a transform function
PASS TransformStream can be constructed with no transform function
PASS TransformStream writable starts in the writable state
PASS Identity TransformStream: can read from readable what is put into writable
PASS Uppercaser sync TransformStream: can read from readable transformed version of what is put into writable
PASS Uppercaser-doubler sync TransformStream: can read both chunks put into the readable
PASS Uppercaser async TransformStream: can read from readable transformed version of what is put into writable
PASS Uppercaser-doubler async TransformStream: can read both chunks put into the readable
PASS TransformStream: by default, closing the writable closes the readable (when there are no queued writes)
PASS TransformStream: by default, closing the writable waits for transforms to finish before closing both
PASS TransformStream: by default, closing the writable closes the readable after sync enqueues and async done
PASS TransformStream: by default, closing the writable closes the readable after async enqueues and async done
PASS Transform stream should call transformer methods as methods
PASS methods should not not have .apply() or .call() called
PASS TransformStream start, transform, and flush should be strictly ordered
PASS it should be possible to call transform() synchronously
PASS closing the writable should close the readable when there are no queued chunks, even with backpressure
PASS enqueue() should throw after controller.terminate()
PASS enqueue() should throw after readable.cancel()
PASS controller.terminate() should do nothing the second time it is called
PASS terminate() should do nothing after readable.cancel()
PASS start() should not be called twice
PASS specifying a defined readableType should throw
PASS specifying a defined writableType should throw
FAIL Subclassing TransformStream should work assert_true: Subclass object should be an instance of Subclass expected true got false
