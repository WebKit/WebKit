PASS TransformStream errors thrown in transform put the writable and readable in an errored state 
PASS TransformStream errors thrown in flush put the writable and readable in an errored state 
PASS errored TransformStream should not enqueue new chunks 
PASS TransformStream transformer.start() rejected promise should error the stream 
PASS when controller.error is followed by a rejection, the error reason should come from controller.error 
PASS TransformStream constructor should throw when start does 
PASS when strategy.size throws inside start(), the constructor should throw the same error 
PASS when strategy.size calls controller.error() then throws, the constructor should throw the first error 
PASS cancelling the readable side should error the writable 
PASS it should be possible to error the readable between close requested and complete 
PASS an exception from transform() should error the stream if terminate has been requested but not completed 
PASS abort should set the close reason for the writable when it happens before cancel during start, but cancel should still succeed 
PASS abort should set the close reason for the writable when it happens before cancel during underlying sink write, but cancel should still succeed 
PASS controller.error() should do nothing the second time it is called 
PASS controller.error() should do nothing after readable.cancel() 
PASS controller.error() should do nothing after writable.abort() has completed 
PASS controller.error() should do nothing after a transformer method has thrown an exception 
PASS erroring during write with backpressure should result in the write failing 
PASS a write() that was waiting for backpressure should reject if the writable is aborted 
PASS the readable should be errored with the reason passed to the writable abort() method
