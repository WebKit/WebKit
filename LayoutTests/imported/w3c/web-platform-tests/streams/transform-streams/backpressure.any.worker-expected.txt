FAIL backpressure allows no transforms with a default identity transform and no reader assert_array_equals: transform should not be called lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got ["transform", "a"] length 2
PASS backpressure only allows one transform() with a identity transform with a readable HWM of 1 and no reader 
PASS transform() should keep being called as long as there is no backpressure 
PASS writes should resolve as soon as transform completes 
PASS calling pull() before the first write() with backpressure should work 
PASS transform() should be able to read the chunk it just enqueued 
PASS blocking transform() should cause backpressure 
PASS writer.closed should resolve after readable is canceled during start 
PASS writer.closed should resolve after readable is canceled with backpressure 
PASS writer.closed should resolve after readable is canceled with no backpressure 
PASS cancelling the readable should cause a pending write to resolve 
PASS cancelling the readable side of a TransformStream should abort an empty pipe 
PASS cancelling the readable side of a TransformStream should abort an empty pipe after startup 
PASS cancelling the readable side of a TransformStream should abort a full pipe
