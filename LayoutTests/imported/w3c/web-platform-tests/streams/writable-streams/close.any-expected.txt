Harness Error (FAIL), message = Unhandled rejection: error1

PASS fulfillment value of writer.close() call must be undefined even if the underlying sink returns a non-undefined value 
PASS when sink calls error asynchronously while sink close is in-flight, the stream should not become errored 
PASS when sink calls error synchronously while closing, the stream should not become errored 
PASS when the sink throws during close, and the close is requested while a write is still in-flight, the stream should become errored during the close 
PASS releaseLock on a stream with a pending write in which the stream has been errored 
PASS releaseLock on a stream with a pending close in which controller.error() was called 
PASS when close is called on a WritableStream in writable state, ready should return a fulfilled promise 
PASS when close is called on a WritableStream in waiting state, ready promise should be fulfilled 
PASS when close is called on a WritableStream in waiting state, ready should be fulfilled immediately even if close takes a long time 
PASS returning a thenable from close() should work 
PASS releaseLock() should not change the result of sync close() 
PASS releaseLock() should not change the result of async close() 
PASS close() should set state to CLOSED even if writer has detached 
PASS the promise returned by async abort during close should resolve 
PASS promises must fulfill/reject in the expected order on closure 
PASS promises must fulfill/reject in the expected order on aborted closure 
PASS promises must fulfill/reject in the expected order on aborted and errored closure 
PASS close() should not reject until no sink methods are in flight 
PASS ready promise should be initialised as fulfilled for a writer on a closed stream 
PASS close() on a writable stream should work 
PASS close() on a locked stream should reject 
PASS close() on an erroring stream should reject 
PASS close() on an errored stream should reject 
PASS close() on an closed stream should reject 
PASS close() on a stream with a pending close should reject
