PASS Can get the ReadableStreamDefaultReader constructor indirectly
PASS ReadableStreamDefaultReader constructor should get a ReadableStream object as argument
PASS ReadableStreamDefaultReader instances should have the correct list of properties
PASS ReadableStreamDefaultReader closed should always return the same promise object
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamDefaultReader directly should fail if the stream is already locked (via direct construction)
PASS Getting a ReadableStreamDefaultReader via getReader should fail if the stream is already locked (via direct construction)
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamDefaultReader directly should fail if the stream is already locked (via getReader)
PASS Getting a ReadableStreamDefaultReader via getReader should fail if the stream is already locked (via getReader)
PASS Constructing a ReadableStreamDefaultReader directly should be OK if the stream is closed

PASS Reading from a reader for an empty stream will wait until a chunk is available
PASS cancel() on a reader does not release the reader
PASS closed should be fulfilled after stream is closed (.closed access before acquiring)
PASS closed should be rejected after reader releases its lock (multiple stream locks)
