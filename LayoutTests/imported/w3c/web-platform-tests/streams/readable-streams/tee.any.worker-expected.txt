Harness Error (FAIL), message = Unhandled rejection

PASS ReadableStream teeing: rs.tee() returns an array of two ReadableStreams
PASS ReadableStream teeing: should be able to read one branch to the end without affecting the other
PASS ReadableStream teeing: values should be equal across each branch
PASS ReadableStream teeing: errors in the source should propagate to both branches
PASS ReadableStream teeing: canceling branch1 should not impact branch2
PASS ReadableStream teeing: canceling branch2 should not impact branch1
PASS ReadableStream teeing: canceling both branches should aggregate the cancel reasons into an array
PASS ReadableStream teeing: canceling both branches in reverse order should aggregate the cancel reasons into an array
PASS ReadableStream teeing: failing to cancel the original stream should cause cancel() to reject on branches
PASS ReadableStream teeing: erroring a teed stream should properly handle canceled branches
PASS ReadableStream teeing: erroring a teed stream should error both branches
PASS ReadableStream teeing: closing the original should immediately close the branches
PASS ReadableStream teeing: erroring the original should immediately error the branches
PASS ReadableStream teeing: canceling branch1 should finish when branch2 reads until end of stream
PASS ReadableStream teeing: canceling branch1 should finish when original stream errors
PASS ReadableStreamTee should not use a modified ReadableStream constructor from the global object
FAIL ReadableStreamTee should not pull more chunks than can fit in the branch queue assert_array_equals: pull should only be called once lengths differ, expected array ["pull"] length 1, got ["pull", "pull"] length 2
FAIL ReadableStreamTee should only pull enough to fill the emptiest queue assert_array_equals: pull should be called twice lengths differ, expected array ["pull", "pull"] length 2, got ["pull", "pull", "pull", "pull"] length 4
PASS ReadableStreamTee should not pull when original is already errored
FAIL ReadableStreamTee stops pulling when original stream errors while branch 1 is reading assert_array_equals: pull should be called once lengths differ, expected array ["pull"] length 1, got ["pull", "pull"] length 2
FAIL ReadableStreamTee stops pulling when original stream errors while branch 2 is reading assert_array_equals: pull should be called once lengths differ, expected array ["pull"] length 1, got ["pull", "pull"] length 2
FAIL ReadableStreamTee stops pulling when original stream errors while both branches are reading assert_array_equals: pull should be called once lengths differ, expected array ["pull"] length 1, got ["pull", "pull"] length 2
