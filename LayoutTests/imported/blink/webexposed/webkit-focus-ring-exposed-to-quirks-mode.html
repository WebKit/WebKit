<style>
    #focus_ring {
        color: -webkit-focus-ring-color;
    }
</style>

This test is parsed in quirks mode and should thus support
-webkit-focus-ring-color, both in style declarations and in
HTML attributes.

The below text should be differently colored than the default
text color, which is what this reftest tests.

<font id="focus_ring">Some text #1</font>
<font style="color: -webkit-focus-ring-color">Some text #2</font>
