<!DOCTYPE html>
This test is parsed in standards mode and should thus not support
-webkit-focus-ring-color, neither in style declarations or in HTML
attributes.

The below text should not be differently colored than the default
text color, which is what this reftest tests.

<font>Some text #1</font>
<font>Some text #2</font>
