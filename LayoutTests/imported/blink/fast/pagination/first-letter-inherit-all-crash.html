<p>overflow-y isn't a valid property for ::first-letter. We'd crash when extracting innerText,
    because the implementation expects that the first letter text is a direct child of the
    ::first-letter pseudo object. The paged overflow / multicol implementation would violate this
    assumption by inserting a flow thread object between the ::first-letter pseudo object and the
    actual text.</p>
<p>PASS if no crash or assertion failure.</p>
