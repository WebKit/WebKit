PASS if no crash.

After initial layout: A multicol has a column-span:all descendant (not a direct child, so that we establish block continuations and anonymous multi-column blocks)
Turn a child of this multicol container into a multicol
Add another column-span:all descendant (again, not a direct child, so that we get more continuations)
Set display:none on everything
