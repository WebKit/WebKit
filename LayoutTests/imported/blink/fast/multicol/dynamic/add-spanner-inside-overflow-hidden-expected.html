<p>Add a spanner inside a fixed-size clipped block inside a multicol container. It should not be
    affected by the clipping, since the containing block of a spanner is the multicol
    container. This also tests that we don't perform any optimized subtree layout operations
    incompatible with multicol (which would typically cause assertion failures).</p>
<p>You should see the word "PASS" below, and nothing else (no red, no "FAIL").</p>
<div style="line-height:2em;">

    PASS
