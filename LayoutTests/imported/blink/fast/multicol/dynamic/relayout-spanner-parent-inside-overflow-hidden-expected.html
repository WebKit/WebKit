<p>Change the width of the parent of a spanner when inside a fixed-size clipped block. The spanner
    should not be affected by this, since the parent isn't the containing block. This also tests
    that we don't perform any optimized subtree layout operations incompatible with multicol (which
    would typically cause assertion failures).</p>
<p>You should see the word "PASS" below, with large letter spacing.</p>
