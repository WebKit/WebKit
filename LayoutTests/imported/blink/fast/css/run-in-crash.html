<p>This tests a case where a particular DOM tree involving the run-in style
causes multiple continuations to be created in the render tree in a configuration where
the same render tree node would be destroyed twice. If there is no crash, the test passes.</p>

<span style="display: run-in">
    <span></span>
    <marquee>
        <span>
            <span>
                <div></div>
            </span>
        </span>
    </marquee>
</span>
<div></div>

<p>If you can see this the test almost certainly passed.</p>
