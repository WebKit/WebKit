<p>Tests distributed &lt;summary> elements are not recognized as children of &lt;details> elements.
<p>Note in the current build, &lt;details> cannot show toggle buttons if &lt;summary> elements are distributed.
    The expected file simulates this behavior.
<div id=host>
    <summary id=summary>Distributed summary</summary>
