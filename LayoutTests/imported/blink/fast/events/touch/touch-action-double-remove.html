<!--
This is a regression test against a double unregistration of a touch action
event handler on a <br> element. When the document finishes loading and is
attached to the view, all of its LayoutObjects are destroyed and recreated. If
a LayoutObject had a touch action associated with it, it will need to remove
the fake event handler it registered for it in the EventHandlerRegistry.
However, when the document gets detached, all of the event handlers within it
are automatically unregistered. When the LayoutObject tries to unregister its
own handler after the fact, it is no longer there and we hit an assertion
failure.

Note that this test doesn't use js-test.js because it also inadvertedly
triggers the same bug by appending <br> elements to the document.

The test passes if it doesn't trigger an assertion failure in a debug build.
