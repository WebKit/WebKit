Test that if a form is submitted from a document with a base element that sets a target,<br>
the form's target attribute takes precedence over the base's target attribute.<br>
This was regressed in http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink/?view=revision&revision=153933<br>
This test will timeout if it fails.<br>
