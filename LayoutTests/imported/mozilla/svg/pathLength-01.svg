  <!-- This path is really 400 units long (and its halfway point is at the
       right edge of our viewBox). We use pathLength to normalize its length
       to 20, though, so the first 10-unit-long dash in stroke-dasharray ends
       up covering 10/20 = 1/2 of the path. This covers the whole viewBox. -->
