Basic testing for AudioContext.baseLatency.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS context.sampleRate is expectedSampleRate
PASS context.baseLatency == (renderQuantum / expectedSampleRate) || context.baseLatency == (2 * (renderQuantum / expectedSampleRate)) is true
PASS context.sampleRate is expectedSampleRate
PASS context.baseLatency == (renderQuantum / expectedSampleRate) || context.baseLatency == (2 * (renderQuantum / expectedSampleRate)) is true
PASS context.sampleRate is expectedSampleRate
PASS context.baseLatency == (renderQuantum / expectedSampleRate) || context.baseLatency == (2 * (renderQuantum / expectedSampleRate)) is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
