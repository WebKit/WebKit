// Notes about generated waveforms:
//
// QUESTION: Why does the wave shape not look like the exact shape (sharp edges)?
// ANSWER: Because a shape with sharp edges has infinitely high frequency content.
// Since a digital audio signal must be band-limited based on the nyquist frequency (half the sample-rate)
// in order to avoid aliasing, this creates more rounded edges and "ringing" in the
// appearance of the waveform.  See Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem
//
// QUESTION: Why does the very end of the generated signal appear to get slightly weaker?
// ANSWER: This is an artifact of the algorithm to avoid aliasing.
