PASS > [basic test small] Start oscillator slightly past a sample frame 
PASS   Oscillator.start(1.25 frames) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.0001088,"relativeThreshold":0}. 
PASS   Oscillator.start(1.25 frames): SNR (dB) is greater than or equal to 84.054. 
PASS < [basic test small] All assertions passed. (total 2 assertions) 
PASS > [basic test big] Start oscillator slightly before a sample frame 
PASS   Oscillator.start(1.75 frames) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.00010844,"relativeThreshold":0}.
