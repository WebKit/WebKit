PASS > [basic test small] Start oscillator slightly past a sample frame
PASS   Oscillator.start(1.25 frames) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.000109,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS   Oscillator.start(1.25 frames): SNR (dB) is greater than or equal to 84.054.
PASS < [basic test small] All assertions passed. (total 2 assertions)
