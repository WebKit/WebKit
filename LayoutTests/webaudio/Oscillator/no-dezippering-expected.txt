PASS > [frequency] Test Oscillator frequency has no dezippering
PASS   Oscillator period in frames (128) is an integer is true.
PASS   Oscillator period in frames (128) is a multiple of 128 is true.
PASS   Part 0 (sine wave at 128 Hz) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":1.1921e-7,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS   Part 1 (sine wave at 440 Hz) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":1.7882e-7,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS < [frequency] All assertions passed. (total 4 assertions)
PASS > [detune] Test Oscillator detune has no dezippering
PASS   Oscillator period in frames (256) is an integer is true.
PASS   Oscillator period in frames (256) is a multiple of 128 is true.
PASS   Part 0 (sine wave at 64 Hz) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":1.1921e-7,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS   Part 1 (sine wave at 90.5096664428711 Hz) equals [expected array] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.0000036657,"relativeThreshold":0}.
