PASS: `c` should be 0 in `bar`.
PASS: `this` should be undefined in `bar`.
PASS: `a` should be 1 in `foo`.
PASS: `b` should be 2 in `foo`.
PASS: `c` should be 6 in `foo`.
PASS: `this` should be 'my-this-object' in `foo`.

-- Running test case: AccessCommandLineAPI

-- Running test case: CommandLineAPIDoesNotShadowGlobalVariables
PASS: CommandLineAPI `keys` can be accessed in the `bar` strict call frame.
PASS: Global assignment to `keys` should be okay.
PASS: Global variable `keys` should not be shadowed by CommandLineAPI `keys` function in call frame for `bar`.
PASS: CommandLineAPI `keys` can be accessed in the `bar` strict call frame after deleting global variable `keys`.
