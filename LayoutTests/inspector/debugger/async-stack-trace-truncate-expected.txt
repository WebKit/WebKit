Tests for truncating async stack traces that exceed the maximum async stack trace depth.


== Running test suite: AsyncStackTrace.Truncate
-- Running test setup.
Set maximum stack trace depth = 0.
-- Running test case: AsyncStackTrace.DisableAsyncStackTrace
PAUSED
CALL STACK:
0: [F] handleAnimationFrame
PASS: Async stack trace should be null.
-- Running test teardown.

-- Running test setup.
Set maximum stack trace depth = 10.
-- Running test case: AsyncStackTrace.CheckTruncated
