Test scrolling with page granularity by using the space bar excludes the height of fixed element covering the full page width. In this case, the cumulative size of both bars is larger than the threshold, and only 120px are removed from the 240px fixed height.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
