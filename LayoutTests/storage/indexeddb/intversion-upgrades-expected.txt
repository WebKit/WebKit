Upgrade a database, open a second connection at the same version, ensure specifying a lower version causes an error

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB = self.indexedDB || self.webkitIndexedDB || self.mozIndexedDB || self.msIndexedDB || self.OIndexedDB;

Call open with no version parameter:
indexedDB.open(dbname)

The next connection opens the database at the same version so connection2 shouldn't get a versionchange event.
