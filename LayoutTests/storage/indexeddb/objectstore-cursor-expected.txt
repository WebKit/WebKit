Test IndexedDB's objectStore.openCursor + the cursor it produces in depth.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB = self.indexedDB || self.webkitIndexedDB || self.mozIndexedDB || self.msIndexedDB || self.OIndexedDB;

indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)
indexedDB.open(dbname)
objectStore = db.createObjectStore('someObjectStore')

Verify that specifying an invalid direction raises an exception:
Expecting TypeError exception from objectStore.openCursor(0, 'invalid-direction')
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS objectStore.openCursor(0, 'invalid-direction') threw TypeError: Argument 2 ('direction') to IDBObjectStore.openCursor must be one of: "next", "nextunique", "prev", "prevunique"
