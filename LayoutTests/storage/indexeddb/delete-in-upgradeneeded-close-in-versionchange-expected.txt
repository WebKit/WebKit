Test that a deleteDatabase called while handling an upgradeneeded event is queued and fires its events at the right time. The close() call to unblock the delete occurs in the connection's 'versionchange' event handler.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB = self.indexedDB || self.webkitIndexedDB || self.mozIndexedDB || self.msIndexedDB || self.OIndexedDB;

dbname = "delete-in-upgradeneeded-close-in-versionchange.html"
indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)

initiallyDeleted():
request = indexedDB.open(dbname, 1)

upgradeNeededCallback():
PASS sawUpgradeNeeded is false
sawUpgradeNeeded = true
PASS event.oldVersion is 0
PASS event.newVersion is 1
db = event.target.result
deleteRequest = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)
request2.onsuccess = deleteSuccessCallback

versionChangeCallback():
PASS event.oldVersion is 1
PASS event.newVersion is null
sawVersionChange = true
Closing the connection before the IDBOpenDBRequest's success fires will cause the open to fail.
db.close()

deleteBlockedCallback():
PASS sawVersionChange is true
sawDeleteBlocked = true

deleteSuccessCallback():
PASS sawVersionChange is true
FIXME: Blocked events shouldn't fire if connections close in versionchange handler. http://wkbug.com/71130
FAIL sawDeleteBlocked should be false. Was true.
PASS sawUpgradeNeeded is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
