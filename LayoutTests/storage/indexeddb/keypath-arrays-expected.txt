Test IndexedDB Array-type keyPaths

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.INVALID_ACCESS_ERR
Exception message: Failed to execute 'createObjectStore' on 'IDBDatabase': The autoIncrement option was set but the keyPath option was empty or an array.
Expecting exception from store.createIndex('index-multientry', ['e', 'f'], {multiEntry: true})
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.INVALID_ACCESS_ERR
Exception message: Failed to execute 'createIndex' on 'IDBObjectStore': The keyPath argument was an array and the multiEntry option is true.

Empty arrays are not valid key paths:
Expecting exception from db.createObjectStore('store-keypath-empty-array', {keyPath: []})
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.SYNTAX_ERR
Exception message: Failed to execute 'createObjectStore' on 'IDBDatabase': The keyPath option is not a valid key path.
Expecting exception from store.createIndex('index-keypath-empty-array', [])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.SYNTAX_ERR
Exception message: Failed to execute 'createIndex' on 'IDBObjectStore': The keyPath argument contains an invalid key path.
