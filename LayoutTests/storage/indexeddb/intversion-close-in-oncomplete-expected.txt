Call db.close() in the complete handler for a version change transaction, before the success event associated with the open call fires

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB = self.indexedDB || self.webkitIndexedDB || self.mozIndexedDB || self.msIndexedDB || self.OIndexedDB;

dbname = "intversion-close-in-oncomplete.html"
indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)
request = indexedDB.open(dbname, 7)

upgradeNeeded():
db = event.target.result
PASS event.newVersion is 7
db.createObjectStore('os')
transaction = event.target.transaction

transaction.oncomplete:
sawTransactionComplete = true
db.close()
