Test the deleteDatabase call and its interaction with open/setVersion

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

NOTE: Will FAIL with extra bogus deleteDatabase().onblocked step; https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71130
FAIL self.steps.toString() should be h.open,h.open.onsuccess,deleteDatabase(),h.onversionchange,h.close,deleteDatabase().onsuccess. Was h.open,h.open.onsuccess,deleteDatabase(),h.onversionchange,h.close,deleteDatabase().onblocked,deleteDatabase().onsuccess.
