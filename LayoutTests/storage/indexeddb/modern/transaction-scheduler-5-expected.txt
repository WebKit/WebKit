This test creates two object stores. It then opens two long running read-only transactions, one per object store. It then opens a read-write transaction to both object stores. The read-only transactions both need to finish before the read-write transaction starts.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
