Makes sure transactions stop on navigation to a new page.<br>
If the previous page's transaction is blindly charging forward, this test will probably timeout.<br>
If the previous page's connection/transactions did not clean up properly, the delete request in this test will incorrectly be blocked.<br>
If every thing is peachy keen, the delete request in this test will correctly succeed.<br>
<div id="logger"></div>

function log(msg)
{
    document.getElementById("logger").innerHTML += msg + "<br>";

{
    log("Done.");
    if (window.testRunner)
        testRunner.notifyDone();
}

// Calling "deleteDatabase" while there are already open connections causes those connections to first receive a versionChange event.
// If the transaction/connection from the previous page is still active, then deleting the database will timeout because the previous connection will never be able to respond to the version change event.
// Deleting the database should immediately succeed.

var request = window.indexedDB.deleteDatabase('transactions-stop-on-navigation.html');
request.onsuccess = deleteSuccess;
request.onblocked = deleteBlocked;
