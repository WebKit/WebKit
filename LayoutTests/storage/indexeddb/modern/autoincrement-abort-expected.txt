This test creates a new database with an objectstore that autoincrements. It then puts some things in that object store, checking the keys that were used. But it then aborts that transaction. Then it opens a new one and puts something in it, double checking that the key generator was reverted when the above transaction was aborted.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
