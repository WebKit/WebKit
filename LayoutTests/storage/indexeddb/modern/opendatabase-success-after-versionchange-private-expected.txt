This test verifies that: - Opening a new database results in the onupgradeneeded handler being called on the IDBOpenDBRequest. - The versionchange transaction representing the upgrade commits successfully. - After that transaction commits, the onsuccess handler on the original IDBOpenDBRequest is called.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
