Verify that that cursors weakly hold request, and work if request is GC'd

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Create 1000 cursorRequests and check their results in otherRequestSuccess().
otherRequest = store.get(0)

otherRequestSuccess():
Verify that results of openCursor requests can be accessed lazily.
gc()
Ensure requests are not released if cursors are still around.
cursorRequests = null
gc()
PASS isAnyCollected(cursorRequestObservers) is false
Ensure requests are not released if they are pending.
cursors = null
gc()
PASS isAnyCollected(cursorObservers) is false
PASS isAnyCollected(cursorRequestObservers) is false
finalRequest = store.get(0)
Check result after transaction commits automatically after finishing requests.

onTransactionComplete():
Ensure requests and cursors are released after transaction commits.
PASS cursors is non-null.
PASS cursors.length is 1000
cursors = null
gc()
PASS isAnyCollected(cursorObservers) is true
PASS isAnyCollected(cursorRequestObservers) is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true
