Test that pending transactions are not completed during recursive JS calls until all JS is finished.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


indexedDB = self.indexedDB || self.webkitIndexedDB || self.mozIndexedDB || self.msIndexedDB || self.OIndexedDB;

indexedDB.deleteDatabase(dbname)
indexedDB.open(dbname)
pendingTransaction = db.transaction(['objectStore'], 'readwrite')
Start re-entrant JS
transaction = db.transaction(['objectStore'], 'readwrite')
End re-entrant JS
store = pendingTransaction.objectStore('objectStore')
PASS store !== undefined is true
PASS Pending transaction completed
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
