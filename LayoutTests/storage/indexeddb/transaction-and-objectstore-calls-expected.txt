Test IndexedDB's transaction and objectStore calls

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Passing a string as the first argument is a shortcut for just one object store:
trans = db.transaction('a')
trans.objectStore('a')
Expecting exception from trans.objectStore('b')
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from trans.objectStore('x')
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR

PASS trans = db.transaction() threw exception TypeError: Type error.

Expecting exception from db.transaction(['x'])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from db.transaction(['x'])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from db.transaction(['a', 'x'])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from db.transaction(['x', 'x'])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from db.transaction(['a', 'x', 'b'])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR

Exception thrown when no stores specified:
Expecting exception from db.transaction([])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is DOMException.INVALID_ACCESS_ERR

{} coerces to a string - so no match, but not a type error:
Expecting exception from db.transaction({})
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from db.transaction({mode:0})
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR

Overriding the default string coercion makes these work:
db.transaction({toString:function(){return 'a';}})
db.transaction([{toString:function(){return 'a';}}])
... but you still need to specify a real store:
Expecting exception from db.transaction([{toString:function(){return 'x';}}])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR
Expecting exception from db.transaction([{toString:function(){return 'x';}}])
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_FOUND_ERR

trans = db.transaction(['store'])
PASS trans != null is true
store = trans.objectStore('store')
PASS store != null is true
store.get('some_key')
transaction complete, ensuring methods fail
PASS trans != null is true
PASS store != null is true
Expecting exception from trans.objectStore('store')
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_ALLOWED_ERR
Expecting exception from store.index('index')
PASS Exception was thrown.
PASS code is webkitIDBDatabaseException.NOT_ALLOWED_ERR
PASS successfullyParsed is true
