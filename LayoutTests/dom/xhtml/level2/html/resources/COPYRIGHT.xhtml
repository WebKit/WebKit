      The DOM Conformance Test Suite for Level 2 html is published under
      the W3C Software Copyright Notice and License. The software
      license requires "Notice of any changes or modifications to the
      W3C files, including the date changes were made."  Consequently,
      modified versions of the DOM ECMAScript or Java tests must
      document that they do not conform to the DOM Conformance Test
      Suites; in the case of the Java language binding, the package
      names can no longer be in the 'org.w3c' package.
