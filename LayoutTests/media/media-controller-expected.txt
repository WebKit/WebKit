Test presence of MediaController constructor, controller, and mediaGroup attributes:
EXPECTED (typeof(MediaController) != 'undefined') OK
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK
EXPECTED (video.mediaGroup == '') OK

Test that the presence of a mediaGroup attribute creates a controller:
EXPECTED (video2.mediaGroup == 'group') OK
EXPECTED (video2.controller != 'null') OK

Test that setting mediaGroup to an empty string removes the controller:
RUN(video.mediaGroup = '')
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK

Test manually creating and assigning a controller to a media element:
RUN(controller = new MediaController())
RUN(video.controller = controller)
EXPECTED (video.controller == '[object MediaController]') OK

Test that two media elements with the same mediaGroup have the same controller:
RUN(video.mediaGroup = 'group')
RUN(video2.mediaGroup = 'group')
EXPECTED (video.controller === video2.controller == 'true') OK
END OF TEST
