This test checks that setting an embedded text track as selected via the HTMLMediaElement JS APIs will correctly show this track as selected, and that selecting the "Automatic (Recommended)" track will revert back to selecting that entry.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
