Test that fastSeek() commands work correctly.

EVENT(canplaythrough)
Seek past the 4th sync sample:
RUN(video.currentTime = 2.5)
EVENT(timeupdate)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime.toFixed(1) == '2.5') OK
Test that fastSeek() past the currentTime will not result in a seek before the currentTime or past the seek time:
RUN(video.fastSeek(2.6))
EVENT(timeupdate)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime <= '2.6') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime >= '2.5') OK
Seek before the 4th sync sample:
RUN(video.currentTime = 2.3)
EVENT(timeupdate)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime.toFixed(1) == '2.3') OK
Test that fastSeek() before the currentTime will not result in a seek past the seek time:
RUN(video.fastSeek(2.2))
EVENT(timeupdate)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime <= '2.2') OK
END OF TEST
