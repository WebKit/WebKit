Test that setting currentTime immediately after fastSeek() works correctly.

EVENT(canplaythrough)

Seek to a specific time:
RUN(video.currentTime = 2.5)
EVENT(seeked)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '2.5') OK

Set currentTime shortly after calling fastSeek():
RUN(video.fastSeek(4.6))
RUN(setTimeout(function() { video.currentTime = 2.5; }, 10))

EVENT(seeked)
EVENT(seeked)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '2.5') OK

END OF TEST
