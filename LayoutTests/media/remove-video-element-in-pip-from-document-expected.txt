RUN(internals.setMockVideoPresentationModeEnabled(true))
EVENT(canplaythrough)
EVENT(enterpictureinpicture)
EXPECTED (window.internals.mediaPlayerRenderingCanBeAccelerated(video) == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (pipWindow.width > '0') OK
EXPECTED (pipWindow.height > '0') OK
The video element has been removed from DOM.
