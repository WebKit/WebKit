Test that seeking attribute is true immediately after a seek, goes back to false when seeking completes, and that a 'seeked' event is fired for each seek

EVENT(canplaythrough)
RUN(video.currentTime = 0.5)

EVENT(seeked)

EXPECTED (seekedCount == '1') OK
EXPECTED (video.seeking == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '0.5') OK
RUN(video.currentTime = 1)
EXPECTED (video.seeking == 'true') OK

EVENT(seeked)

EXPECTED (seekedCount == '2') OK
EXPECTED (video.seeking == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '1') OK
RUN(video.currentTime = 1.5)
EXPECTED (video.seeking == 'true') OK

EVENT(seeked)

EXPECTED (seekedCount == '3') OK
EXPECTED (video.seeking == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '1.5') OK
RUN(video.currentTime = 2)
EXPECTED (video.seeking == 'true') OK

END OF TEST
