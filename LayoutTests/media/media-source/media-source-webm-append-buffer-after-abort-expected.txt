This tests the ability of the SourceBuffer to reset the parser after an abort(). A SourceBuffer in this state should be able to accept a new initialization segment and a new media segment, and the video element should fire "canplaythrough" event.

RUN(video.src = URL.createObjectURL(source))
EVENT(sourceopen)
RUN(source.duration = loader.duration())
RUN(sourceBuffer = source.addSourceBuffer(loader.type()))
RUN(sourceBuffer.abort())
RUN(sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(loader.initSegment()))
EVENT(update)
EXPECTED (video.readyState == '1') OK
Append a media segment.
RUN(sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(loader.mediaSegment(0)))
EVENT(update)
EVENT(loadeddata)
EVENT(canplay)
EXPECTED (video.readyState == '3') OK
EXPECTED (sourceBuffer.buffered.length == '1') OK
EXPECTED (sourceBuffer.buffered.end(0) >= '1.9') OK
RUN(source.endOfStream())
EVENT(sourceended)
EVENT(canplaythrough)
EXPECTED (video.readyState == '4') OK
END OF TEST
