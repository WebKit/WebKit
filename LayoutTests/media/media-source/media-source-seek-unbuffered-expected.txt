This tests that when seeking and play into unbuffered time, currentTime doesn't appear to go backward.

RUN(video.src = URL.createObjectURL(source))
EVENT(sourceopen)
RUN(source.duration = loader.duration())
RUN(sourceBuffer = source.addSourceBuffer(loader.type()))
RUN(sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(loader.initSegment()))
EVENT(update)
Seek and append a media segment.
RUN(video.currentTime = 0.8)
RUN(sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(loader.mediaSegment(0)))
EVENT(seeked)
RUN(sourceBuffer.remove(0.5, 1))
EXPECTED (true == 'true') OK
END OF TEST
