Tests that cues are not affected by multiple newlines \n, \r, and \r\n and that cues that are not separated by whitespace are handled properly.

Note that cues not separated by whitespace will merge portions of the following cue (e.g., the '2' from the unseparated cue in the second track becomes part of the prior cue.)
