When changing the source for a video, we shouldn't get duplicate in-band tracks.

EVENT(canplaythrough)

** Storing number of tracks and reloading video
EXPECTED (video.textTracks.length > '0') OK
RUN(numTracks = video.textTracks.length)
EVENT(canplaythrough)

** Loaded video again, checking if tracks number is the same
EXPECTED (video.textTracks.length == 'numTracks') OK
END OF TEST
