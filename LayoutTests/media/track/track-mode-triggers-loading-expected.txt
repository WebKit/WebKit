Tests that a 'metadata' track does not load automatically, but does load when the mode is changed.


EVENT(load) -- <body>
**check initial metadata track state
EXPECTED (track.readyState == '0') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[0].mode == 'disabled') OK

EVENT(canplaythrough) -- <video>
**change metadata track mode so it loads
EXPECTED (track.readyState == '0') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[0].mode == 'disabled') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[0].cues == 'null') OK
RUN(video.textTracks[0].mode = 'hidden')

EVENT(load) -- <track>
**check metadata track state
EXPECTED (track.readyState == '2') OK
EXPECTED (track.track.mode == 'hidden') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[0].cues.length == '12') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[0].cues[11].startTime == '22') OK

END OF TEST
