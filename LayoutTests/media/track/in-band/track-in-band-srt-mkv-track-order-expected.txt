Test track order when using in-band and out-of-band text tracks.

EVENT(addtrack)
EXPECTED (event.track == 'video.textTracks[0]') OK

EVENT(addtrack)
EXPECTED (event.track == 'video.textTracks[1]') OK

EVENT(canplaythrough)

** Check initial in-band track states
EXPECTED (video.textTracks.length == '2') OK
RUN(inbandTrack1 = video.textTracks[0])
RUN(inbandTrack2 = video.textTracks[1])

** Add two tracks, check sort order
RUN(addTrack = video.addTextTrack('captions', 'Caption Track', 'en'))
RUN(trackElement = document.createElement('track'))
RUN(video.appendChild(trackElement))
EXPECTED (video.textTracks.length == '4') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[0] == 'trackElement.track') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[1] == 'addTrack') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[2] == 'inbandTrack1') OK
EXPECTED (video.textTracks[3] == 'inbandTrack2') OK

** Unload video file, check track count
RUN(video.src = '')
EXPECTED (video.textTracks.length == '2') OK
