Test to ensure that a cue with an endtime equal to the current time is not active.

RUN(textTrack = video.addTextTrack('subtitles'))
RUN(textTrack.addCue(new VTTCue(1, 2, 'This should be gone by 2s.')))
RUN(shouldBeActiveCue = new VTTCue(2, 3, 'This should appear alone at 2s.'))
RUN(textTrack.addCue(shouldBeActiveCue))

EVENT(canplaythrough)
RUN(video.currentTime = 2)

EVENT(seeked)
EXPECTED (activeCues.length == '1') OK
EXPECTED (shouldBeActiveCue == '[object VTTCue]') OK

END OF TEST
