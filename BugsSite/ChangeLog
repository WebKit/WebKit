        [reviewtool] Add a field for overall comments
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45273

        This patch does a couple logically separate things that could be
        separated into smaller patches:

        1) This patch adds an "overall comments" field where you can enter
           overall comments about the patch.  These comments appear at the top
           of the bugzilla posting.  Currently, these aren't redisplayed when
           viewing the patch, but I plan to add that in a future patch.

        2) This patch renames some of the CSS classes to more consistently
           follow the camelCase style that PrettyPatch uses.

        3) This patch moves the "prepare comments" button to the left of the
           toolbar and renames is to "publish comments".  This makes more sense
           when you scroll to the bottom of the page and enter in some overall
           comments.

        4) When you attempt to add a comment to a line that already has a
           "frozen" comment, we now unfreeze the comment instead of doing
           nothing.  The old behavior was kind of frustrating if you didn't
           know that you could unfreeze a comment by clicking on it.

        [reviewtool] Add an "ok" button that collapses review comments
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45255

        Many folks (including myself) are too trigger-happy with the "delete"
        button that we end up deleting perfectly good review comments.  This
        patch adds an "ok" button to absorb these clicks (and renames "delete"
        to "cancel").  When you click the ok button, the comment becomes
        non-editable and the box shrinks to fit the text.  You can click the
        text to get back to the editable version.

        This patch adds basic support for showing previous comments inline in

        and extract comments related to specific lines.  We then show the

        focus.  Otherwise, fall back to the original behavior of
        focusing the first input field.

        Combine :equal operations with the following operation if they are
        fewer than 3 characters long

        This keeps us from showing lots of small changes on long lines, just
        because some letters happened to be the same.

        Inspired by
        http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/source/browse/trunk/reviewboard/diffviewer/diffutils.py?r=1264#147

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Remove :equal operations fewer
        than 3 characters long. The characters from the removed operations
        become part of the subsequent operation.
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Don't wrap 0-length strings in
        <ins>/<del> tags. Also removed the @fromLineNumber.nil? and
        @toLineNumber.nil? checks as they are no longer reliable now that
        we're removing operations.

        Change PrettyPatch to use DiffBuilder for intra-line diffs

        This gives us much prettier intra-line diffs, largely because it can
        distinguish multiple changes on the same line. e.g., if a line changes
        from:

        const int myConstant = 0;

        to

        static const unsigned myConstant;

        You will see that "static " was inserted, "int" changed to "unsigned",
        and " = 0" was deleted.

        This seems to have also gotten rid of some spurious instances of
        "<ins></ins>" and "<del></del>" at the end of a line.

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Use DiffBuilder instead of
        setChangeExtentFromLine (which had been copied from Trac's diffing
        code).
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine):
         - Removed the changeExtent attribute
         - Added the operations attribute
         - Removed the setChangeExtentFromLine method
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Uses @operations to determine
        what text to wrap in <ins> and <del> tags.
        * PrettyPatch/diff.rb: Deleted a bunch of code we don't use.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.initialize): Moved code here from the old build
        method, but left out the calls to perform_operation, since we build
        the diff HTML outside of this class.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.split_inputs_to_words): Removed calls to
        convert_html_to_list_of_words, since we're not diffing HTML.
