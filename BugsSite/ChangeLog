        Combine :equal operations with the following operation if they are
        fewer than 3 characters long

        This keeps us from showing lots of small changes on long lines, just
        because some letters happened to be the same.

        Inspired by
        http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/source/browse/trunk/reviewboard/diffviewer/diffutils.py?r=1264#147

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Remove :equal operations fewer
        than 3 characters long. The characters from the removed operations
        become part of the subsequent operation.
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Don't wrap 0-length strings in
        <ins>/<del> tags. Also removed the @fromLineNumber.nil? and
        @toLineNumber.nil? checks as they are no longer reliable now that
        we're removing operations.

2008-04-08  Adam Roben  <aroben@apple.com>

        Change PrettyPatch to use DiffBuilder for intra-line diffs

        This gives us much prettier intra-line diffs, largely because it can
        distinguish multiple changes on the same line. e.g., if a line changes
        from:

        const int myConstant = 0;

        to

        static const unsigned myConstant;

        You will see that "static " was inserted, "int" changed to "unsigned",
        and " = 0" was deleted.

        This seems to have also gotten rid of some spurious instances of
        "<ins></ins>" and "<del></del>" at the end of a line.

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Use DiffBuilder instead of
        setChangeExtentFromLine (which had been copied from Trac's diffing
        code).
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine):
         - Removed the changeExtent attribute
         - Added the operations attribute
         - Removed the setChangeExtentFromLine method
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Uses @operations to determine
        what text to wrap in <ins> and <del> tags.
        * PrettyPatch/diff.rb: Deleted a bunch of code we don't use.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.initialize): Moved code here from the old build
        method, but left out the calls to perform_operation, since we build
        the diff HTML outside of this class.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.split_inputs_to_words): Removed calls to
        convert_html_to_list_of_words, since we're not diffing HTML.
