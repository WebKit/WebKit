<p>
  <b>Name</b> is what is used with the UserInGroup() function in any
customized cgi files you write that use a given group.  It can also be used
by people submitting [% terms.bugs %] by email to limit [% terms.abug %]
to a certain set of groups.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Description</b> is what will be shown in the [% terms.bug %] reports
to members of the group where they can choose whether the [% terms.bug %]
will be restricted to others in the same group.
</p>

<p>
  <b>User RegExp</b> is optional, and if filled in, will automatically
grant membership to this group to anyone with an email address
that matches this perl regular expression. Do not forget
the trailing '$'.  Example '@mycompany\.com$'
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Use For [% terms.Bugs %]</b> flag determines whether or not
the group is eligible to be used for [% terms.bugs %]. If you remove
this flag, it will no longer be possible for users to add [% terms.bugs %]
to this group, although [% terms.bugs %] already in the group will remain
in the group. Doing so is a much less drastic way to stop a group
from growing than deleting the group as well as a way to maintain
lists of users without cluttering the lists of groups used
for [% terms.bug %] restrictions.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Type</b> field identifies system groups.
