>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
    under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
    In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="A"
><LI
><P
>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
        distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
        versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
        section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
        version if the original publisher of that version gives
        permission.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
        entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
        Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
        authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less
        than five).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
        adjacent to the other copyright notices.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
        notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under
        the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum
        below.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
        Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
        notice.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
        there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
        Version as stated in the previous sentence.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
        for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it
        was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may
        omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
        years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
        version it refers to gives permission.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
        preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
        dedications given therein.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
        in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
        are not considered part of the section titles.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may
        not be included in the Modified Version.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
        conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
    these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
    Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.</P
><P
>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
    example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
    an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
    and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
    list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
    arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
    cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
    made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
    another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
    previous publisher that added the old one.</P
><P
>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
    License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert
    or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</P
