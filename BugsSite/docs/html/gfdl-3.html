>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
    100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
    enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
    Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
    on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
    as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
    title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
    add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
    and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
    Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
    complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which
    the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
    at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
    (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
    public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.</P
