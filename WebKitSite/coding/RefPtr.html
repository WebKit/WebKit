<h2>History</h2>

<p>Many objects in WebKit are reference counted. The pattern used is that classes have
member functions <span class="function">ref</span> and <span class="function">deref</span>
that increment and decrement the reference count. Each call to <span class="function">ref</span>
has to be matched by a call to <span class="function">deref</span>. When the reference count hits 0,
the object is deleted. Many of these classes create new objects with a reference count of 0; this
is referred to as the floating state. An object in floating state must have <span class="function">ref</span> and then
<span class="function">deref</span> called on it before it will be deleted. Many classes in WebCore implement this by
inheriting from the <span class="class">Shared</span> class template.</p>

<p>Back in 2005, we discovered that there were many memory leaks, especially in WebCore
editor code, caused either by mismatches of <span class="function">ref</span> and
<span class="function">deref</span> calls or by objects that were created with new
that never got a <span class="function">ref</span> call at all that remained in the floating state.</p>

<p>We decided that we’d like
to use smart pointers to mitigate the problem. However, some early experiments showed that
smart pointers led to additional manipulation of reference counts that hurt performance.
For example, if a function took a smart pointer as a parameter and returned that same smart
pointer as a return value, just passing the parameter and returning the value would increment
and then decrement the reference count two to four times
as the object moved from one smart pointer to another. So we looked for an
idiom that would let us use smart pointers and avoid this reference count churn.</p>

<p>The inspiration for a solution came from the C++ standard class template <span class="class">std::auto_ptr</span>.
These objects implement a model where assignment is transfer of ownership. When you assign
from one <span class="class">auto_ptr</span> to another, the donor becomes 0.</p>

<p>Maciej Stachowiak devised a pair of class templates, <span class="class">RefPtr</span>
and <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>, that implement this scheme
for WebCore’s intrusive reference counting.</p>

<h2>Raw pointers</h2>

<p>When discussing smart pointers such as the <span class="class">RefPtr</span>
class template we use the term raw pointer to refer to the C++ language’s built in pointer type.
Here’s the canonical setter function, written with raw pointers:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// example, not preferred style</span>

class Document {
    <span class="comment">[...]</span>
    Title* m_title;
}

Document::Document()
    : m_title(0)
{
}

Document::~Document()
{
    if (m_title)
        m_title-&gt;deref();
}

void Document::setTitle(Title* t)
{
    if (t)
        t-&gt;ref();
    if (m_title)
        m_title-&gt;deref();
    m_title = t;
}</pre>

<h2><span class="class">RefPtr</span></h2>

<p><span class="class">RefPtr</span> is a simple smart pointer class that calls <span class="function">ref</span>
on incoming values and
<span class="function">deref</span> on outgoing values.
<span class="class">RefPtr</span> works on any object with both a <span class="function">ref</span> and
a <span class="function">deref</span> member function.
Here’s the setter function example, written with <span class="class">RefPtr</span>:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// example, not preferred style</span>
 
class Document {
    <span class="comment">[...]</span>
    RefPtr&lt;Title&gt; m_title;
}

void Document::setTitle(Title* t)
{
    m_title = t;
}</pre>

<p>Use of <span class="class">RefPtr</span> alone can lead to reference count churn.</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// example, not preferred style</span>
 
RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; createSpecialNode()
{
    RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; a = new Node;
    a-&gt;setSpecial(true);
    return a;
}

RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; b = createSpecialNode();</pre>

<p>The node object starts with a reference count of 0. When it’s assigned to <span class="variable">a</span>,
the reference count is incremented to 1. The reference count is incremented to 2 to
create the return value, then decremented back to 1 when <span class="variable">a</span> is destroyed.
Then the reference count is incremented to 2 to create <span class="variable">b</span>, and then decremented back
to 1 when the return value of <span class="function">createSpecialNode</span> is destroyed.</p>

<p>(This analysis ignores the possibility that the compiler might implement the
<a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=25033&amp;seqNum=3&amp;rl=1">return value optimization</a>.
If the compiler does, some of the reference count churn may be mitigated.)</p>

<p>The overhead of reference count churn is even greater when both function arguments and return
values are involved. The solution is <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="class">PassRefPtr</span></h2>

<p><span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> is like <span class="class">RefPtr</span> with a difference.
When you copy a <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> or
assign the value of a <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> to a <span class="class">RefPtr</span> or
another <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>, the original
pointer value is set to 0; the operation is done without any change to the reference count.
Let’s take a look at a new version of our example:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// example, not preferred style</span>

PassRefPtr&lt;Node&gt; createSpecialNode()
{
    PassRefPtr&lt;Node&gt; a = new Node;
    a-&gt;setSpecial(true);
    return a;
}

RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; b = createSpecialNode();</pre>

<p>The node object starts with a reference count of 0. When it’s assigned to <span class="variable">a</span>,
the reference count is incremented to 1. Then <span class="variable">a</span> gets set to 0 when the return
value <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> is created. Then the return value is set to 0 when
<span class="variable">b</span> is created.</p>

<p>However, as the Safari team learned when we started programming with <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>,
the rule that a pointer becomes 0 when it’s assigned to another variable can easily lead to mistakes.</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// example, not preferred style</span>
 
static RefPtr&lt;Ring&gt; g_oneRingToRuleThemAll;

void finish(PassRefPtr&lt;Ring&gt; ring)
{
    g_oneRingToRuleThemAll = ring;
    <span class="comment">...</span>
    ring-&gt;wear();
}</pre>

<p>By the time <span class="function">wear</span> is called, <span class="variable">ring</span>
is already 0. To avoid this, we recommend <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> only for
function argument and result types, copying arguments into <span class="class">RefPtr</span>
local variables.</p>

<pre class="code">static RefPtr&lt;Ring&gt; g_oneRingToRuleThemAll;

void finish(PassRefPtr&lt;Ring&gt; prpRing)
{
    RefPtr&lt;Ring&gt; ring = prpRing;
    g_oneRingToRuleThemAll = ring;
    <span class="comment">...</span>
    ring-&gt;wear();
}</pre>

<h2>Mixing <span class="class">RefPtr</span> and <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span></h2>

<p>Since we recommend use of <span class="class">RefPtr</span> in all cases except when passing arguments to or
returning values from a function, there will be times when you have a <span class="class">RefPtr</span>
and wish to transfer ownership as <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> does.
<span class="class">RefPtr</span> has a member function named
<span class="function">release</span> which does the trick. It sets the value of the original
<span class="class">RefPtr</span> to 0 and constructs a <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>, without
changing reference counts.</p>

<pre class="code">PassRefPtr&lt;Node&gt; createSpecialNode()
{
    RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; a = new Node;
    a-&gt;setCreated(true);
    return a.release();
}

RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; b = createSpecialNode();</pre>

<p>This keeps the efficiency of <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> while reducing the chance
that its relatively tricky semantics will cause problems.</p>

<h2>Mixing with raw pointers</h2>

<p>When using a <span class="class">RefPtr</span> to call a function that takes a raw pointer,
use <span class="function">get</span>.</p>

<pre class="code">printNode(stderr, a.get());</pre>

<p>However, there are operations that can be done on a <span class="class">RefPtr</span>
or <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> directly, without resorting to an explicit <span class="function">get</span> call.</p>

<pre class="code">RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; a = createSpecialNode();
Node* b = getOrdinaryNode();

<span class="comment">// the * operator</span>
*a = value;

<span class="comment">// the -&gt; operator</span>
a-&gt;clear();

<span class="comment">// null check in an if statement</span>
if (a)
    log("not empty");

<span class="comment">// the ! operator</span>
if (!a)
    log("empty");

<span class="comment">// the == and != operators, mixing with raw pointers</span>
if (a == b)
    log("equal");
if (a != b)
    log("not equal");

<span class="comment">// some type casts</span>
RefPtr&lt;DerivedNode&gt; d = static_pointer_cast&lt;DerivedNode&gt;(a);</pre>

<p>Normally, <span class="class">RefPtr</span> and <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>
enforce a simple rule; they always balance <span class="function">ref</span> and
<span class="function">deref</span> calls, guaranteeing a programmer can’t miss a
<span class="function">deref</span>. But in the case where we have a raw pointer,
already have a reference count, and want to transfer ownership the
<span class="function">adoptRef</span> function should be used.</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// warning, requires a pointer that already has a ref</span>
RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; node = adoptRef(rawNodePointer);</pre>

<p>To transfer from a <span class="class">RefPtr</span> to a raw pointer without
changing the reference count, <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> provides the
<span class="function">releaseRef</span> function.</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// warning, results in a pointer that must get an explicit deref</span>
RefPtr&lt;Node&gt; node = createSpecialNode();
Node* rawNodePointer = node.release().releaseRef();</pre>

<p>Since <span class="function">releaseRef</span> is rarely used, it’s provided only in the
<span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> class, hence the need to call <span class="function">release</span>,
then <span class="function">releaseRef</span>. If we find this is used often we could
provide <span class="function">releaseRef</span> for <span class="class">RefPtr</span> too.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>We’ve developed these guidelines for use of <span class="class">RefPtr</span>
and <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span> in WebKit code.</p>

<h3>Local variables</h3>
<ul>
<li>If ownership and lifetime are guaranteed, a local variable can be a raw pointer.</li>
<li>If the code needs to hold ownership or guarantee lifetime, a local variable should
be a <span class="class">RefPtr</span>.</li>
<li>Local variables should never be <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data members</h3>
<ul>
<li>If ownership and lifetime are guaranteed, a data member can be a raw pointer.</li>
<li>If the class needs to hold ownership or guarantee lifetime, the data member should
be a <span class="class">RefPtr</span>.</li>
<li>Data members should never be <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Function arguments</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a function does not take ownership of an object, the argument should be a raw pointer.</li>
<li>If a function does take ownership of an object, the argument should be a <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.
This includes most setter functions.
Unless the use of the argument is very simple, the argument should be transferred to a
<span class="class">RefPtr</span> at the start of the function; the argument can be named with
a “prp” prefix in such cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Function results</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a function’s result is an object, but ownership is not being transferred, the result
should be a raw pointer. This includes most getter functions.</li>
<li>If a function’s result is a new object or ownership is being transferred for any other
reason, the result should be a <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.
Since local variables are typically <span class="class">RefPtr</span>, it’s common to call
<span class="function">release</span> in the return statement to transfer the
<span class="class">RefPtr</span> to the <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>New objects should be put into a <span class="class">RefPtr</span> as soon as possible
after creation to avoid possibly leaking an object while it’s in a floating state.</li>
<li>Best idiom is to use a private constructor and have a public factory function that
returns a <span class="class">PassRefPtr</span>.</li>
</ul>
