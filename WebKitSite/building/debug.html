<h2>Debugging on Mac OS X</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Open a project</p>
<p>Each WebKit component -- JavaScriptCore, WebCore, and WebKit -- contains its own Xcode project. Open the project belonging to the component you want to debug.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set the project's build products location</p>
<p>To find the WebKit you built, Xcode needs to know the build products location that <tt>build-webkit</tt> used. You can set the build products location from the project's Info window.</p>
<img src="info-tab.png">
</li>
<li><p>Set the project's active build configuration</p>
<p>Xcode also needs to know the build configuration you used. You can set the active build configuration from the project's Build window.</p>
<img src="build-window.png">
</li>
<li><p>Add a custom executable to the project</p>
<p>Choose any WebKit application you want to use for debugging. To use Safari, select /Applications/Safari.app.</p>
<img src="custom-executable.png">
</li>
<li><p>Set the project's active executable</p>
<p>You can set the active executable from the project's Build window. Choose the executable you just added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Close and re-open the project</p>
<p>This will force Xcode to discover generated source files, which output to your build products location, allowing you to set breakpoints in them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launch the debugger</p>
<p>In the Debugger window, click the "Debug" button.</p>

<h2>Debugging on Windows</h2>
<p>
You can launch the Visual Studio development environment with the following
command:</p>
<p class="code">devenv /debugexe Safari.exe [args to safari]</p>
<p>The arguments to Safari should be the same ones that <tt>run-safari</tt> uses,
namely the <tt>/frameworkPath</tt> switch (to point to the path at which the updated
WebKit can be found) and <tt>debug</tt> if the WebKit you built is a debug version.</p>
