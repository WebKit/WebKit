        Fix JSON generations on new flakiness dashboard
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123723

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Add is_flaky column on results table so that this column can be used to find flaky tests on a given builder
        efficiently without having to through results for all tests in PHP. This column is updated in report.php
        when a new build is added. Because is_flaky depends on the preceding and succeeding results, we must update
        is_flaky flag on results for builds immediately before and after the new build as well.

        To see why, suppose we had two consecutive results [PASS] [PASS]. If we were to insert [FAIL] result between
        the two, those two results may also turn into flaky results if they were surrounded by [FAIL]. Similarly,
        if we had [PASS] [FAIL] and the second result was marked flaky, inserting new [FAIL] must unmark it.


        * init-database.sql: Added is_flaky column to results table with an index. Also added an index on
        build_revisions.time as many queries filter results by this quantity. Also set the work_mem to 50MB avoid
        disk thrashing while sorting results in various queries.

        * public/api/failing-tests.php: Handle builder ids as well as names. Call generate() with failure types.
        No longer generates *-failing.json since it's a subset of *-wrongexpectations.json to save time.

        * public/api/report.php: Rewritten. Calls update_flakiness_after_inserting_build to update is_flaky flags
        on the newly added results.
        (store_results): Added.
        (main): Added.

        * public/include/test-results.php:
        (ResultsJSONWriter):
        (ResultsJSONWriter::add_results_for_test): Renamed from add_results_for_test_if_matches.
        (ResultsJSONGenerator::generate): Takes the failure type. Instead of generating JSONs for all failure types
        at once, generate one JSON for the specified type. We generate the list of test ids based on the failure type
        and query results based on that. This dramatically cuts down the time spent in PHP.
        (ResultsJSONGenerator::latest_build): Added.

        * include/config.json: Specify the default cache time to be 10 minutes.
        * include/json-shared.php: Added Expires and Cache-Control headers. It's configurable via config.json.
        * index.html:
        (TestResultsView._createResultCell): Don't put '-' in a result cell without time.
        (TestResultsView._populateTestPane): Create an array of build times ordered from the newest to the oldest.
        Not that build.time() is the newest commit time among all repository for each result. e.g. if we had
        both WebKit and Safari repository information in a given result, the newer of the two will be used.
        (TestResultsView._createTestResultHeader): Added.
        (TestResultsView._createBuildsAndComputeSlownessOfResults): Extracted from _createTestResultRow so
        that _populateTestPane could use Build object before calling _createTestResultRow.
        (TestResultsView._createTestResultRow): Takes buildTimes. Insert an empty cell for a build time if
        the current row doesn't contain that a result for that build time.
        (TestResultsView._populateBuilderPane):
        * main.css: Tweaked the style so that bubbles are aligned vertically without '-'.

        * api/failing-tests.php: Manually serialize each row in the results to avoid hitting the memory limit.
        * include/db.php:

        (recursively_add_test_results): Handle empty $full_name to eliminate the loop over tests in store_test_results.
        Also verify that each test name, expected and actual results conform to the specific format to prevent XSS.
        Also use insert_row instead of select_or_insert_row to avoid issuing an unnecessary SQL query.
        (format_result): Extracted from format_result_rows. Used in failing-tests.php.
        * index.html:
        (TestResultsView): Added _currentBuilderFailureType and _currentBuilderDays.

        (TestResultsView._createTestResultRow): Compute the slowest run and also round time to tenth of second for time
        less than 10s or second if it's more than 10s so that the test time will always be shown in two digits.
        Also show the bug number and the latest expected result on the left columns after linkifying the bug numbers. 
        (TestResultsView._matchesFailureType): Added. Determines whether results is of a particular failure type.
        (TestResultsView._populateBuilderPane):
        (TestResultsView.fetchFailingTestsForBuilder): Store the failure type such as flaky, wrongtestexpectations.

        * main.css: Updated styles.
