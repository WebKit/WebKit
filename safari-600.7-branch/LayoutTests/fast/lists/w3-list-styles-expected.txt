I18N Tests: list-style-type

This page tests support for the CSS list-style-type property, as defined in CSS2.0.

Note: The CSS2.0 specification does not specify in any detail the mechanism for implementing the numbering schemes defined. Expectations for behaviour are based on the version of the CSS3 Lists module current at the time this test was last updated. In most cases, however, these tests simply allow you to see whether and how a particular user agent implements these features, rather than testing against the requirements of the specification.

Check whether the numbering of the lists is what you would expect.

The start attribute is used on ol to skip to higher numbers.
