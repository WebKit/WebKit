Test for bug 76701: map HTTP-EQUIV content-language to -webkit-locale. This particular test tests that the the pragma-set default language is set to the first sequence of non-whitespace characters of the content-language content. This expectation may change, see bug. This expectation is as per the HTML 5 spec. It appears that Firefox does not exactly do this, but trims the leading and trailing whitespace. It's unclear what IE does.

FAIL languageOfNode('x') should be ja_JP. Was '  \a\9\9ja-JP   \9  zh_CN \9\a\a\9\9'.
PASS languageOfNode('y') is "ar"
PASS successfullyParsed is true
