 
Test the focus controller working properly when switching focused frame. Here are the cases tested: 

-. Correct frame is focused when switching focus from one frame to another: 
1. main frame -> iframe 
2. iframe to main frame 
3. iframe 1 to iframe 2 

-. New setting focus request will be ignored if the focus controller is in the middle of switching focused frame (onblur, onfocus events): 
1. iframe 1 onblur sets iframe 2 focus. 
2. iframe 1 onblur sets iframe 1 focus. 
3. iframe 1 onfocus sets iframe 2 focus. 
4. iframe 1 onfocus sets iframe 1 focus.
