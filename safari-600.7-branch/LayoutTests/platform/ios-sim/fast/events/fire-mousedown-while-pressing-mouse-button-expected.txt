This test verifies that we fire a mousedown event whenever pressing and holding a mouse button A while simultaneously clicking with mouse button B, where A != B.
For each mouse button that is pressed and held, iterates through the possible second mouse buttons that can be clicked.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
