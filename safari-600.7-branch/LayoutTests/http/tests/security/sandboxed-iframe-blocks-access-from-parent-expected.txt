CONSOLE MESSAGE: Sandbox access violation: Blocked a frame at "http://127.0.0.1:8000" from accessing a frame at "http://127.0.0.1:8000".  The frame being accessed is sandboxed and lacks the "allow-same-origin" flag.
Sandboxing a frame puts it into a unique origin by default, which the containing document shouldn't have script access to. This test passes if a console warning is generated, noting the access violation.
