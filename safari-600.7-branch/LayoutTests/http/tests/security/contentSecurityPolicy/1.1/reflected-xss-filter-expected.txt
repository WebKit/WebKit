CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 4: The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in 'http://localhost:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?csp=filter&q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E' because its source code was found within the request. The server sent a 'Content-Security-Policy' header requesting this behavior.
Tests that 'X-WebKit-CSP: reflected-xss filter;' enables the XSSAuditor. This test passes if a console message is generated, and the script is blocked.
