CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 4: The XSS Auditor blocked access to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?notifyDone=1&valid-header=3&q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20see%20this%20message%20and%20no%20JavaScript%20alert()%20then%20the%20test%20PASSED.%3C/p%3E' because the source code of a script was found within the request. The server sent an 'X-XSS-Protection' header requesting this behavior.
CONSOLE MESSAGE: Blocked a frame with origin "http://127.0.0.1:8000" from accessing a frame with origin "null".  The frame requesting access has a protocol of "http", the frame being accessed has a protocol of "data". Protocols must match.

ALERT: URL mismatch: undefined vs. http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?notifyDone=1&valid-header=3&q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20see%20this%20message%20and%20no%20JavaScript%20alert()%20then%20the%20test%20PASSED.%3C/p%3E
This tests that the X-XSS-Protection header is not ignored when there is a trailing semicolon following mode=blank. Although theoretically malformed, we tolerate this case without issuing an error.
