        Previously auto formatting (initial pretty print of source code) in TextEditor
        was done synchronously in this order:
        
          (1) revealing the Editor as soon as we have content
          (2) set the CodeMirror value
          (3) pretty print with the CodeMirror editor
          (4) set the CodeMirror value
              => Layout
          
        At the end, CodeMirror would layout once with the new content. This approach
        performs very poorly when step (3) is an asynchronous action, because it would
        mean CodeMirror would layout for both (2) and at the end (4) and the layout
        itself can be very costly if the content is minified and so has very long
        lines at the top of the file that need to be syntax highlighted and visible
        since we do not wrap.

        This patch changes the order of operations to benefit asynchronous formatting.
        When SourceCodeTextEditor determines that it can autoformat it:

          (1) set the CodeMirror value
          (2) pretty print to source text
          (3) reveal the Editor when pretty printing is done
          (4) set the CodeMirror value
              => Layout

        This maintains the fact that to undo pretty printing we can just "undo" the
        editor to get the original text. This also means we only do a single
        CodeMirror layout, with the pretty printed and therefore more manageable
        source text for highlighting. It also means we continue to show a loading
        indicator in the editor while we are pretty printing. If this is truely
        done asynchronously, which is the case for JavaScript with FormatterWorker,
        then the loading indicator will animate smoothly.

        This sequence also works with the traditional synchronous formatters,
        which we still have for CSS.

        Web Inspector: Improve JavaScript pretty printing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156178
        <rdar://problem/25535719>

        Add a new EsprimaFormatter which pretty prints JavaScript source text
        using the Esprima AST and Tokens. Currently we use CodeMirror's
        tokenizer for pretty printing. By moving to Esprima for pretty
        printing we get a few advantages: (1) can be used within a Worker
        as there are no dependencies on DOM objects, (2) a full featured AST
        gives more context to handling individual tokens. One disadvantage
        is that Esprima requires valid input, so scripts with syntax errors
        will not work.

        EsprimaFormatter works by:
        - Getting the Esprima AST and token stream.
        - Walk all AST nodes:
          - when entering an AST node, handle any tokens before the start of this node
          - when leaving an AST node, handle any tokens that were inside the node
        - Whenever we handle a new node or token check if we should preserve any
          newlines or comments that do not show up in the AST or token stream.

        This allows us to handle any token based on its context. Currently the
        formatter prefers to operate on tokens based on their context. So the
        formatter has a case for each AST node type and handles the tokens
        within that AST node. A small exception is made to special case the
        handling of semicolons.

        Returns a list of query matches for a single resource, along with metadata

        in the resource (commonly used filename separators, the first character,
        and camel-case word boundaries).

        If there are remaining query characters after exhausting special characters,
        regular characters are matched starting from the last matched special
        character. Failing that, the algorithm attempts to find a match by backtracking.
        To backtrack, the last match is discarded and the query position decremented.
        If a special match is now the last match, matching starts again from the
        next character in the filename after the match. If a normal match is now
        the last match, keep discarding until a special match is found or no matches
        remain. The query fails if no matches remain. For example, consider:

           Query: "abcd"
           Filename: "AxBcdCx"

        The capital A, B, and C are all special characters, and are successfully
        matched with the first three query characters. Having exhausted the special
        characters the "d" at the end of the query is compared with the "x" at
        the end of the filename, and fails to match. Backtracking then kicks in.
        The last match, "C", is discarded and the search position in the query
        decremented. The search resumes after the next to last match, "B", and now
        matches the non-special characters "cd", yielding the following: "A Bcd  ".

        (WebInspector.ResourceQueryController.prototype._findSpecialCharacterIndices):
        Pre-processing step for resources. Locates the positions of special
        characters in the resource filename. Special characters are defined as:

           1. The first character
           2. Common filename separators, and the character immediately following.
           3. A capital letter that follows a lowercase character.

        Give each sample a duration based on the best time bounds we have available.
        Script Profiler Events give us time bounds for (nearly) all script evaluations.
        The only evaluations that are missed are Inspector scripts.

        The duration per-sample is computed per-event:

            durationPerSample = (event.endTime - event.startTime) / numSamplesInTimeRange.

        If a 10ms Script Event contains 5 samples, they would each get a 2ms duration.
        If a 0.5ms Script Event contains 1 sample, it would get a 0.5ms duration.

        In addition, this fixes a bug where we do not pop a state object off of openBraceStartMarkers if our indentCount
        is 0. Without doing this, we cannot reliably determine whether or not our while token needs to be inline or not.

        of user-configured timelines which are used to create the instrument list
        that is passed to new recordings.

        * Localizations/en.lproj/localizedStrings.js:
        New strings for "Edit" Timelines button.

        * UserInterface/Controllers/TimelineManager.js:
        (WebInspector.TimelineManager):
        Added setting for user-configured (enabled) timeline types.
        Initialized to the default timeline types.

        (WebInspector.TimelineManager.defaultTimelineTypes):

        Drive-by syntax error fixes: Array.prototype.contains doesn't exist.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineOverview.css:
        (.timeline-overview > .navigation-bar.timelines):
        (.navigation-bar.timelines .item.button.toggle-edit-instruments:not(.disabled):matches(:focus, .activate.activated, .radio.selected)):

        Styles for the "Edit" navigation bar above the timelines tree outline,
        and tree element styles for showing checkboxes and hiding the current
        selection while in edit mode.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineOverview.js:
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview):
        Create "Edit" button and navigation bar and add event handlers for
        capturing events, so that timeline editing can be closed and
        disabled when capturing begins.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype.set selectedTimeline):
        Prevent timeline selection while in edit mode.
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype.get editingInstruments):
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype.set viewMode):
        Prevent view mode change while in edit mode.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._instrumentAdded):
        Create a TimelineTreeElement, and insert into the tree outline and graph
        container in sorted order instead of appending timeline elements.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._toggleEditingInstruments):
        Handler for Edit button click event.
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._editingInstrumentsDidChange):
        Update UI in response to editing mode change: toggle CSS, enable/disable
        the timeline ruler and wheel/gesture events, and update Edit button appearance.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._updateEditInstrumentsButton):
        Update label text and button state.
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._updateWheelAndGestureHandlers):
        Add/remove event handlers based on editing state.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._startEditingInstruments):
        Enable edit mode UI. Placeholder elements are added for timelines that
        aren't included in the recording, and all tree elements have checkboxes
        for toggling their associated timelines.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._stopEditingInstruments):
        Disable edit mode UI. Unchecked instruments are first removed from the
        recording, then placeholder tree elements are removed, and their instruments
        added, as needed. TimelineManager's list of user-configured timeline types
        is then updated.

        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._capturingStarted):
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._capturingStopped):
        Enable/disable the Edit button. Quit editing mode when capturing starts.
        (WebInspector.TimelineOverview.prototype._compareTimelineTreeElements):
        Special sorting for the timelines tree outline. The sort order is:
            1. Instruments that are in the recording, except Rendering Frames.
            2. Instruments that aren't in the recording (placeholders).
            3. Rendering Frames.

        Timelines in groups 1 & 2 are sorted based on the order of the list returned
        by TimelineManager.availableTimelineTypes(). The Rendering Frames tree
        element must be last, since it's always hidden and would otherwise interfere
        with the alternating tree element CSS styles.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineRecordingContentView.css:
        (.content-view.timeline-recording.edit-instruments > .timeline-overview):
        (.content-view.timeline-recording.edit-instruments > .content-browser):
        Hide lower content browser and extend timelines tree height in edit mode.

        (WebInspector.TimelineRecordingContentView.prototype._instrumentAdded):
        (WebInspector.TimelineRecordingContentView.prototype._editingInstrumentsDidChange):
        Update CSS and TimelineOverview height when edit mode changes.
        (WebInspector.TimelineRecordingContentView.prototype.get timelineOverviewHeight): Deleted.
        No longer used.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineTabContentView.js:

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.genericClassNameForTimeline): Deleted.
        Helper functions now take a timeline type instead of a timeline object.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineTreeElement.js: Added.
        New tree element class to encapsulate behavior specific to the timelines
        tree outline, such as status element changes and disabling selection
        when editing.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTreeElement):

        This is the first inclusion of Workers into Web Inspector. In this case
        the Main side merely needs to make requests of the Worker and get back
        objects that it can interact with more.
        
        New file heirarchies:

            UserInterface/Proxies
                - new Proxy classes in the Main page.
                - treat like Model classes, but not quite model.

            UserInterface/Workers/HeapSnapshotWorker
                - new Worker classes for Workers. No WebInspector namespace.
                - no minification of these resources, they are simply copied.

        Remote procedure call interface between the Main/Worker page happens
        through the WorkerProxy and Worker classes. There are simple ways
        to perform factory style methods and call methods on objects, and
        get the result in a callback. Similiar to frontend <-> backend agent
        communication:

            HeapSnapshotWorkerProxy: (Main world)
                - creates the worker
                - performAction("actionName", arguments, callback)
                - callMethod(objectId, "methodName", arguments, callback)
                - handle message => dispatch event or invoke callback

            HeapSnapshotWorker: (Worker world)
                - sendEvent("eventName", eventData)
                - handle message => dispatch action or method on object
        
        Proxy object methods are boilerplate calls to performAction/callMethod
        with deserialization of responses. The rest of the frontend can just
        treat Proxy objects as Model objects with some data and async methods.

        Because the Node/Edge data is so small, objects are cheaply created
        when needed and not cached. This means that there may be duplicate
        HeapSnapshotNode's for the same node. For example if different Views
        both request instancesWithClassName("Foo"). This is fine, as none
        of our Views really care about object uniqueness, they are only
        interested in the data or querying for more data.

        * Scripts/combine-resources.pl:
        * Scripts/copy-user-interface-resources.pl:
        Copy the Workers directory to the resources directory.
        Its code is only meant to be loaded by Workers, so it
        shouldn't be included in the Main page.

        Web Inspector: Timelines UI redesign: use DataGridNode for TimelineView selection path components
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154954
        <rdar://problem/24947939>

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        This patch adds a new path component, TimelineDataGridNodePathComponent,
        for creating a path component from the current grid selection. This is
        needed since TimelineViews will no longer have an associated content tree
        outline once the navigation sidebar is removed.

        TimelineDataGridNode has new protected methods, "displayName" and
        "iconClassNames", which are used to populate hierarchical path components,
        create grid node data, and create cell content.

        TimelineView subclasses share a certain amount of boilerplate code for
        getting selection path components and handling path component selection.
        In the future we may be able to reduce this code by introducing a new
        DataGridTimelineView base class.

        and status elements (the progress spinner used for network resources) has been replicated in
        the appropriate TimelineDataGridNode classes.

        Duplicate logic contained in TimelineRecordTreeElement classes is left in place for now, but
        will be removed in <https://webkit.org/b/153036>.

        Web Inspector: Timelines UI redesign: relocate recording controls to TimelineTabContentView's content browser
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153532
        <rdar://problem/24361611>

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        This patch shifts UI controller responsibilities from the sidebar panel
        to the tab content view. Controls for starting/stopping the recording and
        switching view modes are now located in the tab's navigation bar, as is
        the hidden tree outline of open timeline recordings.

        * Localizations/en.lproj/localizedStrings.js:
        New UI strings. Renamed view-mode radio buttons located from the sidebar
        to "Events" and "Frames". UI for switching modes isn't final, and the
        labels may change or be removed entirely in favor of image-only buttons.

        * UserInterface/Main.html:
        New file.

        * UserInterface/Views/ContentBrowserTabContentView.js:
        (WebInspector.ContentBrowserTabContentView.prototype.contentBrowserTreeElementForRepresentedObject):
        (WebInspector.ContentBrowserTabContentView.prototype.treeElementForRepresentedObject):
        Allow subclasses to override behavior for retrieving the tree element
        for a represented object. Default behavior delegates the implementation
        to the navigation sidebar.

        (WebInspector.ContentBrowserTabContentView.prototype._contentBrowserCurrentContentViewDidChange):
        (WebInspector.ContentBrowserTabContentView.prototype._revealAndSelectRepresentedObject):
        (WebInspector.ContentBrowserTabContentView):
        (WebInspector.ContentBrowserTabContentView.prototype._revealAndSelectRepresentedObjectInNavigationSidebar): Deleted.
        Renamed to _revealAndSelectRepresentedObject as it's no longer specific
        to the sidebar.

        (WebInspector.TabContentView):
        (WebInspector.TabContentView.prototype.restoreStateFromCookie):
        (WebInspector.TabContentView.prototype.saveStateToCookie):
        A navigation sidebar shouldn't be required to save/restore cookie state.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineTabContentView.css: Added.
        (.timeline.tab.content-view .navigation-bar > .item.toggle-navigation-sidebar.activate.button):
        (.timeline.tab.content-view .navigation-bar > .item.record-start-stop):

        (.timeline.tab.content-view .navigation-bar > .item.record-start-stop *):
        (.timeline.tab.content-view .navigation-bar > .item.radio):
        Styles for new navigation items: record button and view mode radio buttons.

        * UserInterface/Views/TimelineTabContentView.js:
        Logic for maintaining the timeline recording hierarchy and the state
        of the active recording has been added to the tab content view.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.shown):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.hidden):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.canShowRepresentedObject):
        Objects other than recordings are no longer shown in the tab's content
        browser. Displaying other objects (such as timeline resources) in the
        content browser will be addressed in a follow-up patch: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154920.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.get supportsSplitContentBrowser):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.restoreFromCookie):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.saveToCookie):
        Persist view state that was previously located in the sidebar.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype.treeElementForRepresentedObject):
        Implements logic previously limited to the navigation sidebar. Only tree
        elements for timeline recordings are supported, since other represented
        objects (timeline resources) no longer have content tree outline tree elements.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._capturingStartedOrStopped):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._toggleRecordingOnSpacebar):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._toggleNewRecordingOnSpacebar):

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._recordingCountChanged):
        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._recordingLoaded):
        Implementations copied from the sidebar panel.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._recordingSelected):
        Implementation similar to that which existed in the sidebar panel, except
        that logic related to instruments isn't needed. Updates to timeline view
        filters will be implemented in a follow-up patch: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154924.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._viewModeSelected):
        This method is now limited to the handling of the radio button event only.
        Additional logic which existed in the sidebar panel's implementation has
        been pushed into _changeViewMode, which does the actual work of toggling
        view modes.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._changeViewMode):
        Updates the current view mode state. If triggered by a user selection (was
        called by the radio button event handler), the correct timeline view for
        the new mode is shown.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._showTimelineViewForType):
        Helper function for showing the view for the specified timeline type, if
        the timeline exists in the current recording. Otherwise the overview timeline
        view is displayed.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._displayedContentViewNavigationItemsDidChange):
        Keep the view mode in sync with the content browser.

        (WebInspector.TimelineTabContentView.prototype._getTimelineForCurrentContentView):
        Helper function for getting the currently displayed timeline.

        It seems as though there were race conditions between CodeMirror's event
        and the native mousemove such that if CodeMirror fired second, the current
        candidate was cleared, and would not reset itself until the cursor was
        moved, at which point the same issue could happen. To fix this, the current
        candidate is no longer cleared by CodeMirror's event and is instead only
        modified by the native mouse-events.

        Web Inspector: Add Context menu separators to Styles sidebar

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        In the Styles sidebar, there are three main sections for the context menu:
        - Copy and Duplicate/Show-source
        - Add pseudo-class rules
        - Add/Select pseudo-element rules
        These three sections were all put together in the same context menu, which
        was very crowded as a result. Separators have been added to make it so that
        these three sections are now separated and clearly show their different uses.

        time, current time, and end time now match the values in the timeline recording regardless of the

        Web Inspector: Tabs: Conflicts with multiple Formatters per SourceCode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144717
        <rdar://problem/20845163>

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        The underlying issue here is that each tab may create its own ContentView,
        and therefore SourceCodeTextEditor, per-SourceCode. Each SourceCodeTextEditor
        was mutating the SourceCode's state without listening for or expecting
        updates from the other. This causes a bunch of different issues:

            - editing in one tab does not get reflected in another tab for
              the same resource. This is common when using the Search tab
              to find and make an edit, then debug in another tab.

            - one tab may auto format (pretty print) a resource and set
              the formatter on the SourceCode to make SourceCodeLocations
              know about formatted locations. However, a jump to location
              that opens a new ContentView for the same Resource will
              start out un-formatted, and misunderstand the location.
              This often results in an unexpected jump to 0:0.

        The solution taken by this change is to have a single ContentView
        per represented object. When that ContentView gets shown in a new
        ContentViewContainer it gets transferred, leaving a tombstone in the
        previous ContentViewContainer that can be revived later. This keeps
        back foward lists with expected values. It also means there is a
        single ContentView that doesn't need to worry about having the
        state of its represented object getting overrun.

        Currently this makes the assumption that we won't ever show multiple
        ContentViews for the same represented object at the same time. This
        may need to change if we were to support split pane editor or
        something like that.

        This also makes the assumption that ContentViewContainer's showEntry
        and hideEntry do not modify the back forward list. That has not been
        the case, and I think it is safe to assume it will never be the case.

        The contracts this patch maintains:

            - a ContentView is always owned by one ViewContainer.
              This ViewContainer is the one showing the ContentView.

            - when another ViewContainer wants to share the ContentView
              ownership is transferred. Creating tombstones in the old
              ViewContainer and Reviving tombstones in the new ViewContainer.

            - ViewContainer's have a tombstone per-BackForwardEntry that
              references the ContentView.

            - In order to ensure a ContentView always gets closed, when
              the owning ViewContainer would close the ContentView it
              checks if it should instead transfer ownership of the
              ContentView to another interested ViewContainer.

        This also maintains the contract that a ContentView should only be
        closed once. When the ContentView is transferred between two
        ContentViewContainers it should hide/show from the old to the new.
        The last ContentViewContainer to reference a ContentView should
        be the one to close the ContentView.

        Web Inspector: Long values for comma separated CSS properties overflow the Visual sidebar area
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153890
        <rdar://problem/24510216>

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        For especially long values in comma-separated CSS properties (such as
        background-image), the text will not be clipped as expected due to the
        way in which the width is calculated for the element (the value, inside
        the title element, is the only child with a specified width other than
        100%). This overflowing causes the width of the section containing that
        property to expand, pushing content outside of the inspector window. To
        remedy this, a specified width is set on the relevant properties based
        on the width of the sidebar to ensure proper text clipping.

        Web Inspector: Hook the sampling profiler into the Timelines UI
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152766
        <rdar://problem/24066360>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        The main change in this patch is to swap in the SamplingProfiler
        in place of the LegacyProfiler. To do this, we've created a data
        structure called CallingContextTree which aggregates the SamplingProfiler's
        data into an easy to manage tree. To see how the data structure works,
        consider the following program:
        ```
        function bar() { // run code here for a long time. }
        function baz() { // run code here for a long time. }
        function foo() { bar(); baz(); }
        foo();
        ```
        From this program, we will create a tree like this:
                        (program)
                            |
                            |
                           foo
                           | |
                          /   \
                         /     \
                        bar     baz
        
        From this type of tree, we can easily create a CPUProfile payload
        object. Because the Timelines UI knows how to interact with the
        CPUProfile object and display it, we currently map the tree to this object
        to make it trivially easy to display the SamplingProfiler's data. In the future,
        we may want to find ways to work directly with the CallingContextTree instead
        of mapping it into another object.

        Slow addEventListener was the main cause of Console sluggishness[1].

        This patch changes:
        addEventListener from O(n) to O(1)
        removeEventListener from O(n) to O(1)

        Now, addEventListener and removeEventListener take <1ms regardless of the
        number of listeners attached.

        removeEventListener(null, null, thisObject), a special case when all events
        for thisObject are removed, was improved from O(n^2) to O(n).

        Web Inspector: cleanup TreeOutline class and separate styles from NavigationSidebarPanel
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153146

        This patch consolidates and simplifies the tree outline styles that were previously
        defined across various classes. A new stylesheet, TreeOutline.css, includes all
        the styles needed to create a basic TreeOutline.

        In addition, certain tree features which were previously controlled by manually
        toggling class names have been promoted to properties of TreeOutline:
         - compact: tree elements have reduced vertical spacing. Used by object trees.
           The compact and large settings are mutually exclusive.
         - large: tree elements (and their icons) are large. Used by TimelinesSidebarPanel.
           Previously there existed a `small` class name which was enabled in every
           case except TimelineSidebarPanel's Timelines tree. Since it was the rule rather
           than the exception the class has been removed and is now the default style.
         - disclosureButtons: control the appearance of disclosure buttons.
         - customIndent: control use of generated style rules.

        Web Inspector: Add support for the existing GradientEditor in the CSS Rules sidebar
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153004

        Both the Visual sidebar and Resource view have editors for CSS gradient
        values, but the Rules sidebar instead only adds editors for basic color
        values. Instead of duplicating the code for gradient swatches, existing
        code will be used to give this same functionality to the Rules sidebar.

        Web Inspector: Storage tab navigation bar should fit on a single line
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152473

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        The wrapping of the navigation bar on the Storage tab was caused by the
        fact that Sidebar.js used a minimum width of 200px, regardless of the
        content within the sidebar (unless it had a NavigationBar). Logic has
        been added that causes the sidebar to use the selected panel's own
        minimum width calculation if it is greater than 200px.

        items to control whether to capture protocol traffic and export it.
        In later patches, a reciprocal "Import..." context menu item will
        allow opening saved protocol traces and viewing them in a debug UI
        content view for debugging/visualizing protocol traffic.

        * UserInterface/Debug/CapturingProtocolTracer.js: Copied from Source/WebInspectorUI/UserInterface/Protocol/ProtocolTracer.js.

            This tracer saves everything into a flat array. JSON protocol
            messages are saved as escaped strings, in case they are not
            valid JSON. We want to be able to debug such scenarios.

            at any given time. The default tracer handles legacy logging
            behavior and always exists. The custom tracer is installed when
            the "Capture Protocol Traffic" context menu item is toggled.

            Dispatch to the array of active tracers at each trace point.
            Tracers now get the actual JSON message instead of a stringified

        Web Inspector: control whether to collect and dump protocol messages using a WebInspector.Setting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151635

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        When closing and reopening the inspector, the setting for whether
        to dump protocol messages should be persisted. Otherwise, enabling
        dumping from the debug-only UI will miss the initial flood of
        messages that are processed when the Inspector loads initial data.

        To support a persistent setting, and build some infrastructure for
        more advanced uses of collected protocol messages, this patch adds
        a new object to trace protocol events. It gets callbacks for each
        and implements the console-dumping functionality previously baked in
        to InspectorBackend.

        In follow-up patches, other protocol tracers will be added to save
        protocol data to disk, marshall it to a higher inspection level,
        or provide more fine-grained control over what is logged.

        This change moves Setting.js into the Base/ directory,
        since it is used by Views, Models, and now Protocol classes.

        Web Inspector: support runtime registration of tab type associations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151594

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        We want to add special tabs that only exist in engineering builds
        for debugging purposes. Though the relevant models and views can be
        put in the Debug/ directory to exclude them from production builds,
        there's no way to register tabs conditionally at runtime; tabs are
        hardcoded.

        This patch makes it possible to register new tab types at runtime.
        First, WebInspector keeps a map of known, registered tab classes.
        Details that were hardcoded before---whether to show in New Tab,
        whether a tab can be instantiated given the active domains, UI text,
        etc.---are now static methods on the base TabContentView or overidden
        in its subclasses. Lastly, a public method allows code in Bootstrap.js
        to register tabs at runtime. Doing so sends a notification so the
        NewTabContentView can show the newly available tab item.

        Web Inspector: TreeOutline should just dispatch events via WebInspector.Object
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148067

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        TreeOutline now dispatches most events via WebInspector.Object. The onselect and
        ondeselect callbacks are replaced by a SelectionDidChange event, which includes
        both the selected and deselected elements in its event data. The onexpand and oncollapse
        callbacks are replaced by an ElementDisclosureDidChange event. This is consistent with the
        behavior of onhidden, which had no corresponding onvisible callback.

        Alas, TimelineView and TreeOutlineDataGridSynchronizer depended on the order in which
        TreeOutline.onselect callbacks were chained together. The synchronizer added its
        callback after the timeline view, which ensured that the tree and grid were in sync
        before the view handled onselect and dispatched a SelectionPathComponentsDidChange.
        The change notification causes the view's path components to be read, and timeline
        views need the grid selection to be in a valid state to build path components.

        This is addressed by having timeline views dispatch SelectionPathComponentsDidChange
        events when the grid selection changes, instead of the tree selection. The change
        required that the synchronizer no longer suppress notifications when selecting grid nodes.

        Web Inspector: Spacebar to toggle Timeline recording doesn't work in Timeline tab after reloading the page
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151530

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        If reloading the page caused the console to clear, that was triggering
        the console prompt to be focused. When the console prompt is focused,
        keyboard input like Spacebar, was just inputing characters instead of
        triggering the keyboard shortcut that was expected.

        This also means that console.clear() in the inspected page would cause
        the inspector to focus the console. That is unexpected as well.

        Focusing the console prompt whenever the console log is cleared
        is not ideal. If we do want to focus the prompt the caller should
        make that determination, not clear.

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        When a parse error or other early error happens before the inspector
        is fully loaded, we can't use the second-level inspector to tell what's
        going on. It would be better to catch any early errors and list them.

        This patch adds an error page that shows the early errors that happened
        during loading. It provides a list of errors, a link to reload the
        inspector, and a link to submit a pre-filled bug report about the error.

        For now, this page only shows up in engineering builds because it's
        located in the Debug/ directory. We can move it later when it works
        better in all cases. Follow-up patches can address smaller issues,
        such as the transparent title bar and broken text selection.

        Web Inspector: Add context menu item to Reload the Inspector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141742

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add a global context menu and global shortcut (Cmd-Opt-Shift-R) to
        reload the Web Inspector frontend without closing the browser.

        This should make it possible to more quickly fix typos, small nits,
        etc. without having to relaunch. It might also make state
        restoration bugs more visible in engineering builds, since there
        is hardly any delay between seeing the old and reloaded frontends.

        Note that this functionality reloads scripts from the configuration's
        build directory, so you still need to "build" WebInspectorUI to ensure
        that any changed files are properly minified and staged.

        Web Inspector: allow multiple UI components to add menu items upon getting a "contextmenu" event
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151629

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        The existing Context Menu system assumes that only one UI component
        will need to provide context menu items. But in some scenarios, there
        are multiple UI components that could provide relevant menu items. For
        example, right-clicking on an DOM element in the console should show
        menu items relevant to 1) the DOM element, 2) the console in general,
        and 3) global menu items. Existing code shows menu items provided by
        the first object that handles the event and calls ContextMenu.show().

        This patch changes behavior so that a context menu can be built up
        by multiple 'contextmenu' event handlers. A ContextMenu instance is
        hidden on the 'contextmenu' event object; client code calls a
        factory method that digs out this existing context menu or creates a
        new one as needed. To actually show the context menu through the
        InspectorFrontendHost methods, the top-level app controller adds a
        bubbling listener for 'contextmenu' and shows the event's context
        menu if one has been created.

        Along the way, do some cleanup. Do s/var/let/, arrowize some functions,
        use Array.{map,some}, and simplify some other code as a result.

        No new tests yet, since we can't trigger context menu easily from
        an inspector test. All affected context menus were manually verified.

        Web Inspector: save Inspector's breakpoints to localStorage whenever they are modified

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Serialize all breakpoints to the "breakpoints" Setting in local storage
        whenever any breakpoint model object is added, removed, or modified.

        Remove the old listener that attempted to save breakpoints on the

        the browser via Cmd-Q or killing the process via Ctrl-C / SIGKILL.

        This is not expected to be a performance problem because most people
        do not keep thousands of breakpoints active, and breakpoints are not
        set very often. If it's a problem, we can mitigate it with coalescing.

        Web Inspector: inspector settings should not be shared between different inspection levels
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151151

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        It's really annoying to have shared settings between Inspector^1 and Inspector^2, because
        they are not designed to respond to external changes to local storage keys. As a result,
        the two inspectors seemingly have different settings while both are open, but the settings
        clobber each other depending on which inspector is closed first. On the next inspector
        being opened, it has settings that reflect whichever inspector closed last.

        To fix this, alter the local storage key prefix to incude the inspection level when it is
        greater than 1 (i.e., inspecting the inspector). The storage prefix becomes
        "com.apple.WebInspector-${inspectionLevel}." in this case.
        This is backwards-compatible for normal Inspector, who keeps the same storage prefix. 

        Alternate approaches that were considered and abandoned:

         - Use separate WKWebSiteDataStores for each inspection level. This API (as it currently is)
        does not support multiple on-disk storage locations. We don't want to add an entirely new
        Library directory for each inspector level, and sharing a single location doesn't fix the
        shared-settings bug. Changing storage location would lose all existing Inspector settings.

         - Sync settings between multiple open Inspectors. This would be catastrophic, as changing
        the active tab on one inspector would immediately propagate to the other open inspectors.
