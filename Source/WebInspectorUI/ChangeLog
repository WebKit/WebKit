        This patch fixes the broken CPU instrument when viewing a JSON timeline recordng.

        This exception is thrown when viewing a timeline recording that has been
        imported from JSON file. Aside from the exception, the code is functionally
        broken in this situation since passing a negative number to Array() doesn't work.

        I tested this change manually and selection ranges now behave as expected, and
        have not regressed in other instruments / UI.

        * UserInterface/Views/CPUTimelineView.js:
        Based on my investigation, the visibleEndTime is incorrectly computed when
        showing a JSON timeline recording because the currentTime property is always '0'.
        If this is the case, then let's assume that the entire range should be displayed.
