signal method of DOM event handling. For intance, where before a developer
would connect to the "click-event" signal, a developer must now call:
webkit_dom_event_target_add_event_listener. For a more illustrative example see:
http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/81486/trunk/Source/WebKit/gtk/tests/testdomdomwindow.c

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.3.6?

  - Update to compile with GTK+ 3.x 2.91.4.
  - Many, many other bugfixes.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.3.5
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.3.5?

    http://www.w3.org/TR/view-mode/ for details.
  - Fullscreen support for HTML5 media player.
  - Identify as WebKit/Safari in Google domains when

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.3.3
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.3.3?

  - Fixes to compile with latest GTK+ 2.90.x.
  - Add support for dropping content in WebKitWebViews.
  - Many other bugfixes.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.3.2
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.3.2?

*** This release is an ABI break ***

The library has been renamed to libwebkitgtk, so you'll need to
recompile your applications when upgrading to 1.3.2.

  - Add support for GTK+ 3.x. A new configure flag, --with-gtk, has
    been added, which allows to control which GTK+ version you want to
    build against. The default value is '2.0', for GTK+ 2.x
    support. With '3.0' the library will be compiled against GTK+ 3.x
    (2.90.4 or newer required). In the 3.x mode the .pc file has been
    renamed from webkit-X.X.pc to webkitgtk-X.X.pc, so you'll need to
    update your autotools setup accordingly.
  - Many fixes for the DOM bindings, including support to dispatch
    events to any Node through webkit_event_target_dispatch_event.
  - Added a 'inner-node' property to WebKitHitTestResult, carrying the
    DOM node where the hit test happened.
  - Many DnD fixes, including a fix for the infamous hang-of-death
    while dragging the mouse.
  - Support for <input type="range">.
  - Many other bugfixes.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.3.1
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.3.1?

  - Initial support for GObject DOM bindings. Present in this release
    is a substantial subset of the basic DOM APIs (Document, HTML
    elements, Node, etc) including access to the DOM events through
    GObject signals. Keep in mind that all the APIs are still
    unstable, and will probably be subject to changes before the next
    stable release.
  - Add webkit_web_back_forward_list_clear, to completely clear the
    BackForward list.
  - Lots of improvements in DOM clipboard and drag-drop access.
  - Add support for GTK+ key themes.
  - Significant improvements in a11y, including improved role support
    and many bugfixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.90
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.90?

  - Display server side messages during HTTP auth, since they
    sometimes contain important information for the authentication
    process.
  - Reduce creation time for WebKitWebView widgets by reusing
    dictionary structs used for spell-checking instead of creating a
    new one for each instance.
  - Implement WebKitWebView::geolocation-policy-decision-requested,
    emitted when a frame inside the WebView wants to get its position
    through geolocation.
  - Add WebKitWebSettings::enable-spatial-navigation to control
    whether Spatial Navigation is enabled or not. Spatial Navigation
    allows the user to move through the elements in a page using only
    the keyboard; this is similar to caret browsing, but with less
    focus on accessibility since instead of presenting the exact
    layout of the page to the user a more "logical" way of browsing
    through its contents is allowed. A specification of this feature
    can be seen at
    http://www.w3.org/TR/WICD/#current-focus-point-algorithm
  - Add a new build option, --enable-fast-mobile-scrolling. At the
    moment this only disables fixed backgrounds when there are no
    other fixed elements in a page, since they generally make
    scrolling very slow and thus are a big burden in some mobile
    environments.
  - GTK+ Input Method support has received a big overhaul, and most of
    them should work pretty well now.
  - All known redraw issues in the plugin support (especially with the
    Java plugin) have been fixed.
  - Various fixes to the MediaPlayer code to improve responsiveness
    and avoid lagging on position reporting.
  - Lots of bugfixes and other improvements.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.22
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.22?

  - Preliminary support for Java plugins. Basic functionality is
    there, but there are still a few rough edges. Also newly
    introduced is a new WebKitWebSetting, 'enable-java-applet', which
    controls whether WebKit will recognize the non-standard <applet>
    tag.
  - Add WebKitWebSettings::auto-resize-window; when enabled, WebKit
    will act upon the DOM methods that change the size and/or position
    of the window containing a WebView (window.{moveTo, resizeTo,
    moveBy, resizeBy}).
  - Add WebKitWebSettings::enable-file-access-from-file-uris; when
    enabled, each file:// URI will be assigned its own security
    domain.
  - Lots of bugfixes, especially in the PageCache support.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.21
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.21?

  - New custom-made GStreamer source element that uses the WebCore
    network layer to download media data; this makes sure any headers
    and cookies will automatically get added when making requests.
  - WebKit will now let libsoup know who the first party for a given
    message is, making it possible to implement accept/deny policies in
    Soup.
  - The usual stream of fixes, and improvements

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.20
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.20?

  - Fixes to the HTML5 Media Player infrastructure to satisfy sites
    that require cookies, and Referer to be sent; this makes
    WebKitGTK+ able to support the new HTML5 support added to Youtube,
    and Vimeo, for instance.
  - Windowless plugin support is finally here, making it possible to
    get plugins to behave on various web pages.
  - The usual stream of fixes, and improvements

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.19
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.19?

  - Improvements to AtkText implementation
  - RGBA colormap support has been added
  - Improvements to the HTML5 media player
  - Crashes related to clipboard handling, which were hitting many
    users and seemed to be random have been fixed

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.18
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.18?

  - Add methods to set and get a cache model in WebKitGTK+. We offer
    two possibilites: document viewer (no caches are used) and browser
    (similar to the previous defaults).
  - Add WebKitWebSettings::enable-page-cache. Controls whether the
    Page Cache is enabled or not. For details about what the page
    cache is and does see
    http://webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basics/
    The page cache is disabled by default, since the gtk+ port still
    presents some small bugs when it's enabled.
  - Add WebKitWebSettings::enable-site-specific-quirks. Controls
    whether a series of page-specific workarounds are used by WebKit.
  - Use Content-Encoding support available in libsoup 2.28.2 and
    newer.
  - Add WebKitWebSettings::enable-default-context-menu. Controls
    whether webkitgtk+ will show a default context menu on right click
    in the view. Note that even with the property set to FALSE right
    clicks can be handled by the page, either by actions or by
    ad-hoc in-page context menus.
  - Make the WebKitWebView::icon-loaded signal carry a string with the
    favicon's URI. This is an API break, but the signal already had a
    broken signature and was useless anyway, so it's extremely
    unlikely that anybody was using it. Also, add the 'icon-uri'
    property to the view, holding the URI for its current favicon.
  - Respect Content-Disposition header in downloads (fixes downloads
    in gmail).
  - Various accessibility improvements.
  - Many bugfixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.17
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.17?

  - New APIs to show and close the web inspector and to inspect an
    element at the given coordinates.
  - New property, WebKitWebSettings::tab-key-cycles-through-elements,
    controls whether TAB is simply interpreted as another keystroke or
    is used to cycle through the elements in a page.
  - Many a11y improvements.
  - The usual amount of random bugfixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.16
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.16?

  - Add optional support to generate the gobject-introspection
    gir/typelib files. Enable with --enable-introspection, it's off by
    default.
  - Add a new load status value, WEBKIT_LOAD_FAILED, emitted when
    there's an error during the load process. This is the natural
    companion to WEBKIT_LOAD_FINISHED, which is only emitted when the
    load finished succesfuly.
  - Ensure that keyboard events filtered by GtkIMContext still create
    the proper DOM events.
  - Many a11y improvements: caret browsing fixes, expose heading
    levels, more accessible roles supported, more work in correctly
    showing the element's ancestry list, improved support for lists,
    etc.
  - Many improvements to our media support.
  - Add a new setting to control DOM pastes
    (document.execCommand("Paste"))
  - Many, many bugfixes all over the place.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.15
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.15?

  - New API to get the subresources from a WebKitWebDataSource. This
    provides a way of accessing all the resources that compose the
    view to which the data source is attached.
  - A new function, webkit_web_view_get_hit_test_result, which allows
    to do a 'hit test' on the coordinates specified by a mouse
    event. A hit test provides context information about that point in
    the document, like whether it's an image, a link, an input box,
    etc.
  - Our DumpRenderTree implementation now supports eventSender, which
    allows us to run many more LayoutTests and make WebKitGTK+ more
    stable and feature-complete.
  - JSNES runs 6x faster: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/48573
  - The usual small improvements and bugfixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.14
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.14?

  - New API has been added to WebKitWebFrame to allow applying
    scrollbars policy as requested by web applications to the main
    frame; if the parent of the WebKitWebView widget is a
    GtkScrolledWindow, policy is applied by the default handler.
  - A new API has been added to help dealing with the various
    resources that are downloaded to compose the final rendering; you
    can now obtain the source code for a page that is loaded, for
    instance.
  - A new property has been added to WebKitWebView to allow setting it
    to "View Source" mode.
  - HTML5 database has gained API to manage the individual databases,
    including usage and quota.
  - A new signal `resource-request-starting' has been added to the
    WebKitWebView to allow modification of outgoing requests for every
    resource.
  - Connection limit has been increased to 60 total connections, 6
    per-host, matching other browsers more closely; this seems to have
    improved loading time of some sites.
  - Undo/redo support has been added to editable texts.
  - The usual stream of small improvements and bug fixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.13
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.13?

  - GNOME Keyring support was removed in favor of the new Password
    Manager soup feature; to get exactly the same behavior,
    applications should use SoupPasswordManagerGNOME. This requires
    libsoup 2.27.91 or newer.
  - Several accessibility improvements, including support for testing
    the a11y infrastructure in our layout tests.
  - You can now enable/disable HTML5 offline application cache using a
    new setting added to WebKitWebSettings.
  - Drag support has landed, meaning you can start playing with HTML5
    drag and drop support; drop support is still missing.
  - A crash with scripts closing windows has been fixed.
  - Image cursors support has been added.
  - The usual stream of small improvements and bug fixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.12
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.12?

  - Fix WebKitSoupAuthDialog to only save passwords in gnome-keyring
    (if enabled) when authentication succeeds.
  - Implement a proper size_request method for WebKitWebView. The
    widget will request the size of the whole page as its size
    requisition.
  - Many a11y improvements.
  - The usual amount of other misc fixes.
  - WEBKIT_DEBUG variable now accepts channel names in any case
    again.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.11
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.11?

  - WebKit has got a new feature - a XSS auditor, that should improve
    security; this feature is still experimental, and disabled by
    default, but applications can enable it using the setting.
  - The hackish content sniffing code that was beig used to avoid
    pages requesting downloads instead of displaying content has been
    replaced by usage of a new Soup feature, which implements proper
    content sniffing.
  - More accessibility work, including fixes for problems which were
    critical for a possible GNOME 2.28 release.
  - Pasting rich text from other browsers should now work as expected.
  - The usual amount of misc fixes.

=================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.10
=================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.10?

  - WebKitNetworkRequest has now GObject properties for its URI and
    the SoupMessage that backs it up.
  - Fix AtkText methods get_selection and get_n_selections to not use
    the global selection but only the selection that belongs to the
    object being used.
  - Fix a crasher when emitting the a11y signal 'text-caret-moved' in
    some situations with debug builds.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.9
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.9?

  - Scrolling once again received a lot of love, and many subtle
    problems and bugs were killed, and we now get correct behavior in
    acid2; a number of smaller improvements are in the queue.
  - Accessibility keeps gaining better support. On this release a lot
    of work was done on the AtkText interface implementation.
  - WebKitNetworkRequest now carries with it all the information
    regarding the request, not only the URI. This means you will no
    longer miss headers such as Referer when passing NetworkRequest
    objects from a callback to webkit_web_frame_load_request.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.8
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.8?

  - We found out that WebKitWebHistoryItems were being kept with a
    reference count of 2 instead of 1 as they should; nobody should be
    relying on that, but if you hit reference counting problems with
    items you were creating yourself, this is for you.
  - You can now copy images from the web page to the clipboard.
  - Improvements were made to the Plugin handling code.
  - Scroll events will now be correctly reported to web applications.
  - You can now embed arbitrary widgets as if it was a plugin, with
    the new "create-plugin-widget" signal.
  - The atk_text_get_text_{at,after,before}_offset methods are now
    implemented for all boundary types except LINE_AFTER and
    LINE_BEFORE.
  - The usual stream of minor fixes and improvements, as always.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.7
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.7?

  - This release includes a security fix:
    SVGList::insertItemBefore would not perform a bounds check on the
    index it was provided, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
  - New frame loading properties supersede various load-* signals, and
    are also accessible in the WebView, for convenience, making this
    API saner.
  - JIT is now supported for X86-64 on Linux, and enabled by default!
  - A regression on webkit_web_view_load_string has been fixed, making
    it work correctly again when the document uses encodings which may
    use more than 1 byte per character.
  - Yet more work has been done to the ATK support, caret browsing
    support improvements in particular.
  - Filenames suggested by the Download functionality now correctly
    use the filename given by the host, if available.
  - Build fixes for IA64, and AMD64
  - gtk-doc support has also improved, and you should now be able to
    cd WebKit/gtk/docs and type make docs, if you --enable-gtk-doc on
    configure, as long as you build  with srcdir == builddir.
  - More crashes and other bugs fixed, and small improvements made
    under the hood.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.6
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.6?

  - Several ATK support additions and fixes got landed, with many
    roles being now implemented, providing better accessibility.
  - Caret browsing is now available.
  - Spelling check has been implemented using Enchant; the API is
    still lacking, and some of the functionality still needs to be
    improved, though.
  - Error reporting is now available, with default error pages, and
    API that allows the application to override the default behavior;
    localization of those pages is still not supported, but planned.
  - More crashes and other bugs fixed.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.5
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.5?

  - Added gtk-doc support to the build system. It is not fully
    integrated yet, so some manual tweaking is still needed.
  - Minimum required GTK+ version is now 2.10.
  - Added l10n support with gettext. Translations are stored in
    WebKit/gtk/po/.
  - Many improvements to the ATK support. It's good enough to provide
    a basic user experience with Accerciser now, but we'll keep
    improving it in further releases.
  - New printing API that allows applications to control and monitor
    the printing process, when requested by javascript or started by
    the user.
  - Many bugfixes.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.4
================

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.4?

  - WebKitWebView gained uri and title properties, deprecating the
    usage of the title-changed signal.
  - Basic functionality for HTML5 media tags has been achieved; there
    are many unimplented methods, and rough edges still, though.
  - Font rendering received quite some love, with layouting, and
    memory handling fixes, and at least one less crash.
  - A new signal, new-window-policy-decision-requested, has been added
    to WebKitWebView, that makes it possible for the application to
    correctly decide what to do when new windows are requested.
  - A bug that made tooltips for consecutive links not update their
    location was fixed.
  - Several improvements were made to the HTTP backend, including
    making it more robust when talking to servers which send bad
    Content-Type headers.
  - WebKitWebView now uses the GtkBinding system to handle key events,
    which means that the user is now able to customize the keys used
    for various operations, and that many subtle bugs have been fixed.

================
WebKitGTK+ 1.1.3
================

The 1.1.3 release was just a quick bug fix release, because we made a
mistake in library versioning.

What's new in WebKitGTK+ 1.1.2?

  - Added support for downloads: a new signal, 'download-requested',
    will be emitted by WebKit when a dowload is requested. On top of
    that, the download process has been encapsulated in a new object,
    WebKitDownload, which allows the user to control it or to start
    new downloads from the client side.
  - Added webkit_web_view_get_encoding to get the automatic encoding
    of the current page.
  - Added GObject properties for 'encoding' and 'custom-encoding'.
  - Added 'javascript-profiling-enabled' property to the WebInspector,
    which allows to enable and disable the profiling functionality.
  - Added API to create and add history items to WebKit's history.
  - Improved debugging support with WEBKIT_DEBUG environment
    variable. Most of the settings will only give useful output for
    debug builds, but WEBKIT_DEBUG=Network will log all HTTP traffic
    form libsoup to console. See WebCore/platform/gtk/LoggingGtk.cpp
    for all the options available.
  - Lots of bugfixes.
