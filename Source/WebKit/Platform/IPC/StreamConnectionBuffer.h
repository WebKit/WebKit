// StreamConnectionBuffer is a shared "bi-partite" circular buffer supporting variable length messages, specific data
// alignment with mandated minimum size. StreamClientConnection and StreamServerConnection use StreamConnectionBuffer to
// communicate.
//
// The "bi-partite" is here to mean that writes and reads to the buffer must be continuous.
//
// The caller (client or server) "acquires" some amount of buffer data. The data pointer location depends on the amount
// of data being acquired. The buffer returns all the available capacity -- this may be less than acquired.
//
// The caller "releases" the some amount of data, at least the amount acquired but potentially more.
//
// Both the client and the server must release the same amount of data at the same step of the acquire/release sequence.
// Suppose the client releases first 8 and then 166 bytes. Upon the first acquire, the server must also release 8 bytes
// and then upon the second acquire 166 bytes. Due to how alignment and minimum length affect the position at which the
// memory can be referred to, the server cannot "read two times simultaneously" and release 174 bytes.
//
// The buffer also supports synchronous replies via "releaseAll/acquireAll" call pattern. The communication protocol can
// establish cases where the client transfers ownership of the data to the server. In these cases the server will
// acknowledge the read with "releaseAll" operation. The client will then read the reply via "acquireAll" operation. The
// reply will be written to the beginning of the buffer. This mandates that in-place data references in the buffer
// cannot be used simultaneously for message data and the reply data. In current IPC implementation, the message
// processing uses the in-place data references, while the reply data is first constructed to allocated memory and then
// copied to the message buffer.
//
// The circular buffer has following implementation:
// * The client owns the data between [clientOffset, serverOffset[. When clientOffset == serverOffset, the client owns
//   all the data.
// * The server owns the data between [serverOffset, clientOffset[.
// * The exception to the above is when communication protocol can contain messages that denote that the server will own
//   all the data.
// * The buffer can hold maximum of size - 1 values. The last value is reserved for indicating that the buffer is full.
//   FIXME: Maybe would be simpler implementation if it would use the "wrap" flag instead of the hole as the indicator.
//   This would move the alignedSpan implementation to the StreamConnectionBuffer.
// * All atomic variable loads are untrusted, so they're clamped. Violations are not reported, though.
