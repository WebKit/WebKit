namespace IPC {

// StreamConnectionBuffer is a shared "bi-partite" circular buffer supporting
// variable length messages, specific data alignment with mandated minimum size.
// StreamClientConnection and StreamServerConnection use StreamConnectionBuffer to communicate.
//
// The "bi-partite" is here to mean that writes and reads to the buffer must be
// continuous.
//
// The client (sender or receiver) "acquires" some amount of buffer data. The data pointer
// location depends on the amount of data being acquired. The buffer returns all the available
// capacity -- this may be less than acquired.
//
// The client "releases" the some amount of data, at least the amount acquired but potentially
// more.
//
// Both sender and receiver must release the same amount of data at the same step of the acquire/release sequence.
// Suppose sender releases first 8 and then 166 bytes. Upon the first acquire, receiver
// must also release 8 bytes and then upon the second acquire 166 bytes.
// Due to how alignment and minimum length affect the position at which the memory can
// be referred to, the receiver cannot "read two times simultaneously" and release 174 bytes.
//
// The circular buffer has following implementation:
// * Sender owns the data between [senderOffset, receiverOffset[. When senderOffset ==
// receiverOffset, sender owns all the data.
// * Receiver owns the data between [receiverOffset, senderOffset[.
// * The buffer can hold maximum of size - 1 values. The last value is reserved for
// indicating that the buffer is full. FIXME: Maybe would be simpler implementation if
// it would use the "wrap" flag instead of the hole as the indicator. This would move
// the alignedSpan implementation to the StreamConnectionBuffer.
// * All atomic variable loads are untrusted, so they're clamped. Violations are not reported,
// though.
// See SharedDisplayListHandle.
