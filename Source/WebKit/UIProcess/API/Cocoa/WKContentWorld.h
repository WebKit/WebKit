/*! @abstract A WKContentWorld object allows you to separate your application's interaction with content displayed in a WKWebView into different roles that cannot interfere with one another.
@discussion WKContentWorld objects should be treated as namespaces. This is useful for keeping your application's web content environment separate from the environment of the web page content itself,
as well as managing multiple different environments within your own application.
For example:
- If you have complex scripting logic to bridge your web content to your application but your web content also has complex scripting libraries of its own,
  you avoid possible conflicts by using a client WKContentWorld.
- If you are writing a general purpose web browser that supports JavaScript extensions, you would use a different client WKContentWorld for each extension.

Since a WKContentWorld object is a namespace it does not contain any data itself.
For example:
- If you store a variable in JavaScript in the scope of a particular WKContentWorld while viewing a particular web page document, after navigating to a new document that variable will be gone.
- If you store a variable in JavaScript in the scope of a particular WKContentWorld in one WKWebView, that variable will not exist in the same world in another WKWebView.
