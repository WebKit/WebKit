 @discussion This method should be implemented by the app to provide the extension with the ordered open windows. Depending on your
 app's requirements, you may return different windows for each extension or the same windows for all extensions. The first window in the returned
 array must correspond to the currently focused window and match the result of ``webExtensionController:focusedWindowForExtensionContext:``.

 window is not visible to the extension, the first window in the list returned by this method will be considered the presumed focused window. An empty result
 indicates no open windows are available for the extension. Defaults to an empty array if not implemented.
