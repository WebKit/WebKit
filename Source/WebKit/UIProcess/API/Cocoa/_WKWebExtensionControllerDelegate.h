 @discussion This method should be implemented by the app to provide the extension with a list of ordered open windows. Depending on your
 app's requirements, you may return different windows for each extension or the same windows for all extensions. The first window in the returned
 windows must correspond to the focused window and match the result of `webExtensionController:focusedWindowForExtensionContext:`.
 If `webExtensionController:focusedWindowForExtensionContext:` returns `nil`, indicating that no window has focus or the focused
 window is not visible the extension, the first window in the list returned by this method will be considered the presumed focused window. An empty result
 indicates no open windows are available for the extension. Defaults to empty array if not implemented.
