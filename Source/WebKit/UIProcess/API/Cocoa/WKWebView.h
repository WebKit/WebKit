 @discussion The completionHandler is passed the result of the script evaluation or an error.

 Passing nil is equivalent to targeting the main frame.
 If the frame argument no longer represents a valid frame by the time WebKit attempts to call the JavaScript function your completion handler will be called with a WKErrorJavaScriptInvalidFrameTarget error.
 This might happen for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:
     - The target frame has been removed from the DOM via JavaScript
     - A parent frame has navigated, destroying all of its previous child frames

 No matter which WKContentWorld you use to evaluate your JavaScript string, you can make changes to the underlying web content. (e.g. the Document and its DOM structure)
 Such changes will be visible to script executing in all WKContentWorlds.
 Evaluating your JavaScript string can leave behind other changes to global state visibile to JavaScript. (e.g. `window.myVariable = 1;`)
 Those changes will only be visibile to scripts executed in the same WKContentWorld.
 evaluateJavaScript: is a great way to set up global state for future JavaScript execution in a given world. (e.g. Importing libraries/utilities that future JavaScript execution will rely on)
 Once your global state is set up, consider using callAsyncJavaScript: for more flexible interaction with the JavaScript programming model.

/* @abstract Calls the given JavaScript string as an async JavaScript function, passing the given named arguments to that function.
 @param functionBody The JavaScript string to use as the function body.
 @param arguments A dictionary representing the arguments to be passed to the function call.
 @param frame A WKFrameInfo identifying the frame in which to call the JavaScript function.
 @param contentWorld The WKContentWorld in which to call the JavaScript function.
 @param completionHandler A block to invoke with the return value of the function call, or with the asynchronous resolution of the function's return value.
 @discussion The functionBody string is treated as an anonymous JavaScript function body that can be called with named arguments.
 Do not format your functionBody string as a function-like callable object as you would in pure JavaScript.
 Your functionBody string should contain only the function body you want executed.

 For example do not pass in the string:
 @textblock
     function(x, y, z)
     {
         return x ? y : z;
     }
 @/textblock

 Instead pass in the string:
 @textblock
     return x ? y : z;
 @/textblock

 The arguments dictionary supplies the values for those arguments which are serialized into JavaScript equivalents.
 For example:
 @textblock
     @{ @"x" : @YES, @"y" : @1, @"z" : @"hello world" };
 @/textblock

 Combining the above arguments dictionary with the above functionBody string, a function with the arguments named "x", "y", and "z" is called with values true, 1, and "hello world" respectively.

 Allowed argument types are:
 NSNumber, NSString, NSDate, NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSNull.
 Any NSArray or NSDictionary containers can only contain objects of those types.

 Passing nil is equivalent to targeting the main frame.
 If the frame argument no longer represents a valid frame by the time WebKit attempts to call the JavaScript function your completion handler will be called with a WKErrorJavaScriptInvalidFrameTarget error.
 This might happen for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:
     - The target frame has been removed from the DOM via JavaScript
     - A parent frame has navigated, destroying all of its previous child frames

 No matter which WKContentWorld you use to call your JavaScript function, you can make changes to the underlying web content. (e.g. the Document and its DOM structure)
 Such changes will be visible to script executing in all WKContentWorlds.
 Calling your JavaScript function can leave behind other changes to global state visibile to JavaScript. (e.g. `window.myVariable = 1;`)
 Those changes will only be visibile to scripts executed in the same WKContentWorld.

 Your completion handler will be called with the explicit return value of your JavaScript function.
 If your JavaScript does not explicitly return any value, that undefined result manifests as nil being passed to your completion handler.
 If your JavaScript returns null, that result manifests as NSNull being passed to your completion handler.

 JavaScript has the concept of a "thenable" object, which is any JavaScript object that has a callable "then" property.
 The most well known example of a "thenable" object is a JavaScript promise.
 If your JavaScript returns a "thenable" object WebKit will call "then" on the resulting object and wait for it to be resolved.

 If the object resolves successfully (e.g. Calls the "fulfill" function) your completion handler will be called with the result.
 If the object rejects (e.g. Calls the "reject" function) your completion handler will be called with a WKErrorJavaScriptAsyncFunctionResultRejected error containing the reject reason in the userInfo dictionary.
 If the object is garbage collected before it is resolved, your completion handler will be called with a WKErrorJavaScriptAsyncFunctionResultUnreachable error indicating that it will never be resolved.

 Since the function is a JavaScript "async" function you can use JavaScript "await" on thenable objects inside your function body.
 For example:
 @textblock
     var p = new Promise(function (f) {
         window.setTimeout("f(42)", 1000);
     });
     await p;
     return p;
 @/textblock

 The above function text will create a promise that will fulfull with the value 42 after a one second delay, wait for it to resolve, then return the fulfillment value of 42.
