What's new in WPE WebKit 2.31.1?

  - Remove support for NPAPI plugins.

  - Add new API to remove individual scripts/stylesheets using WebKitUserContentManager.

	For the time being this has to be enabled at runtime through the
	WEBKIT_GST_ENABLE_AUDIO_MIXER=1 environment variable.
  - On-demand GStreamer initialization support, mostly contained to WebProcess.
    GStreamer used to be initialized unconditionally once from the UI process
	and once from the WebProcess. GStreamer is now used mostly only from the
    WebProcess, even for audio/video capture devices probing. Users of the
    webkit_web_view_can_show_mime_type API will still trigger GStreamer
    initialization in the UIProcess though.
  - ImageDecoder video decoder switched to decodebin3.
  - WebAudio to MediaStream support.
  - Multi-channel (>2) support for the AudioFileReader.
