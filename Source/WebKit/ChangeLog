            Remove the protection to spin more than one service worker process at a time.
            rdar://problem/55044713

            Before site isolation, we were creating one service worker process for all domains.
            We now create one service worker process per domain, which makes the protection to only spin
            one service worker process potentially harmful: if two requests to create a service worker processes
            for two different domains are made, only one will actually succeed.
            This is reproduced by API test.

            At UIProcess side, there is already a check to see whether a service worker process for a given domain is launched.
            That protects against spinning several service worker processes for the same domain.

    [iOS] When hit testing for a context menu interaction, do not consider whether the element is contenteditable
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202498
    <rdar://problem/54723131>

    Source/WebCore:
    
    When the user selects a context menu action, WebKit performs a hit test in order to find the
    acted-on element on the page. This is separate from the hit test performed to generate the
    context menu's targeted preview. Since an arbitrary amount of time can elapse between
    preview generation and action selection, this second hit-tests might return a different
    element.
    
    One case where we know a different element can be returned is in apps that dynamically
    enable and disable editing. If editing is disabled when the first hit test occurs but is
    enabled when the second one occurs, different elements will be returned due to
    Frame::qualifyingNodeAtViewportLocation preferring to return the root editable element when
    the approximate node is contenteditable.
    
    While the appropriate long-term fix is to only hit-test once and use that element for both
    preview generation and action selection, this patch implements a short-term fix to address
    the specific problem in rdar://problem/54723131 by disabling the contenteditable behavior
    described above for context menu interaction hit testing.
    
    The long-term fix is tracked by <https://webkit.org/b/202499>.

    [iOS] Lock screen controls can fail to play web content

    Reviewed by Chris Dumez.
    
    When playback is paused from the lock screen via Now Playing controls, the WebProcess,
    UIProcess, and Network Process will all be suspended. MediaRemote will take an assertion
    and wake up the WebProcess when a remote control command to "play" is sent via the Now
    Playing controls. However, if a synchronous message to the (suspended) Network or UIProcess
    is issued before the notification that the process was unexpectedly unsuspended can be
    issued (which will subsequently unsuspend the UIProcess and Network process), we can get
    into a deadlocked state where the main thread is blocked on the sync message to a suspended
    process.
    
    To work around this problem, move all the processing from ProcessTaskStateObserver to a
    WorkQueue / background thread. This requires making the ProcessTaskStateObserver thread-safe,
    though its only current client is a Singleton (the WebProcess class), and so the risk of
    thread safety issues is currently minimal. Regardless, access to the Client pointer must be
    guarded by a Lock, and the Client itself must become ref-counted, so that the
    ProcessTaskStateObserver can ref its Client (the WebProcess) during callback processing.
    
    Unfortunately, sendWithAsyncReply() is not thread safe, nor is ProcessAssertion, so instead
    just use send() and set a 5-second timeout before expiring the assertion, and just use
    BKSProcessStateAssertion directly.

    Source/WebKit:
    
    When using the data activation page on www.att.com, one of the sections on the page contains several select
    elements; in the case where the user agent:
    
    1. contains the string "iPad", and
    2. does not contain the string "Safari"
    
    ...www.att.com's data activation page will opt into a mode where it adds blur event listeners to the select
    elements; in this blur event listener, www.att.com proceeds to programmatically focus a non-editable div element
    after a 1 second timeout. The reasons for this behavior remain unclear to me, though it's worth noting that the
    blur event handler name is "screenReaderFocus", which suggests that this is in place to ensure compatibility
    with screen readers.
    
    In iOS 12, dismissing the popover would blur the focused select menu with an animation. Since the animation
    would take a slightly less than 1 second, www.att.com's logic would have the effect of moving focus to the div
    element shortly after dismissing the select menu. However, after r243808, we no longer attempt to blur the
    focused select element when dismissing the popover. This means that the select element is only blurred the next
    time the user activates another focused element, such as one of the input fields on the page, or a different
    select element. Consequently, the logic to move focus into a div element now occurs only after a different
    element has already been focused; this results in focus moving away from newly focused elements after 1 second
    in the case where a select element has previously focused.
    
    To mitigate this, restore iOS 12 behavior behind a site- and app-specific quirk. See comments below for more

    * Shared/WebPreferences.yaml:
    
    Enable site-specific quirks by default in WKWebView. With regards to this bug, this change allows for

            [iPadOS] [DataActivation] Focus moves away after focusing input fields on www.att.com
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202167
            <rdar://problem/55185021>

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            When using the data activation page on www.att.com, one of the sections on the page contains several select
            elements; in the case where the user agent:

            1. contains the string "iPad", and
            2. does not contain the string "Safari"

            ...www.att.com's data activation page will opt into a mode where it adds blur event listeners to the select
            elements; in this blur event listener, www.att.com proceeds to programmatically focus a non-editable div element
            after a 1 second timeout. The reasons for this behavior remain unclear to me, though it's worth noting that the
            blur event handler name is "screenReaderFocus", which suggests that this is in place to ensure compatibility
            with screen readers.

            In iOS 12, dismissing the popover would blur the focused select menu with an animation. Since the animation
            would take a slightly less than 1 second, www.att.com's logic would have the effect of moving focus to the div
            element shortly after dismissing the select menu. However, after r243808, we no longer attempt to blur the
            focused select element when dismissing the popover. This means that the select element is only blurred the next
            time the user activates another focused element, such as one of the input fields on the page, or a different
            select element. Consequently, the logic to move focus into a div element now occurs only after a different
            element has already been focused; this results in focus moving away from newly focused elements after 1 second
            in the case where a select element has previously focused.

            To mitigate this, restore iOS 12 behavior behind a site- and app-specific quirk. See comments below for more
            details.

    [iOS 13] Tapping on a non-editable text selection should toggle callout bar visibility instead of clearing selection

    In iOS 13, tapping a text selection should toggle callout bar visibility (i.e. "selection commands" in UIKit).

    Page temporarily jumps to an excessively small viewport scale while loading usatoday.com

    Source/WebCore:
    
    On some pages (e.g. usatoday.com), the content width of the page temporarily becomes very large during page
    load. This causes a couple of viewport scaling behaviors (notably, the existing shrink-to-fit heuristic in
    ViewportConfiguration::initialScaleFromSize, as well as the new iPad-specific content-aware shrink-to-fit
    heuristic in WebPage::immediatelyShrinkToFitContent) to cause the page to shrink down excessively in an attempt
    to fit all the content to the viewport. This causes a very ugly flash as the page appears zoomed out initially
    during page load, before zooming back in.
    
    To fix this, we add some sanity checks to these viewport scaling heuristics. In ViewportConfiguration's
    initialScaleFromSize method, in the codepath where an initial scale is not specified, we always scale to fit the
    contents of the page; instead, detect the case where the content width is enormous (with a threshold arbitrarily
    chosen to be 1920) and fall back to the scaling to fit the viewport's width, if such a width has been explicitly
    set. This ensures that we avoid excessive shrinking in the case where content is extremely wide, but also that
    we do scale the viewport down to fit all the content in the case where the content isn't extremely wide (e.g. on
    daringfireball.com).

    While double tapping,
    1. the first tap triggers a click event through the normal _singleTapIdentified/_singleTapRecognized codepath.
    2. and the second tap should trigger either
      a second single click event or
      a second single click followed by a dblclick event when dblclick handler is present.
    However the second click is dropped on the floor when the node under the cursor does not have a dblclick handler (see handleDoubleTapForDoubleClickAtPoint()) -so we end up sending one click event.
    
    This patch fixes this case by sending the second tap through the normal single tap flow when the dblclick handler is not present.

            Create InjectedBundle SPI to better support NSSecureCoding
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201810
            <rdar://problem/55265713>

            The encoding/decoding routines used by WebKit’s InjectedBundles are based on NSCoding.
            While we have changed WebKit internals to use NSSecureCoding, there are a number of
            injected bundles that need to serialize custom classes between the InjectedBundle and
            the relevant WebKit UIProcess.

            We need to lock down this communications channel by enforcing NSSecureCoding.

            This patch creates new SPI to allow the UIProcess to specify classes that it will accept
            in messages from the WebContet Process (and Injected Bundle).

            It adds the following property to the WKProcessPoolConfiguration:

                @property (nonatomic, copy) NSSet<Class> *customClassesForParameterCoder;

            If no custom classes are specified, the standard serialization primitives are supported:
                NSArray, NSData, NSDate, NSDictionary, NSNull, NSNumber, NSSet, NSString,
                NSTimeZone, NSURL, and NSUUID.

    Regression(iOS 13) web views do not deal properly with their window's UIScene changing

    Web views do not deal properly with their window's UIScene changing. If a Safari window is in the
    background for 1 minute, its UIScene will be detached and the window will get a new UIScene if
    the user later switches to this window. Our web views listen to UIScene notifications to determine
    their visibility and currently stop receiving visibility updates once the window’s UIScene has
    changed. This causes view freezes because our WebContent process does not know its view is visible
    and keeps its layer tree frozen.
    
    Previously, when our view would be added to a window, we would get this window's UIScene and listen
    for UISceneDidEnterBackgroundNotification / UISceneWillEnterForegroundNotification for this UIScene
    object. Instead, we now listen to these notifications for ALL the application's UIScenes. Our handler
    then checks if the notification's UIScene object matches the current window's UIScene before
    forwarding the notification to the rest of WebKit.

    content, and matching up the images in the resulting fragment against the placeholder images. If each image in

    migrate attachment elements over to the placeholder images if needed, and finally discard the fragment.

    accordingly to each item provider's preferredPresentationSize.
    
    To make this compatible with Mail compose (and all other known internal clients that use the _editable SPI), we

    Source/WebKit:
    
    Our current logic for handling dropped content in editable elements on iOS works like this in the ideal case:
    
    (1)     UIKit asks us for a targeted preview for each UIDragItem. We don't know (and can't determine this
            synchronously without blocking on the web process) so we simply retarget the preview to animate to the
            last known caret location.
    
    (2)     Soonafter, UIKit hands us a drop preview update block, which may be used to retarget the drop preview
            once, as long as the drop animation is less than 90% complete. We stash these update blocks for now.
    
    (3)     -dropInteraction:performDrop: is then called, and we start loading item provider data right away.
    
    (4)     When the data has finished loading, we perform the drop in the web process. After any inserted images
            have finished loading, we take snapshots (of the dropped content as well as surrounding web content
            minus the dropped content), and deliver these images to the UI process via TextIndicatorData.
    
    (5)     Upon receiving the TextIndicatorData sent in (4), we use the image data to create updated targeted drag
            previews, and use these to invoke the preview update blocks we stored earlier in (2). We also obscure
            the entire web view with a snapshot of the view minus any dropped content, such that the updated drop
            previews may animate into place without also showing the final content.
    
    (6)     When the drop animation ends, we remove the unselected content snapshot view added in (5) simultaneously
            as the targeted previews disappear, revealing the actual dropped content on the page. The drop is now
            complete.
    
    However, note that the drag update block we invoke in (5) doesn't work if the drop animation is already more
    than 90% complete. Since the lifecycle of the drop animation is distinct from that of item provider loading, if
    the delay between (3) and (4) exceeds 90% of the total drop animation time, we'll fail to update the targeted
    previews, such that the user only sees the initial drag preview fly on top of the caret and disappear. While we
    typically win this race for data dragged from other WebKit apps, we almost always lose when dragging from Photos
    and end up with a janky drop animation. This is especially true for any images that aren't locally available,
    and need to be fetched from iCloud. An additional problem is that in step (5), we use the same final snapshot to
    update the drop preview of every item, since we don't have a snapshot for the fragment corresponding to each
    individual dropped item.
    
    To address these issues for Mail in the case where the user drops images with known sizes (i.e. -[NSItemProvider
    preferredPresentationSize] is specified), we introduce an alternate codepath for handling dropped images that
    performs the drop immediately upon receiving -dropInteraction:performDrop: in the UI process. Since the data has
    yet to arrive, we instead handle the drop by inserting placeholder image elements at the drag caret position,
    which initially have no source but are sized to fit their expected final image sizes. After doing so, we
    snapshot the page (minus the dropped content range, as usual) and deliver this snapshot to the UI process, along
    with the rects (in root view coordinates) of each placeholder image that was inserted. In the UI process, we
    then take this snapshot and obscure the content view with it, and also use each of the placeholder rects to
    provide an updated target for each drag preview, such that the drop previews now animate to their final
    locations on the page.
    
    When the data eventually arrives, we handle the drop by detecting the placeholder elements we inserted earlier,
    and using the dropped data to update the source attribute and attachment backing for each of these placeholder
    elements instead of attempting to insert new content.
    
    Note that this codepath is currently only enabled for SPI clients that set -[WKWebView _editable] to YES, since
    it involves us performing the editing action for the drop (thus changing the DOM) prior to the preventable drop
    event, and prior to us having any data at all. However, the drop event can't come before the editing action,
    since we need to have already loaded data from the item providers to expose it via the dataTransfer of the drop
    event. This contradiction means that this image placeholder hack is only for _editable SPI clients that, at the
    very least, will not require preventing default behavior when dropping only images with predetermined sizes.

            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202012
            <rdar://problem/55285295>

            Reviewed by Geoff Garen and Brent Fulgham.

            r248832 inadvertently reverted the fix for Mail that landed in r247400 by not using
            the same logic to initialize the sandbox extension if the process had already
            finished launching or not. In particular, the new code path that happens on process
            launch unconditionally used '/' as resource directory for the sandbox extension if
            the client did not provide one. The logic in maybeInitializeSandboxExtensionHandle()
            would use the file URL's base URL as resource directory when creating a sandbox
            extension for '/' would fail (which it often does).

            To address the issue, have the logic that runs on process launch call
            maybeInitializeSandboxExtensionHandle() so avoid duplicating code and make sure
            both cases now have the Mail fix.

            Nullptr crash in Page::sessionID() via WebKit::WebFrameLoaderClient::detachedFromParent2()
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201625

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            This is based on a patch from Ryosuke Niwa.

            The crash was caused by WebFrameLoaderClient::sessionID() calling WebPage::sessionID() without
            checking the nullity of WebPage::m_page which can be null. Added a null check.

            Because passing a wrong session to RemoveStorageAccessForFrame could result in a leak, this patch
            also replaces m_hasFrameSpecificStorageAccess boolean with an optioanl struct which stores
            session ID, frame ID, and page ID even after WebCore::Frame or WebCore::Page had been cleared
            or before WebFrameLoaderClient::m_frame is set.

    When computing the new layout viewport rect in ScrollingTreeFrameScrollingNode, use
    "StickToDocumentBounds" mode, not "StickToViewportBounds", because otherwise we'll compute
    a layout viewport that has negative top/left offsets which causes fixed elements to jump outside
    the viewport. The only code that should be moving things outside the viewport (a temporary effect
    that happens when pinching) is the 'isBelowMinimumScale' path in WebPageProxy::computeCustomFixedPositionRect().
    
    With this change ScrollingTreeFrameScrollingNode no longer needs m_behaviorForFixed; it can be removed later.
    
    Not currently testable, since it involves pinching in past minimum zoom and transients state.

    we get new layers from the web process (added in RemoteLayerTreeDrawingAreaProxy::commitLayerTree()

    This patch makes 2 improvements:
    1. It makes AuxiliaryProcessProxy::state() return Terminated if we still have a connection but

    2. When the UIProcess is about to get suspended, have the process pools terminate their non-critical

       other apps on the system when suspended with regards to memory. Also, it makes it less likely

    There is a race condition when starting a load of a local file, where the WebContent process has not finished
    launching yet, and its pid is not available. When we try to create a sandbox extension by using the pid of the
    WebContent process, it is not available in the cases where the WebContent process has just launched and has not
    finished launching yet. This patch creates a new dummy Web page message, 'LoadRequestWaitingForPID', which will
    be sent instead of a normal 'LoadRequest' message, and only when the WebContent process has not finished
    launching. When the WebContent process has finished launching, and we are about to actually send the pending
    messages, we can detect that a 'LoadRequestWaitingForPID' has been appended for sending, and replace it with a
    normal 'LoadReqest' message where we have created the sandbox extension issue with a valid pid. The message
    'LoadRequestWaitingForPID' is never intended to reach the WebContent process, it is just there to replace with
    a normal 'LoadRequest' message with a new sandbox extension. In the implementation of the message handler on
    the WebContent process side, we assert that the method is never called. This patch makes sure the ordering of
    the Web page messages are the same, even when we modify the message.

    Source/WebCore:
    
    Editor::replaceSelectionWithFragment currently scrolls to reveal the selection after inserting the given
    DocumentFragment. However, this scrolling occurs before any inserted images have loaded yet, which causes the
    wrong caret rect to be revealed, since all image elements inserted during paste will be empty.
    
    To fix this, we defer revealing the selection after inserting the fragment until after all images that have
    been inserted are done loading. While waiting for images to load, if any layers which may be scrolled as a
    result of revealing the selection are scrolled, we additionally cancel the deferred selection reveal. See
    comments below for more detail.

    Long presses that interrupt accelerated scrolling dispatch clicks on apps linked against iOS 12 or earlier

    For apps that are linked on or after iOS 13, we add a context menu interaction to the content view, which
    requires us to disable (or avoid adding) the highlight long press gesture recognizer. However, for apps that are
    linked on the iOS 12 SDK or prior, this gesture is still present, and fires when long pressing for (roughly) up
    to 0.75 seconds if a tap gesture was not recognized instead. Firing this gesture sends a click event to the
    page; this brings back some form of <rdar://problem/53889373>, but only when holding for slightly longer than a
    normal tap, and also only in apps linked on iOS 12 or earlier. To fix this, we apply a similar solution as in
    r248433 and detect whether a long press gesture interrupted scroll view deceleration in
    -gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:. If so, we return NO to avoid clicking. See per-method comments below for more
    details.
    
    Testing this bug as-is was tricky, since there's no way in layout tests to simulate being linked on or before a
    given SDK version. Luckily, recall that:
    1. This bug occurs when the highlight gesture recognizer is enabled and added to the content view.
    2. The highlight gesture recognizer only needs to be disabled or removed when context menu interaction is added.
    As such, we should be able to restore the highlight gesture recognizer by suppressing the context menu
    interaction in an app linked-on-or-after iOS 13, by setting allowsLinkPreview to NO. Unfortunately, this doesn't
    quite work, since we currently always avoid adding the highlight gesture recognizer if the app is linked on
    iOS 13 or later.
    
    However, this means that the highlight gesture recognizer is absent from the content view in apps linked against
    iOS 13 that disable link previews, even though its absence is not required. This means that long pressing a
    clickable element in a web view that disables link previews does not show a tap highlight on iOS 13, whereas it
    would on iOS 12; this is a regression, albeit a very subtle one. To fix this subtle issue and make it possible
    to write a test for this bug, we refactor some logic for creating and configuring the highlight long press
    gesture, such that we now unconditionally add the highlight gesture, but only enable it in apps linked on or
    after iOS 13 if link previews (i.e. context menu interaction) are not allowed.

    Caret does not appear in text field inside a transformed, overflow: hidden container

    Source/WebCore:
    
    This patch refactors the heuristic for determining whether to suppress selection gestures and UI in a way that
    fixes the corner case encountered in this bug. To understand why this test case fails with our existing
    heuristic, consider the below test case.
    
    Let's say we have an input field inside an "overflow: hidden;" container, which is positioned in such a way that
    it is completely clipped by its enclosing container which is also "overflow: hidden". Our existing logic would
    appropriately identify this as a hidden editable element.
    
    However, let's now apply a transform to the input field's closest "overflow: hidden" ancestor, such that the
    field is now visible. Since RenderLayer::offsetFromAncestor doesn't take transforms into account when we try to
    find the offset of the "overflow: hidden" layer relative to the root view, we end up passing an offsetFromRoot
    of (0, 100vw) to RenderLayer::calculateClipRects, which computes a background clip rect of (0, 0, 100vw, 100vh).
    
    This means that at the end of RenderLayer::calculateClipRects, we end up intersecting the background clip rect
    (0, 0, 100vw, 100vh) against (100vw, 0, 100vw, 100vh), which results in the empty rect, and subsequently makes
    us believe we're editing a hidden editable element.
    
    Instead of tacking on more logic to isTransparentOrFullyClippedRespectingParentFrames, we can fix this by using
    RenderObject::computeVisibleRectInContainer instead, performing a similar walk up the render tree to compute the
    visible rect of each focused element or subframe relative to its root. This is capable of taking transforms into
    account. See comments below for more details.

    check looks for renderers that are completely empty relative to their root views.

    During EditorState computation, we use the hidden editable element heuristic to determine whether we should
    begin suppressing selection gestures and UI. Currently, we use the editable root of the selection range to
    determine where in the layer tree we should start our ascent, in search of a completely transparent or
    completely clipped container.

            During EditorState computation, we use the hidden editable element heuristic to determine whether we should
            begin suppressing selection gestures and UI. Currently, we use the editable root of the selection range to
            determine where in the layer tree we should start our ascent, in search of a completely transparent or
            completely clipped container.

    Ensures that we recognize the blog editor on blog.naver.com to be a hidden editable area. This website places
    focus inside an editable body element of a subframe that is completely empty (width: 0 and border: 0). See the

    (WebCore::RenderLayer::calculateClipRects const):
    
    Source/WebKit:
    
    After r242833, we began to avoid sending redundant ElementDidFocus updates in the case where a focused element
    was blurred and refocused within the same runloop. This was done to prevent the input view from flickering due
    to input view reloading, as well as scrolling to reveal the focused element, when tapping to change selection on
    Microsoft Word online.
    
    However, on blog.naver.com, these ElementDidFocus messages were necessary in order to ensure that the platform
    input context changes when moving between the title and body fields, or when tapping to change selection. This
    is because blog.naver.com uses a hidden contenteditable area under a subframe (see WebCore ChangeLog for more
    detail here). While text is never directly inserted into this hidden contenteditable, the events are observed
    and used to "play back" editing in the main visible content area.
    
    Thus, when moving between the title and body fields (or when changing selection within either), the only hint we
    get is that the hidden editable element is blurred and immediately refocused. Since we no longer send
    ElementDidFocus updates in this scenario, UIKeyboardImpl and kbd are not aware that the page has effectively
    changed input contexts.
    
    Combined with the fact that Korean IME on iOS may insert additional text given the document context (i.e. text
    that the input manager, kbd, thinks we've previously inserted), this means that when typing several characters
    into the body field on naver and then switching to edit the title, initial keystrokes may insert unexpected
    text in the title field.
    
    To fix this, we add some hooks to notify the UI process when an element that was blurred has been immediately
    refocused. Upon receiving this message, the UI process then tells UIKeyboardImpl to re-retrieve its input
    context, which calls into -requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler: in WKContentView. While notorious
    for being synchronous IPC, this is mitigated by (1) being limiting to only instances where we have a hidden
    editable area, and (2) being limited by a batching mechanism in the web process, such that if the focused
    element is blurred, refocused, re-blurred, and refocused many times in the same runloop, we'll only send a
    single UpdateInputContextAfterBlurringAndRefocusingElement message (as opposed to the many ElementDidFocus
    messages we would've sent in previous releases).

    Tell the active UIKeyboardImpl to refetch document state from the WKContentView. While this does result in a new
    autocorrection context request (which, unfortunately, triggers synchronous IPC to the web process), this request

            Typing Korean in title field after typing in the body inserts extraneous characters on blog.naver.com
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201023
            <rdar://problem/54294794>

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            After r242833, we began to avoid sending redundant ElementDidFocus updates in the case where a focused element
            was blurred and refocused within the same runloop. This was done to prevent the input view from flickering due
            to input view reloading, as well as scrolling to reveal the focused element, when tapping to change selection on
            Microsoft Word online.

            However, on blog.naver.com, these ElementDidFocus messages were necessary in order to ensure that the platform
            input context changes when moving between the title and body fields, or when tapping to change selection. This
            is because blog.naver.com uses a hidden contenteditable area under a subframe (see WebCore ChangeLog for more
            detail here). While text is never directly inserted into this hidden contenteditable, the events are observed
            and used to "play back" editing in the main visible content area.

            Thus, when moving between the title and body fields (or when changing selection within either), the only hint we
            get is that the hidden editable element is blurred and immediately refocused. Since we no longer send
            ElementDidFocus updates in this scenario, UIKeyboardImpl and kbd are not aware that the page has effectively
            changed input contexts.

            Combined with the fact that Korean IME on iOS may insert additional text given the document context (i.e. text
            that the input manager, kbd, thinks we've previously inserted), this means that when typing several characters
            into the body field on naver and then switching to edit the title, initial keystrokes may insert unexpected
            text in the title field.

            To fix this, we add some hooks to notify the UI process when an element that was blurred has been immediately
            refocused. Upon receiving this message, the UI process then tells UIKeyboardImpl to re-retrieve its input
            context, which calls into -requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler: in WKContentView. While notorious
            for being synchronous IPC, this is mitigated by (1) being limiting to only instances where we have a hidden
            editable area, and (2) being limited by a batching mechanism in the web process, such that if the focused
            element is blurred, refocused, re-blurred, and refocused many times in the same runloop, we'll only send a
            single UpdateInputContextAfterBlurringAndRefocusingElement message (as opposed to the many ElementDidFocus
            messages we would've sent in previous releases).

            Add a new mechanism to update the platform input context (on iOS, UIKeyboardImpl's document state) when focus
            moves away from and immediately returns to a hidden editable element.

            autocorrection context request (which, unfortunately, triggers synchronous IPC to the web process), this request
            would've still happened anyways in the case where we would previously have sent an ElementDidFocus message.

            Subframes where content doesn't use any touch-action properties won't generate event region for their main layer.
            As a result the touch-action property gets computed in UI process to the parent frames touch-action (instead of 'auto').

            If the topmost layer hit is a WKChildScrollView we know its content layer didn't have an event region.
            This means we should return the default value 'auto'.

    When handling a single tap in non-editable content, keyboards logic in UIKit may attempt to wait for all
    pending tasks in UIKeyboardTaskQueue to finish executing (e.g. by calling -waitUntilAllTasksAreFinished]). If
    the task queue has a pending task at this moment - for example, a text selection update that is waiting for a
    response from the web process - this will result in a permanent deadlock, since the main thread will be blocked,
    and therefore cannot receive any IPC communication from the web process.
    
    One way to trigger this is to activate both the loupe gesture and non-editable text tap gesture simultaneously,
    by tapping in a non-editable part of the web page, while an ongoing loupe gesture is driving selection updates
    (see the layout test for more details).
    
    To avoid getting into this scenario, prevent the text tap gesture recognizer from firing in a few edge cases
    that could lead to hangs under keyboard code in UIKit. See comments below.

    Whenever WKWebView's size changes, it normally notifies the web content process by calling into WebPageProxy::
    setViewportConfigurationViewLayoutSize, which remembers this view layout size using a member variable,
    m_viewportConfigurationViewLayoutSize. Later, m_viewportConfigurationViewLayoutSize is consulted as a part of
    constructing the creation parameters used to set up a new page.
    
    However, during animated resize, WKWebView avoids these calls to setViewportConfigurationViewLayoutSize via the
    dynamic viewport update mode check in -[WKWebView _frameOrBoundsChanged]. Instead, the new view layout size is
    pushed to the web process by calling WebPageProxy::dynamicViewportSizeUpdate.
    
    Since dynamicViewportSizeUpdate doesn't update m_viewportConfigurationViewLayoutSize, the next
    WebPageCreationParameters that are created with this WebPageProxy (e.g. after a process swap, or after
    reloading, if the process was terminated) will use the size of the WKWebView prior to the most recent animated
    resize.
    
    To fix the bug, we simply make sure that m_viewportConfigurationViewLayoutSize is updated in the dynamic

    After <https://trac.webkit.org/r247656>, the -tracksImmediatelyWhileDecelerating property of WKScrollView and
    WKChildScrollView is set to NO. This means that if a user interacts with the page while the scroll view is
    decelerating (e.g. after momentum scrolling), the pan gesture recognizer will not be immediately recognized.
    This gives other gesture recognizers, such as the synthetic click (single tap) gesture a chance to instead
    recognize first. In this particular bug, this causes taps on the web view that are intended to only stop
    momentum scrolling to instead activate clickable elements beneath the touch, such as links and buttons.
    
    To mitigate this, we add some logic to prevent the click gesture recognizer from firing in the case where the
    tap also causes the scroll view to decelerate. This heuristic is similar to the one introduced in r219310, which
    has the same purpose of hiding gestures that stop momentum scrolling from the page, and also consults

    The bug was caused by a race condition between Google slides removing inputmode="none" from the hidden
    content editable and updating the focused region upon receiving a pointerup event, which happens after
    the Google slides had already updated its page layout & coordinates based on new visual viewport with
    the software keyboard's boudning rect taken into account.
    
    Delay bringing up the software keyboard for a inputmode change until all touches are released.
    
    In the future, we could consider also delaying the software keyboard to be brought in general until
    touchend / pointerup events are dispatched but this is rather risky since that could affact random
    other websites while Google suites is the only major site to make use of inputmode="none".
    
    This patch also reverts r243044, which was added for Google slides, since it's no longer needed and
    interferes with this patch by adding another way to bring up the software keyboard.
    
    Note: Adjusting touchend / pointerup coordinates while the keyboard is being brought up doesn't work

    UI process occasionally hangs in -[UIKeyboardTaskQueue lockWhenReadyForMainThread]
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200215
    <rdar://problem/52976965>
    
    Reviewed by Tim Horton.
    
    To implement autocorrection on iOS, UIKit sometimes needs to request contextual information from WebKit. This is
    handled as a sync IPC message in WebKit, since UIKit would otherwise proceed to block the main thread after
    sending the request, preventing WebKit from handling any IPC responses in the UI process (potentially resulting
    in deadlock if any other sync IPC messages were to arrive in the UI process during this time).
    
    The synchronous nature of this autocorrection request means that if any sync IPC message were to be
    simultaneously dispatched in the opposite direction (i.e. web to UI process), we need to immediately handle the
    incoming sync message in the UI process (otherwise, we'd end up deadlocking for 1 second until the
    autocorrection context request hits a 1-second IPC timeout).
    
    One such synchronous message from the web process to the UI process is WebPageProxy::CreateNewPage, triggered as
    a result of synchronously opening a new window. Due to Safari changes in iOS 13 (<rdar://problem/51755088>),
    this message now calls into code which then causes UIKit to call *back into* -[WKContentView
    requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler:] for the newly opened web view, under the scope of the call
    to -requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler: in the original web view.
    
    This caused a crash, which was tracked in <rdar://problem/52590170>. There was an attempt to fix this in r247345
    by invoking the existing handler well before storing the new one; while this avoided the crash, it didn't solve
    the root problem, which was that keyboard task queues would get into a bad state after this scenario; this would
    manifest in a UI process hang under -[UIKeyboardTaskQueue lockWhenReadyForMainThread] during the next user
    gesture, which is tracked by this bug (<rdar://problem/52976965>).
    
    As it turns out, the keyboard task queue gets into a bad state because it is architected in such a way that
    tasks added to the queue under the scope of parent task must be finished executing before their parents;
    otherwise, the call to -[UIKeyboardTaskExecutionContext returnExecutionToParentWithInfo:] never happens when
    handling the child task. This has the effect of causing the keyboard task queue to end up with a
    UIKeyboardTaskExecutionContext that can never return execution to its parent context, such that if the task
    queue is then told to wait until any future task is finished executing, it will hang forever, waiting for these
    stuck tasks to finish executing (which never happens, because they're all waiting to return execution to their
    parents which are already done executing!)
    
    To fix this hang and avoid ever getting into this bad state, we need to invoke the autocorrection request
    handlers in this order:
    
    (1) Receive outer autocorrection context request.
    (2) Receive inner autocorrection context request.
    (3) Invoke inner autocorrection context request completion handler.
    (4) Invoke outer autocorrection context request completion handler.
    
    ...instead of swapping (3) and (4), like we do currently.
    
    * UIProcess/ios/WKContentViewInteraction.mm:
    (-[WKContentView resignFirstResponderForWebView]):

            UI process occasionally hangs in -[UIKeyboardTaskQueue lockWhenReadyForMainThread]
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200215
            <rdar://problem/52976965>

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            To implement autocorrection on iOS, UIKit sometimes needs to request contextual information from WebKit. This is
            handled as a sync IPC message in WebKit, since UIKit would otherwise proceed to block the main thread after
            sending the request, preventing WebKit from handling any IPC responses in the UI process (potentially resulting
            in deadlock if any other sync IPC messages were to arrive in the UI process during this time).

            The synchronous nature of this autocorrection request means that if any sync IPC message were to be
            simultaneously dispatched in the opposite direction (i.e. web to UI process), we need to immediately handle the
            incoming sync message in the UI process (otherwise, we'd end up deadlocking for 1 second until the
            autocorrection context request hits a 1-second IPC timeout).

            One such synchronous message from the web process to the UI process is WebPageProxy::CreateNewPage, triggered as
            a result of synchronously opening a new window. Due to Safari changes in iOS 13 (<rdar://problem/51755088>),
            this message now calls into code which then causes UIKit to call *back into* -[WKContentView
            requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler:] for the newly opened web view, under the scope of the call
            to -requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler: in the original web view.

            This caused a crash, which was tracked in <rdar://problem/52590170>. There was an attempt to fix this in r247345
            by invoking the existing handler well before storing the new one; while this avoided the crash, it didn't solve
            the root problem, which was that keyboard task queues would get into a bad state after this scenario; this would
            manifest in a UI process hang under -[UIKeyboardTaskQueue lockWhenReadyForMainThread] during the next user
            gesture, which is tracked by this bug (<rdar://problem/52976965>).

            As it turns out, the keyboard task queue gets into a bad state because it is architected in such a way that
            tasks added to the queue under the scope of parent task must be finished executing before their parents;
            otherwise, the call to -[UIKeyboardTaskExecutionContext returnExecutionToParentWithInfo:] never happens when
            handling the child task. This has the effect of causing the keyboard task queue to end up with a
            UIKeyboardTaskExecutionContext that can never return execution to its parent context, such that if the task
            queue is then told to wait until any future task is finished executing, it will hang forever, waiting for these
            stuck tasks to finish executing (which never happens, because they're all waiting to return execution to their
            parents which are already done executing!)

            To fix this hang and avoid ever getting into this bad state, we need to invoke the autocorrection request
            handlers in this order:

            (1) Receive outer autocorrection context request.
            (2) Receive inner autocorrection context request.
            (3) Invoke inner autocorrection context request completion handler.
            (4) Invoke outer autocorrection context request completion handler.

            ...instead of swapping (3) and (4), like we do currently.

    Source/WebCore:
    
    Add to InteractionInformationAtPosition a ScrollingNodeID which represents the enclosing scrolling
    node that affects the targeted element's position. We use this to find a UIScrollView in the UI process.
    
    The entrypoint to finding the enclosing scrolling node is ScrollingCoordinator::scrollableContainerNodeID(),
    which calls RenderLayerCompositor::asyncScrollableContainerNodeID() to look for a scrolling ancestor in
    the current frame, and then looks for an enclosing scrollable frame, or a scrolling ancestor in
    the enclosing frame.
    
    There's a bit of subtlety in RenderLayerCompositor::asyncScrollableContainerNodeID() because if you're asking
    for the node that scrolls the renderer, if the renderer itself has a layer and is scrollable, you want
    its enclosing scroller.

        The content on this page had a scale(0) div overlaying an overflow:scroll element,
        and our UI-side hit-testing code would find this scale(0) element, because apparently
        -[UIView convertPoint:fromView:] will happily work with non-invertible matrices, and 
        -[UIView pointInside:withEvent:] just compares the point with the view bounds.

        Since the view frame takes the transform into account, we can look for an empty frame
        to detect these non-invertible transforms.

    The legacy HashMap decoder (returning a boolean) was failing to WTFMove()
    the key & value when calling HashMap::add(). The modern decoder (returning
    an Optional) was properly using WTFMove(). Rewrite the legacy HashMap decoder
    to call the modern one to reduce code duplication and to get this optimization.
    
    Also, encode HashMap::size() as a uint32_t instead of a uint64_t since
    HashMap::size() returns an 'unsigned int' type. Finally, update the modern
    decoder to WTFMove(hashMap) when returning. Because the function returns an
    Optional<HashMap> and not a HashMap, I do not believe we get return value
    optimization (RVO).

    Revert most of r247822 and use an alternative approach to address hangs. In this patch, the proposal
    is to add a SendSyncOption::ForceDispatchWhenDestinationIsWaitingForUnboundedSyncReply flag on the
    WebPage::TouchEventSync() & WebPage::GetPositionInformation() sendSync() calls in the UIProcess.
    Those will cause this IPCs to get dispatched right away in the WebContent process, even if the
    WebContent process is itself currently stuck on unbounded (i.e. potentially slow) synchronous IPC
    (JS alerts / prompts & sync XHR). Because re-entering WebCore on sync IPC is generally unsafe, this
    patch also updates the WebPage::getPositionInformation() & WebPage::touchEventSync() to return early
    (i.e. cancelled) if they get called while the WebContent process is stuck on a slow sendSync.
    
    This approach should address the UIProcess hangs caused by the WebPage::TouchEventSync() and
    WebPage::GetPositionInformation() sync IPC messages when the WebContent process is busy on a slow XHR
    or a JS prompt / alert. It should be safe because we do not re-enter WebCore. The only drawback is that
    those IPCs will be cancelled (early return with default value) when the WebContent process is busy.
    However, I am being told that this is likely acceptable in practice.

    Use new SendSyncOption::ProcessIncomingSyncMessagesWhenWaitingForSyncReply flag when sending
    the synchronous IPC for JS alerts / prompt / confirm. This allows the WebProcess to process
    incoming synchronous IPC for other processes (in particular the UIProcess) while it is blocked
    on those synchronous IPCs. It is safe to re-enter the WebContent process on these sync IPCs
    since they are triggered by JS and we return to JS right after. This should avoid UIProcess
    hangs when the UIProcess is sending a sync IPC to the WebContent process, which is itself
    stuck on the sync IPC to show a JS alert.

    Without the flag on the sendSync from the WebContent process of the
    NetworkConnectionToWebProcess::TestProcessIncomingSyncMessagesWhenWaitingForSyncReply IPC, the
    test would hang. This is because the WebContent process sends a sync IPC to the network process,
    which in turns sends one to the UIProcess, which itself sends one back to the WebContent process.
    This would attempt to re-enter the WebContent process which is currently sending a sync IPC, which
    is not allowed by default.

    Regression(r247400): Unable to log into AIB Mobile Banking App
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200094
    <rdar://problem/52519818>
    
    Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.
    
    In r247400, a change was made to only set the 'app has universal sandbox access' flag
    only when issueing the sandbox extension for / actually succeeded (it usually fails
    in practice). Previously, AIB Mobile Banking app was relying on this behavior to
    trigger a load for file:///login which is outside their container. However, now that
    the 'app has universal sandbox access' flag is no longer set, it trips our security
    checks and the load gets ignored.
    
    To address the issue, apply only the 'app has universal sandbox access' flag fix with
    a linked-on-after check.

            In r247400, a change was made to only set the 'app has universal sandbox access' flag
            only when issueing the sandbox extension for / actually succeeded (it usually fails
            in practice). Previously, AIB Mobile Banking app was relying on this behavior to
            trigger a load for file:///login which is outside their container. However, now that
            the 'app has universal sandbox access' flag is no longer set, it trips our security
            checks and the load gets ignored.

            To address the issue, apply only the 'app has universal sandbox access' flag fix with
            a linked-on-after check.

    The WebResourceLoadStatisticsStore is a main thread object. In its destructor, it was dispatching
    to the background queue to destroy the m_statisticsStore / m_persistentStorage data members, which
    live on the background queue. It would then synchronously wait for the background queue to finish
    destroying them. The idea was to guarantee that the ResourceLoadStatisticsMemoryStore and the
    ResourceLoadStatisticsPersistentStorage would never outlive the WebResourceLoadStatisticsStore,
    given that they keep a raw pointer back to the WebResourceLoadStatisticsStore (via m_store data
    member).
    
    The issue is that *while* the WebResourceLoadStatisticsStore destructor is running on the main
    thread, the background queue may be running code in ResourceLoadStatisticsMemoryStore or
    ResourceLoadStatisticsPersistentStorage which refs the WebResourceLoadStatisticsStore, even
    though its ref count has already reached 0. It is actually a common pattern in
    ResourceLoadStatisticsMemoryStore to call RunLoop::main().dispatch() and ref their m_store in
    the lambda, so that they can interact with the WebResourceLoadStatisticsStore.
    
    To address the issue, we now destroy m_statisticsStore / m_persistentStorage *before* the

        [iOS WK2] A top fixed bar can flicker when scrolling with the keyboard up

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        ScrollingTreeFrameScrollingNode::layoutViewportForScrollPosition() computes a visual viewport
        from the current scroll position and scrollableAreaSize(). This doesn't know anything about
        the impact of keyboards on the visual viewport, so it computes a too-large visual viewport
        when the keyboard is up, triggering incorrect manipulations of the layout viewport. This
        leads to the top bar flashing to position 0 when it should be hidden off the top.

        Fix by feeding into the scrolling tree the height of the visual viewport which takes
        FrameView::visualViewportOverrideRect() into account. This is stored on ScrollingStateFrameScrollingNode/
        ScrollingTreeFrameScrollingNode.

    In macOS 10.15, attempting to access ~/Library/FontCollections/ from the web process causes a Sandbox violation
    and a subsequent crash. This can be triggered by trying to show the font panel via Font > Show Fonts in the
    context menu after right clicking.
    
    In the (near) future, we should fix this by moving logic to show the font panel, color panel and styles panel
    from the Editor in the web process to the UI process in WebKit2. However, for the time being, we can just work
    around this by adding a new EditorClient hook to determine whether to allow the font panel to show; this returns
    true in the legacy macOS WebKit port, and false everywhere else.

            When we get a message notifying us that the view has been removed from the window, we unconditionally
            ask the fullscreen manager to exit fullscreen, which has the side effect (on iOS) of pausing the video
            unconditionally. Only ask the fullscreen manager to exit fullscreen if there is actually a video in

    Source/WebCore:
    
    When the page scale changes (e.g. as the result of shink to fit mode) we need to visit all the text content on the page and check whether they need to be boosted.
    Currently we call setNeedsRecalcStyleInAllFrames() to accomplish it. Unfortunatelly setNeedsRecalcStyleInAllFrames destroys all the style information which means that the
    subsequent styleResolve() needs to start from scratch.
    This patch addresses this issue by directly adjusting the computed style information when text boosting is required and schedules layout accordingly. We also trigger this style adjusting
    on a timer so that rapid dynamicViewportSizeUpdate() calls won't trigger redundant layouts.

        Sometimes the correction highlight may not hide when defocusing an editable field.
        This occurs only when a person pressed a key in a non-editable element beforehand.
        We need to reset some state to force a re-computation of whether a keyboard is still
        needed whenever an element is defocused (blurred in web paralance).

        Following r241734 both editable and non-editable key events are handled using the same
        code path. This is accomplished by having WKContentView's -_requiresKeyboardWhenFirstResponder
        return YES to tell UIKit it needs a keyboard even when there is no editable element focused.
        As a result UIKit retains all the keyboard state, including keeping the correction highlight
        visible. Prior to r241734 WKContentView's -_requiresKeyboardWhenFirstResponder would not return
        YES when a non-editable element was focused and hence UIKit would tear down the keyboard
        and its state, including the correction highlight. In r245154, we made keyboard instantiate
        for a focused non-editable element lazy as a performance optimization. Although r245154
        kept the r241734 behavior (just made it lazy) it re-wrote the code in such a way that we
        can utilize it as a hook to fix this bug. In particular, we now clear the bit about a
        seen keydown in a non-editable element whenever we are defocusing an editable element
        before we reload the input views, as part of hiding the keyboard. On the reload, UIKit
        will call -_requiresKeyboardWhenFirstResponder, WebKit will respond with NO now that
        a non-editable element is focused and hence UIKit will do what it did pre r241734: tear
        down the keyboard.

        around across reloads and not doing so will reduce our memory footprint.

    When switching between focused form fields, we hide the keyboard for the previous focused element prior to
    showing the keyboard for the newly focused element. This means that we will actually dismiss the keyboard in the
    process of changing the focused element, which posts keyboard geometry notifications, which causes us to scroll
    WKScrollView.
    
    On iOS 12, this would be immediately followed by re-presenting the keyboard for the new focused element, which
    causes us to adjust the scroll view back to its original position right away; this means that the scrolling that
    happens as a result of adjusting for the keyboard insets after dismissal doesn't result in any visible change.
    
    However, on iOS 13, after r239441 and r244546, we now defer scrolling and zooming to reveal the focused element
    until later; this means the scrolling that happens as a result of initially dismissing the keyboard now causes a
    consistent jump in the scroll view's scroll position (whereas on iOS 12, this only happens rarely, and the jump
    is also less noticeable).
    
    To mitigate this, we detect the case where we're moving focus from one element to another; if we're about to
    show a keyboard for the newly focused element, then we should avoid scrolling as a result of the impending
    "keyboard will hide" notification.

    1. The keyboard gets dismissed as the result of scroll event.
    2. The (horizontal)scroll event is initiated by WebKit as we try to re-center the content.
    3. The content gets off-centered as the result of the newly constructed drop-down menu which slightly sticks out of the document to the right (layout overflows).
    
    It works with shipping version of iOS because _zoomToFocusRect operates on stale viewport information (see r244494 for the progression).

            Apply the fix from r193481 to WKSystemPreviewView as well, having it
            become a WKApplicationStateTrackingView and plumbing that through
            to our is-background machinery.

            We really, really should instead have WKWebView itself be the application
            state tracking view, but that is a bigger change (and has some implications
            for full-screen video and whatnot).

    Prewarm local storage in the NetworkProcess to reduce WebContent process hangs
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199879
    <rdar://problem/53217757>
    
    Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.
    
    Source/WebCore:
    
    When JS accesses window.localStorage for the first time, we end up doing a
    synchronous IPC to the network process to pull in all items in the local
    storage for the origin. If the network process does not have this data in
    memory, it has to read it from a database on disk, which may take a significant
    amount of time and hang the WebContent process during this time.
    
    To alleviate this problem, this patch introduces prewarming on the local storage
    in the network process when loading a given origin in the WebContent process.
    This way, in most cases, when the JS accesses window.localStorage for the first
    time, the synchronous IPC to the network process returns much faster (measured
    50-100ms for a very large database, down from 250-300ms), as it only needs to
    IPC the data over, without the need to fetch it from disk.
    
    As a safety net to avoid excessive prewarming, we currently prewarm at most 5
    security origins per page load.

    Typing into a cell in a Google Sheet lags behind by one character
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199587
    <rdar://problem/51616845>
    
    Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.
    
    Source/WebCore:
    
    Add a Google Sheets quirk. Put all DOM timers scheduled from keydown and keypress event listeners
    into a holding tank. The timers continue to tick, but are barred from executing their action until
    the next text insertion or deletion or 32 ms (on device) have elapsed, whichever is sooner. We only
    allocate a holding tank once per document, only if the quirk is active, and this allocation is done
    when the document schedules a timer on keydown or keypress. The holding tank lives for the lifetime
    of the document.
    
    The story behind the quirk:
    
    On keypress Google Sheets schedules timers and expects that a DOM update will occur (i.e. text
    will be inserted or deleted) within the same event loop iteration as the dispatched keypress. The
    UI Events spec. [1] makes no such guarantee of when a DOM update must occur in relation to the keypress
    event. It could happen in the same event loop iteration as the key press (as Google expects), the
    next iteration, 500ms later, 2 minutes later, etc. What the spec does guarantee is that by the time
    a DOM input event is dispatched that the DOM will be updated. And this is the solution to the problem
    Google Sheets is trying to solve, but is doing so using pre-IE 9 technology (though similar
    functionality was available via onpropertychange in IE < 9).
    
    See also <https://github.com/w3c/uievents/issues/238>, which is tracking a spec. text update for
    this quirk.

    shot timer then schedule it for the next event loop iteration. If it's a repeating timer just
    let it continue ticking. Otherwise, do what we no now and execute the timer's action. The reason
    we do not suspend timers in the holding tank is because:
        1. Far out timers (Google Sheets registers timers as far out as 5 minutes!) are not penalized.
        Though smart supension logic could avoid this. See (3).
    
        2. Empirical observations indicate that the keyboard will perform the insertion or deletion
        reasonably quickly (not the same event loop iteration as the keydown, but within two iterations out).
        So, the timers in the holding tank are short-lived.
    
        3. Simplifies the code. There is no need to keep additional bookkeeping to track multiple timer
        suspension reasons (timers currently can only have one suspension reason) or alternatively defer
        scheduling a timer until a later time and computing a new "fair" firing time when scheduled.

    [iOS] Option + Up or Down Arrow key doesn’t move cursor past paragraph boundaries in WebKit2
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199851
    
    Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.
    
    Source/WebKit:
    
    The bug was caused by the difference in the way AppKit and UIKit responds to Option + Up / Down.
    
    On macOS, AppKit sends moveForward before sending moveToStartOfParagraph and moveBackward
    before sending moveToEndOfParagraph. As a result, when Option + Down is pressed when we are at
    the end of a line, we would first move to the beginning of the next line (i.e. after the line break)
    before moving or extending selection with the paragraph boundary granurality.
    
    On iOS, UIKit only calls _moveToStartOfParagraph without moving forward by a character. As a result,
    moving forward by the paragraph boundary granurality immediately stops when we're starting at the
    end of a line when Option + Down is pressed. Option + Up case is similar.
    
    Fix the bug on iOS by emulating what happens on macOS. Namely, move the selection forward or backward
    by the character granurality before moving by the paragraph boundary granurality.

    Messages to WorkQueueMessageReceivers are normally dispatched from the IPC WorkQueue. However, there is a race if
    a client (here StorageManager) adds itself as a WorkQueueMessageReceiver as a result of receiving an IPC message
    on the main thread (here NetworkConnectionToWebProcess::WebPageWasAdded).
    The message might have already been dispatched from the IPC WorkQueue to the main thread by the time the
    client registers itself as a WorkQueueMessageReceiver. To address this, we check again for messages receivers
    once the message arrives on the main thread.

            Messages to WorkQueueMessageReceivers are normally dispatched from the IPC WorkQueue. However, there is a race if
            a client (here StorageManager) adds itself as a WorkQueueMessageReceiver as a result of receiving an IPC message
            on the main thread (here NetworkConnectionToWebProcess::WebPageWasAdded).
            The message might have already been dispatched from the IPC WorkQueue to the main thread by the time the
            client registers itself as a WorkQueueMessageReceiver. To address this, we check again for messages receivers
            once the message arrives on the main thread.

    [macOS 10.15] Cannot unbold selected text when the system font is used

    In macOS 10.15, +[NSFont fontWithName:size:] no longer recognizes system fonts (of name
    ".SFNS-*") and returns nil instead. However, our existing implementation of
    WebPageProxy::fontAtSelection works by grabbing the font name in the web process, and
    sending it over to the UI process, where it is mapped to an NSFont. As a result, this always
    results in a nil font in macOS 10.15, which causes us to never update NSFontManager's
    selected font. In turn, this means that once selected text is bolded, it can't be unbolded
    via NSFontManager, since NSFontManager thinks that the text is still not bold.
    
    To fix this, we simply encode and send a platform FontInfo instead of sending the font name.
    This allows the UI process to reconstruct NSFonts from font attribute dictionaries instead,

    This patch adds support for -apple-system-ui-serif, -apple-system-ui-monospaced,
    and -apple-system-ui-rounded, behind an SPI that is off-by-default. We don't want
    to expose these fonts to the web because we don't a standardization story for them
    yet, but we do want some apps to be able to use them.
    
    WebKit clients who want to use these fonts can set
    -[WKPreferences _shouldAllowDesignSystemUIFonts] = YES.
    
    The patch generalizes our existing system-ui infrastructure to handle these three
    additional fonts. It also explicitly disables the unsupported dot-prefixed names
    so they don't leak out into Web content.

        [Cocoa] -loadFileURL:allowingReadAccessToURL: should fully resolve file URLs

        <rdar://problem/52002206>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        -loadFileURL:allowingReadAccessToURL: used -_web_originalDataAsWTFString from WKNSURLExtras
        to convert the file and read access NSURLs to strings, which under the hood calls
        CFURLGetBytes(). CFURLGetBytes() gets the URL's string without considering the base URL, so
        if the client creates a URL like this:

            NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"tmpfile.txt" relativeToURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/tmp"]]

        ... then -_web_originalDataAsWTFString will merely return the string "tmpfile.txt". When
        that is later converted back to a URL in WebPageProxy::loadFile(), we lose track of the base
        component and refuse to load something that no longer looks like a file: URL.

        Fixed this by fully resolving the URLs passed to -loadFileURL:allowingReadAccessToURL: when
        converting to strings by using -[NSURL absoluteString] instead of -_web_originalDataAsWTFString.

        If the client asks us to load a file URL but does not provide a resource path, WebKit
        would fallback to issuing a sandbox extension for /. This no longer works on mac OS

        To address the issue, if the attempt to create a sandbox extension for / fails, we now

        Coverity is complaining here about copying PageState by value in the parameter list. It's
        sort of a false positive, in that the PageState really does need to be copied here, so this
        is the best we can do. But pass by value and then WTFMove() is a pretty strange way to write
        it. Passing by rvalue reference would be better. This makes the copy more clear.

        [iOS WK2] Can't place caret or select in content that overflows a contenteditable element

        Various code paths for editing used renderer->absoluteBoundingBoxRect(), which is the border
        box of the element (or a set of line boxes for inline elements) converted to absolute
        coordinates. This excludes overflow content, but contenteditable needs to be able to
        place the caret in overflow content, and allow selection rects to be in the overflow area
        (if the element has visible overflow).

        Try to clean this up by adding some static helpers on WebPage for accessing the relevant
        rects, and use them in code call from visiblePositionInFocusedNodeForPoint(), and
        code that is input to selectionClipRect.

        This changes selectionClipRect to use the padding box (excluding borders), which is a progression.

        Mitigates a crash wherein we end up calling the completion handler of
        -requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler: within a nested call
        to -requestAutocorrectionContextWithCompletionHandler:. In this particular
        case, a sync `window.open` from the web process to the UI process happens
        while the UI process is already handling a sync autocorrection context
        request. This causes the UI process to try and immediately dispatch the
        incoming sync message to avoid deadlock. However, Safari's logic to create
        and set up a new web view when opening a new window makes the new view the
        first responder, which then prompts UIKit logic to request an autocorrection
        context for the new web view.

        To avoid the issue for now, simply use -resignFirstResponder as a cue to invoke
        pending autocorrection context handlers in the original web view before UIKit
        tries to request autocorrection context in the newly created view.

        I attempted to write a test for this, but realized that we only end up hitting
        the debug assertion pointed out in <https://webkit.org/b/199680>; we should be
        able to write a test for this in the future, if we teach Connection to handle
        multiple outgoing sync messages.

        The UIContextMenuInteraction calls didEndInteraction before executing the

        Rather than ask for UIKit to change, I'm just starting the interaction again

        IPC::Connection::waitForMessage() is crashing due to a null defererence of
        m_waitingForMessage. Since m_waitingForMessage is only ever set to null in
        waitForMessage(), this seems to imply we've re-entered waitForMessage().
        This is in theory possible since the loop inside waitForMessage() calls
        SyncMessageState::singleton().dispatchMessages() on every iteration to
        process incoming synchronous IPC messages. In theory, one of these sync
        IPC messages could run code which ends up calling waitForAndDispatchImmediately()
        (and thus waitForMessage()).

        We had a debug assertion to try and catch re-entrancy with a comment stating
        "We don't support having multiple clients waiting for messages." but we
        would not see those in release and we would crash with a null dereference
        instead.

        To address the crashes in release, return early in case of re-entrancy
        (we would still hit an assertion in debug).

        [Pointer Events] Scroll indicators should not show for scrollable content with touch-action: none
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199618

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Even though we correctly didn't scroll when "touch-action: none" was specified on an element, we would only apply
        scrolling constraints after the panning gesture was recognized and the backing UIScrollView would show its scroll
        indicators. While this is correct when only "pan-x" or "pan-y" is specified, we should not show the scroll indicators
        at all for "touch-action: none" since no scrolling should happen.

        To do this, we add a new method to the WKTouchActionGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol to indicate whether a given
        gesture recognizer may pan content in the WKWebView. If the gesture recognizer is the top-level scroll view or one
        created within the page to back "overflow: scroll" content or an iframe, we correctly make that gesture recognizer
        fail to recognize if neither "pan-x" nor "pan-y" is specified for this touch identifier.

        Currently, the shrink-to-fit-content heuristic added to scale desktop sites fit within the viewport on iPadOS

        may cause a visible jump, as rendering may commence well before the document is finished parsing.

        To mitigate this, we move the first opportunity for the shrink-to-fit heuristic from after document, to right

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199543

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We used to set the "enabled" property on the main UIScrollView's UIPinchGestureRecognizer to disable pinch-to-zoom
        behavior based on the "touch-action" CSS property. This was sub-optimal since this gesture recognizer can be publicly
        accessible by third-party developers, but also because it set state instead of a run-time solution.

        We now introduce a new WKTouchActionGestureRecognizer dedicated to preventing clearly identified gesture recognizers
        from being recognized to disable some built-in behavior. As a new touch starts, we record the computed touch-action
        property for the given touch identifier on the WKTouchActionGestureRecognizer, then WKTouchActionGestureRecognizer
        determines, by implementing -[canPreventGestureRecognizer:], whether the possibly-prevented gesture recognizer
        is known to lead to a pinch-to-zoom behavior and whether it contains a touch that should prevent it.

        To support the WKTouchActionGestureRecognizer, WKContentViewInteraction implements the new WKTouchActionGestureRecognizerDelegate
        protocol to indicate whether the possibly-prevented gesture recognizer is the main UIScrollView's UIPinchGestureRecognizer.

        No new test since this changes the implementation of existing behavior.

        [iOS] Crash in WebKit::WebPage::positionInformation via Range::startPosition
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199503

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        The crash was caused because focusedElementPositionInformation asssumes Editor::compositionRange is not null
        whenever Editor::hasComposition returns true, which is not necessary the case when Editor::m_compositionNode
        contains no text (data is of length 0).

        Fixed the crash by adding an early return for when Editor::compositionRange returns nullptr.

        Apparently it's a common practice to put transparent elements over visible click targets (button like divs) and use the invisible
        elements to catch the user input (e.g. Facebook's Photo/Video button).
        This patch modifies the original "do not trigger click on invisible targets" heuristic to a more restrictive "do not trigger
        click if the click target was previously hidden and became visible through touch start".
        If this still breaks some use cases, we could turn it into YouTube quirk.

        Click events on outer page are not being dispatched correctly after touch-zooming within an iframe
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185001
        <rdar://problem/40569615>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Mitigations introduced in r227759 prevent a touch inside a document of origin A to result in a click event being
        dispatched on an element inside a document of origin B. It accomplishes this by keeping track of the security
        origin of the last touch via m_potentialTapSecurityOrigin on WebPage. However, there exists a corner case in
        which m_potentialTapSecurityOrigin, set after touching a document in a subframe, may persist even after the user
        has finished interacting, causing taps in subsequent documents to not result in synthetic click events due to
        mismatched potential tap origins.

        This may happen if the first user gesture happens inside an element in a subframe with touch event handlers, but
        no click event handler (and the touch is additionally not over some clickable element). In this case,
        m_potentialTapNode is set to null in WebPage::potentialTapAtPosition, and when we consult it in
        WebPage::commitPotentialTap, we just end up calling commitPotentialTapFailed(); and return early. This means
        that m_potentialTapNode, m_potentialTapLocation, and (importantly) m_potentialTapSecurityOrigin are not reset.
        This causes subsequent taps in the top-level document to never dispatch click events, if the security origin
        does not match with that of the subframe.

        To fix this, we add a new async IPC message from the UI process to the web process to ensure that our current
        security origin is reset before attempting to handle a tap.

        Touching media controls sometimes shows software keyboard
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199490
        <rdar://problem/52076270>

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        In r243044, we added a compatibility hack for Google Slides (and other G-suite properties) to allow the on-
        screen keyboard to show up after a prevented touch event in the case where an element was already focused, even
        if the touch event handler doesn't explicitly refocus the element. However, this means that if a regular text
        field (or other form control) has been programmatically focused, then interacting with any other element that
        prevents default on touchstart will cause us to show the keyboard for that focused element.

        To mitigate this, only fall down this refocusing codepath in the case where the focused element is a hidden
        editable element (in the style of many Google productivity web apps). For non-hidden editable elements that are
        already focused, this refocusing logic is not necessary, since the user should be able to interact with the
        control to show the keyboard anyways; for hidden editable areas, this compatibility hack is actually needed,
        since there is typically no other way for a user to focus these elements and show an on-screen keyboard.

        Simplify logic that handles registering WebProcessProxy objects with their WebsiteDataStore to make
        it more maintainable and less error-prone (avoid bugs like <rdar://problem/51899751>).

        The following changes were made:
        1. The WebProcess now registers / unregisters itself directly with its WebsiteDataStore when needed,
           instead of having the WebPageProxy/ProvisionalPageProxy be in charge of calling the right
           WebProcessLifetimeTracker / WebProcessLifetimeObserver abstractions.
        2. The WebProcessLifetimeTracker / WebProcessLifetimeObserver abstractions were dropped. The
           WebsiteDataStore was the only observer.
        3. The WebProcessProxy is now registered with its WebsiteDataStore as soon as it has a page (provisional
           or not) instead of waiting until the process has finished launching. This simplifies the logic a
           lot and waiting until the process has launched is not needed by the WebsiteDataStore.

        There's a fixed, 32ms window for observing content changes after the tap is committed. r244356 introduced the fast-click behavior on form elements by omitting this fixed window and
        dispatch the synthetic click on the target node.
        This patch preserves the fast-click behavior, but now we stay at hover if the mouseMove event triggers a synchronous actionable visiblity change (as opposed to always proceed with click).

        [GTK][WPE] Remove Flatpak sandbox

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        The flatpak-spawn based sandbox was only a proof of concept and
        lacks flexibility for our needs so we ended up using it with very
        permissive permissions and it still imposed limitations that our main
        bubblewrap sandbox didn't have.

        So in order to get as many applications using the sandbox as possible we
        will just remove this for now and focus on bubblewrap. At some point
        it may be possible to improve flatpak-spawn to fit our needs.

        to make sure that the sessionID used as key is always valid. I have also added if checks to avoid crashing in
        release whenever possible.

        Note that we came to a similar conclusion for NetworkProcess::m_swServers when investigating rdar://problem/51859081,
        so the two radars are potentially related. Both HashMaps are owned by the NetworkProcess and use a SessionID

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r246757 removed logic in selectionPositionInformation responsible for setting the focused frame when handling a
        position information request. As the FIXME formerly in InteractionInformationRequest.h alluded to, text
        selection gestures on iOS were dependent on this behavior when selecting text in subframes, since text selection
        helpers in WebPageIOS.mm assume that the focused frame already contains the selection being set.

        Rather than calling setFocusedFrame when requesting position information, we can fix this by making
        WebPage::selectWithGesture and WebPage::selectTextWithGranularityAtPoint both set the focused frame if needed
        before extending or moving text selections.

        iOS: REGRESSION(async scroll): Caret doesn't scroll when scrolling textarea
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198217
        <rdar://problem/51097296>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        In iOS 12, when scrolling a text selection in an fast-scrolling container, editor state updates are scheduled
        under AsyncScrollingCoordinator::updateScrollPositionAfterAsyncScroll after the end of the scrolling gesture,
        when the scrolling layer action is ScrollingLayerPositionAction::Set. This is no longer the case in iOS 13,
        because we now bail in ScrollingTreeScrollingNode::wasScrolledByDelegatedScrolling after scroll deceleration
        finishes since the scroll position didn't end up changing. Additionally, we no longer use
        ScrollingLayerPositionAction::Set in the case where scrolling finished decelerating, since
        ScrollingTreeScrollingNodeDelegateIOS::scrollViewDidScroll no longer uses to value of inUserInteraction to
        determine whether to Set or Sync scrolling layer positions.

        To restore iOS 12 behavior, ensure that we send a scrolling tree update using ScrollingLayerPositionAction::Set
        after scrolling ends.

        <rdar://problem/52292137>

        Reviewed by Megan Gardner.

        When reloading input views under -_elementDidFocus:, -_selectionClipRect returns the value of the previously
        focused element; this is because _selectionClipRect depends on EditorState's post layout data, which is only
        guaranteed to arrive during the next remote layer tree commit after the element is focused.

        However, some clients need to inspect this value under the call to -reloadInputViews when an element is focused;
        to make this work, simply check whether we are currently waiting for post-layout EditorState data to arrive
        following element focus; if so, return the FocusedElementInformation's elementRect, which represents the initial
        state of the focused element. Otherwise, use the EditorState's post layout data, which is guaranteed to be more
        up-to-date than the FocusedElementInformation's element rect.

        perform the "select all". Moreover, since UIKit has no other means to handle this key command
        itself it tells WebKit the key command was not handled. So, WebKit tells the keyboard to insert
        the "a". Instead, WebKit should tell UIKit it can handle a "select all" even when this is an
        existing range selection. However we need to keep the current logic just for when UIKit is
        asking us with respect to populating the callout menu to not regress platform behavior.

        [iOS] Stop using cached UITargetedPreviews from previous interactions when starting a new context menu interaction
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199285
        <rdar://problem/52074916>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        WKContentView was caching the UITargetedPreview created in
        -contextMenuInteraction:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration: for later reuse by
        -contextMenuInteraction:previewForDismissingMenuWithConfiguration:. The cached value was
        then cleared in -contextMenuInteractionDidEnd:.

        This was wrong, because -contextMenuInteractionDidEnd: can be called before
        -contextMenuInteraction:previewForDismissingMenuWithConfiguration:, so we would clear the
        cache then create and cache a new UITargetedPreview during dismissal. Then when a new
        context menu interaction started, we'd reuse the targeted preview created for the previous
        dismissal (which has the wrong geometry).

        Stop assuming an ordering between
        -contextMenuInteraction:previewForDismissingMenuWithConfiguration: and
        -contextMenuInteractionDidEnd:. Instead, always create and cache a new UITargetedPreview in
        -contextMenuInteraction:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration:, then reuse it and
        clear the cache in -contextMenuInteraction:previewForDismissingMenuWithConfiguration:.

        Regression(r246526): StorageManager thread hangs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199278
        <rdar://problem/52202948>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        r246526 adds a lock m_localStorageNamespacesMutex to protect m_localStorageNamespaces, because 
        m_localStorageNamespaces is destroyed at main thread while accesses to m_localStorageNamespaces happen in the 
        background thread.
        After r246526, getOrCreateLocalStorageNamespace acquires lock m_localStorageNamespacesMutex when 
        m_localStorageNamespacesMutex is already acquired in cloneSessionStorageNamespace, so the StorageManager thread
        hangs.
        To solve this issue, we can remove the lock in getOrCreateLocalStorageNamespace, or we can remove the 
        m_localStorageNamespacesMutex. waitUntilWritesFinished() before ~StorageManager() already guarantees nothing 
        will be running in the background thread, so it is unlikely we the access to m_localStorageNamespaces in the 
        background thread would collide with the destruction of m_localStorageNamespaces. Also, we don't need 
        didDestroyStorageArea as LocalStorageNamespace can hold the last reference of StorageArea after r245881.

        The fall back to web path mechanism in SubFrameSOAuthorizationSession doesn't actually resume
        the previous navigation. Instead it starts a new one. The current implementation doesn't carry
        any information from the previous navigation. It is problematic when it comes to http referrer
        as the server might use that to determine what kind of responses to send back. Therefore, we
        add that information now.

        To accomplish the above, the patch teaches WebFrameProxy::loadURL to carry referrer information
        when it is available. Then SubFrameSOAuthorizationSession can reuses the referrer from the
        original request.

        Currently, the heuristic to determine whether the page should be shrunk to fit the content width after loading
        works by checking whether the page's content is wider than the layout width we've provided for the page.
        However, in the case where an explicit width larger than the true view width is specified by the page's meta
        viewport, we'll end up believing that the page's content is not wider than the layout width, which is dictated
        by the fixed meta viewport width. Instead, we can shrink the page down in this scenario by comparing the content
        width against the scaled size of the view when computing the amount of horizontal overflow.

        This patch implements a new SPI to inform clients about incoming AppSSO interceptions during

        m_focusedElement != &element in WebPage::elementDidBlur() sometimes

        This can happen when the focused editable element is inside a nested frame and a person
        taps outside that frame. For reasons that seem lost to time, WebKit2 on iOS would mutate
        the focused frame whenever computing selection positioning information (say, for a tap).
        This "quirk" was added in r163476, but that code has go through multiple iterations and
        is no longer comparable to the current code. Yet, the original mutation of the focused
        frame remained. As a result the UI process and Web process go out of sync with respect
        to what each thinks is the focused element and this visually manifest itself in at least
        two ways:

            1. A non-sensical DOM focus event would be dispatched at the frame tapped, but
            we would keep the focused element focused.

            2. Because we would keep the focused element focused in (1), even though its frame
            is not focused, the keyboard would be active (software keyboard on screen or candidate bar
            on screen if a hardware keyboard is attached), but appear unresponsive: any keys pressed
            would not cause text to be typed into the editable field.

        Because of (1) it was possible for m_focusedElement != &element in WebPage::elementDidBlur().
        When this happens the UI process would never receive an ElementDidBlur message and hence would
        not clear out the focused element state and hide the keyboard.

        We neither do this frame focus mutation in Legacy WebKit on iOS nor Mac. Let's remove this quirk.
        If it turns out that it causes a compatibility issue then we will be in a better position to
        understand its purpose and consider bringing this quirk back, if needed.

        the legacy API.

        In the future we should always have no margin in our indicator, and just
        apply it in whatever consumes the indicator, so that there is no
        disagreement between clients about the size of the margin.

        WKPasswordView.mm is used on iOS-family devices. However, it doesn't
        build on tvOS or watchOS when "treat deprecation warnings as errors"
        is enabled. This build failure is due to a reference to
        UIColor.groupTableViewBackgroundColor in a branch of non-dark-mode
        code. Address this by surrounding the reference with
        ALLOW_DEPRECATED_DECLARATIONS_* macros.

        Attempting to address the build failure by unconditionally enabling
        the dark-mode code works for tvOS, but fails for watchOS due to lack
        of dark-mode support on that platform.

        In -contextMenuInteraction:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration: and friend, we
        should always return a non-nil UITargetedPreview. When we do return nil, UIKit uses the web
        view itself as the snapshot view, creating an unsightly animation.

        For cases where we fail to create a UITargetedPreview from the information in
        InteractionInformationAtPosition, this patch falls back to creating a UITargetedPreview with
        a snapshot view obtained from
        -[UIView resizableSnapshotViewFromRect:afterScreenUpdates:withCapInsets:].

        Also renamed -targetedPreview to -_ensureTargetedPreview and cached the UITargetedPreview
        for reuse in -contextMenuInteraction:previewForDismissingMenuWithConfiguration:.

        When the timer fires to approximate the download rate, add a new timestamp with 0 bytes received since the last time we received bytes.
        Then, if there's only one timestamp, assume the throughput rate is 0 instead of infinite.
        This will prevent false positives estimating large download rates based on old data when the throughput drops to 0.

        When WebProcessProxy is in WebProcessCache or is pre-warmed, it does not hold a strong reference of 
        WebProcessPool. In this case, we should not store the raw pointer of WebProcessPool and perform websiteDataStore
        operations with it.
        This patch should fix the crash at dereferencing null pointer of WebProcessPool in 
        WebsiteDataStore::processPools, but it is unclear why websiteDataStore comes to observe cached or prewarmed web 
        process that should not have web page. The release log may help us find the cause.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        After r242686, in local builds, the XPC service executables run from their location at the
        top of the built products directory, rather than inside the framework.

          DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for the new location in the built products
          directory. Also removed WK_XPC_SERVICE_INSERT_LIBRARIES_DIR that had been unused.

        * WebKit.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Made the creation of symbolic links inside the
          framework’s XPCServices directory predicated on whether this is an install build, rather
          than on the build configuration, for consistency with the condition used in the .xcconfig.

        Ensure ITP state is relayed to Network Process on restart

        <rdar://problem/51646944>

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        Now that the ITP state is maintained in the Network Process, we have to make sure that we update
        that process with current ITP state if the Network Process crashes and is relaunched. This wasn't a
        problem in earlier releases because we tracked all ITP state in the UIProcess.

        This patch does the following:
        1. Add a new method to WKWebsiteDataStore to allow us to trigger statistics processing, which has the
           side effect of syncing ITP state persistently so that it will be available after bouncing the process.
        2. Adds a new test that sets a tracking domain, bounces the process, and confirms the state is still
           consistent.

        waitForNavigationToComplete may be called before WebPageProxy knows it's loading
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198741
        <rdar://problem/31164316>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        There's a potential race in `WebAutomationSession::waitForNavigationToCompleteOnPage` when
        querying for the `WebPageProxy`'s loading state (via `PageLoadingState::isLoading`), in that
        a pending load may be committed _after_ the `WebAutomationSession` checks it's value. This
        makes the automation session think that it isn't loading, so it will continue running
        commands, which can lead to a JavaScript error ("Callback was not called before the unload
        event") as any injected scripts will be cleared by the impending navigation, leaving the
        script evaluation callbacks "dangling".

        Expose more information from `PageLoadState` about whether it thinks there _may_ be a
        navigation currently happening, which the `WebAutomationSession` can use to delay commands.

        In the best case, no navigations are "missed".

        In the worst case, the automation session will wait `pageLoadTimeout` before continuing.

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        NetworkProcess currently instructs UIProcess whether a given WebProcess is doing upload.
        There is no guarantee though that the WebProcessProxy is still there when the IPC is arriving at UIProcess.
        Instead, let WebProcess handles its upload state and notify WebProcessPool about its state.
        Make sure WebProcessProxy unregisters itself in case of crash.
        In case of NetworkProcess crash, WebProcesses will see all their uploads fail
        and will notify automatically UIProcess to update their state.

        Since the processID given to WebProcessPool is coming from IPC, we cannot not trust it.
        Add early return in case of not finding a WebProcessProxy for WebProcessPool clear/set methods.

        This is a race condition that when a new request comes in the middle between the previous one finishes and the clearStateAsync is queued in the main thread.
        Therefore, when the new request starts discovery, it will still see previous request's state.

        To fix this issue, clearState() will be called unconditionally for every request. And a guard is added to clearState() to prevent double clearance.

        Reviewed by Brian Weinstein.

        It's possible that an active session is aborted before the completion handler passed to
        platformShowPaymentUI() has executed. When that happens, m_state will be Idle even though we
        assert that it is Activating. Fix this by returning early in the platformShowPaymentUI()
        completion handler when m_state is Idle.

        It's not possible to write a layout test for this because MockPaymentCoordinator handles
        showing payment UI directly in the web process, so this code is not executed in layout
        tests. The assertion can be reproduced manually by loading
        https://w3c-test.org/payment-request/payment-is-showing.https.html and clicking the button.

        When there is no process pool, we store cookies set in memory with HashSet m_pendingCookies of WebsiteDataStore.

        HashSet does not contain duplicate Cookies that are completely identical, but it may contain Cookies that have 
        all the other properties identical other than value. This is not correct because Cookies with same name, domain
        and path should be treated as the same cookie. When a cookie is set via API, we should either insert the 
        cookie into m_pendingCookies if the cookie does not exist, or update the cookie value if it already exists.

        Note that we still use HashSet with CookieHash for m_pendingCookies because in cookie deletion, we only delete 
        cookie when there is a complete match. If some cookie from m_pendingCookies has all other properties the same as
        the cookie specified in the deletion function, but the value is different, it will not be removed.

        We now set a new allowsFastClicksEverywhere property on the WebPageProxy when the content mode changes, set to true
        when we're in desktop browsing mode. We now check on this property to opt into the fast clicks everywhere behavior.

        This patch had been reverted once because it yielded some regressions in existing tests, notably under
        fast/events/touch/ios/content-observation. This updated patch addresses this by ensuring the gesture recognizers
        used for double-tap-to-zoom are disabled in -[WKContentViewInteraction _didStartProvisionalLoadForMainFrame]
        to ensure that two tests dispatching a tap at the same location don't yield the recognition of a double-tap
        rathern than the recognition of two single taps.

        This is another regression of delaying the web process launch until the first load. If the session is restored
        before anything has been loaded, which is the normal way, the RestoreSession message is just ignored and the
        state is sent to the WebPage on creation via creation parameters. The WebPage considers that restoring a session
        from creation parameters only happens when re-launching a process after a crash or in case of process swap. In
        those cases, the history item is not marked as restored from session. We need to ensure the session is restored
        in the web process from the IPC message handler, by launching the initial process before the session is
        restored.

        UIWebView dequeues it on the WebThread.

        No test because this crash depends on mixing WKWebView and UIWebView and

        (WebKit::RemoteLayerTreeDrawingAreaProxy::commitLayerTree):

        Remove viewportChangedViaDelegatedScrolling call as we were just relying on its side effect of (partially) applying
        the scrolling tree. Instead call the new applyScrollingTreeLayerPositionsAfterCommit() unconditionally.
        It only does work if there are local deltas to apply.

        Local deltas will potentially need to be applied in non-fixed cases too and it is hard to reason about the conditions.

        [Cocoa] REGRESSION(r244182): Inspector thinks CA commits can be nested

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Call InspectorController::willComposite() from the CA preCommit handler
        similar to the call to InspectorController::didComposite() in the CA
        postCommit handler. Ensure these calls will be once for nested commits.
