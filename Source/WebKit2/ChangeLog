        [GTK] Should check if a plugin mixes GTK+ symbols earlier

        We are currently checking if the plugin module and the plugin
        process mix GTK symbols after the plugin has been loaded and
        initialized. This is too late in many cases, since plugins can use
        GTK methods in the NP_Initialize implementation. This is causing
        the apps using WebKitGTK+ 2.4 to freeze when the plugin process
        scans the plugins and there's a plugin using GTK+3 installed. We
        should move the check earlier, once the module is loaded but
        before calling NP_Initialize.

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        In some cases when the socket event source is cancelled the socket
        event source callback is called with the condition of the previous
        poll instead of 0. This can happen sometimes when the source is
        cancelled from the socket event source callback. Once the socket
        event source is cancelled, it's dispatched by glib without
        polling, so the condition is never reset again and the callback is
        called again and again with the previous condition. When the
        condition is G_IO_IN, the source is re-scheduled entering into an
        infinite loop. We should always check if the source has been
        cancelled at the beginning of the callback to destroy the source
        instead of relying on the condition being 0.

        about is probably MessageSender::messageSenderDestinationID() used

        When printing synchronously in GTK+ we need to make sure that we

        the list of printers is done synchronously by GTK+, but using a
        nested main loop that might process IPC messages comming from the
        UI process like EndPrinting. When the EndPrinting message is
        received while the printer list is being populated, the print
        operation is finished unexpectely and the web process crashes. The
        PrinterListGtk class gets the list of printers in the constructor
        so we just need to ensure there's an instance alive during the
        synchronous print operation. In case of asynchronous printing the
        printer list will be created during the print operation without

        We are currently writing the downloads directly into the

        destination has been decided, the partial file is left on the
        disk. Deleting the final file is not safe because there might be a
        race condition, so we can use an intermediate file like other
        browsers do, a file in the same directory than the target
        destination but with .wkdownload suffix, that is removed when the
        download fails or is cancelled. If the download finishes

        The problem is that when the blank.ico resource is loaded from the
        disk cache, the mime type is null, because the soup cache doesn't
        cache sniffed mime types. This doesn't happen when a resource is
        loaded form the memory cache, because the ResourceResponse is
        cached, not only the headers. I think the disk cache should also
        cache the sniffed content type, but that needs to be done in
        soup. For now we can workaround the issue in the unit test by
        making sure that resources that can be cached, also include the
        Content-Type header, this way the mime type won't be sniffed and
        it will be cached as a HTTP header in the disk cache.

        It happens because the print operation when started by the
        WebProcess due to a DOM operation is supposed to be synchronous
        and our print operation is always asynchronous. This is currently
        handled only in the UI process because other ports print
        synchronously in the WebProcess. In the GTK+ port we need to
        notify the WebProcess that the print operation should run
        synchronously when request by a DOM operation. Together with the
        print settings and page setup we now send a print mode that can be
        sync or async. When printing in sync mode we run a nested main loop

        Web Inspector: Do not try to parse incomplete HTTP requests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121123

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When working on a patch for bug #121121 I found an issue with the InspectorServer where it would try
        to parse an HTTP message before receiving the full message and thus fail connecting with the
        chromedevtools plugin.

        What happens is that the WebSocketServerConnection receives buffers on
        WebSocketServerConnection::didReceiveSocketStreamData and calls
        WebSocketServerConnection::readHTTPMessage which then checks if we have a valid request by calling
        HTTPRequest::parseHTTPRequestFromBuffer. If the request is valid it tries to parse the message and
        clears the buffer, otherwise it continues adding data to the internal buffer until we have a valid
        request.

        The problem is that currently HTTPRequest::parseHTTPRequestFromBuffer considers the request as valid
        before receiving the full message. To solve this we should make the method check if the request
        headers end with a blank line otherwise we consider the request as invalid (see also
        http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html).

        * UIProcess/API/gtk/tests/TestInspectorServer.cpp:
        (sendIncompleteRequest):
        (beforeAll):
        Add GTK specific test to check if the inspector server replies to incomplete requests.
        * UIProcess/InspectorServer/HTTPRequest.cpp:
        (WebKit::HTTPRequest::parseHeaders):
        Do not consider request valid if headers didn't end with a blank line.

        This allows for the UIProcess to run in a Wayland environment even when built with accelerated
        compositing enabled. Of course, at the moment there's no support yet for accelerated compositing
        under Wayland, so we fall back to rendering the backing store. No changes are introduced to
        the behavior under X11 - accelerated compositing will be used where possible, if supported.

        not provide any way to change that, it's enough to disable it when attaching the

        REGRESSION (r145458?): WebProcess doesn't respect UI process localization
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120096

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        We used to get into a situation where CFBundle thought that we had no good localization,
        and used one passed as default. This is never the case with mixed localizations,
        so default is just ignored now.

        I think that the previous behavior was a bit of a hack. As WebProcess is not localized,
        it's more honest to say that we want mixed localizations, and force the language
        to match UI process localization.

        * Shared/EntryPointUtilities/mac/LegacyProcess/ChildProcessEntryPoint.h:

        For all JSC types, this makes getOwnPropertyDescriptor redundant.
        There will be a bit more hacking required in WebCore to remove GOPD whilst maintaining current behaviour.

        (NetworkProcess)  Sync XHRs should load using async ResourceHandles, not ResourceHandle::loadResourceSynchronously
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119493

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        This patch does the following:
          - Consolidates SchedulableLoader and NetworkResourceLoader into one class.
          - Removes SyncNetworkResourceLoader.
          - Adds a NetworkLoaderClient interface that customizes certain behaviors of the NetworkResourceLoader.
          - Implements a SynchronousNetworkLoaderClient and AsynchronousNetworkLoaderClient for the two different types of loads.

        The AsynchronousNetworkLoaderClient results in messaging back progress to the WebProcess as the load progresses.
        The SynchronousNetworkLoaderClient accumulates the response, data, and error to be communicated back to the WebProcess
        only when the load is complete.

        is better per se, but not when we also need to have another one.

        Logging should be configurable using human-readable channel names rather than crazy bitmasks
        <http://webkit.org/b/119031>

        Implement shared logic for initializing logging channels based on human-readable channel names in WTF,
        and rework the WebCore, WebKit and WebKit2 logging initialization on top of it.

        Logging channels may now be enabled by providing a comma-separated list of channel names, with the special
        "all" name enabling all channels. Channel names prefixed with a leading "-" will result in the named channel
        being disabled. For instance, specifying "all,-history,-loading" will result in all logging channels except
        for history and loading being enabled.

        For OS X developers, this also changes the name of the user defaults used to enable logging. This is done to allow
        the old user defaults to remain set for those people that need to switch between version of WebKit before and
        after this change. Where the old user default keys were WebCoreLogLevel, WebKitLogLevel and WebKit2LogLevel,
        the new user default keys are WebCoreLogging, WebKitLogging and WebKit2Logging.

        For GTK developers, this changes the separator used in the WEBKIT_DEBUG environment variable to a comma for
        consistency with the other platforms and to enable more code sharing.

        While doing this work I've also taken the opportunity to eliminate the need to touch multiple files when
        adding a new logging channel. Now only the header in the relevant project needs to be updated.

        We can't use String::isolatedCopy for passing the local storage directory to the storage thread since
        that returns a String that's copied and then destroyed after the call to bind returns, leaving a small window
        where the refcount can be accessed simultaneously from two threads.

        Work around this by passing a PassRefPtr<StringImpl> to bind instead; the act of copying the PassRefPtr will
        clear out the original and so when the original is destroyed the underlying StringImpl pointer will be null.

        Normally we use the PluginDestructionProtector RAII object to prevent plug-ins from being destroyed while
        they're executing code. However, in the case of the NPObjectMessageReceiver::Deallocate message, we can't do this
        since we don't know the plug-in or connection. 
        
        Instead, add a counter to Connection that keeps track of whether sendSync is currently called and defer plug-in
        destruction if it is. (This approach is actually more robust and we should investigate getting rid of the destruction protector).

        CoordinatedGraphics: Add API to get and set the active state of a WebView
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119067

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        A view being in the "active" state generally means that it is not in the
        "background", although this definition can vary depending on the platform
        under consideration.

        This patch adds the following APIs to WKView:
        - bool WKViewIsActive(WKViewRef)
        This API accepts a WKViewRef as parameter and returns a boolean indicating
        whether the given view is active.

        - void WKViewSetIsActive(WKViewRef, bool)
        This API accepts a WKViewRef and a boolean as parameteres, and it sets the
        active state of the given view to the given boolean argument.

        * UIProcess/API/C/CoordinatedGraphics/WKView.cpp:
        (WKViewIsActive): API added.

        Reviewed by Gustavo Noronha Silva.

        Some tests, like GObject DOM bindings API tests, run entirely in
        the WebProcess, so we just need to start the test from the UI
        process and wait until the test finishes running in the
        WebProcess. Tests are split in two files, one containing the
        actual test that runs in the WebProcess and another one to add the
        tests to the glib test system that works as a
        proxy. WebProcessTestRunner class starts a private DBus session
        bus and starts the tests sending a message to the WebExtension
        waiting until it finishes or fails. WebProcess tests are created
        by defining a class derived from WebProcessTest class and
        implementing the static create method and the virtual runTest
        method. The macro REGISTER_TEST is used by the web process tests
        to register their test cases. This patch includes the migration
        of the WebKitDOMNode test, all other GObject DOM bindings tests
        will be migrated in the same way in follow up patches.

        Some mouseClick methods are used in test_ewk2_file_chooser_request.cpp.
        But it is difficult to understand what they mean.
        So i would like to replace those with more meaningful method for readability.

        EditorState tracking on UI side is very fragile. This is a targeted fix just for
        this specific scenario.

        The issue was that we had a stale m_temporarilyClosedComposition flag, which was
        making UI process believe that a composition was closed from WebProcess side,
        and notify input method about that. It shouldn't have been a problem, because there
        is no composition at this point indeed, but this extra call is a problem for
        predictive input, which works in a somewhat unconventional way (<rdar://problem/14458297>).

        WebTextCheckerClient doesn't initialize output arguments.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83683

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        Callers of checkSpellingOfString and checkGrammarOfString expect
        certain default values when no misspelled (or bad grammar) string
        is found. They try to do that by initialising the reply arguments
        that go into the IPC calls, but these values are ultimately ignored (see
        HandleMessage.h, where the replyArguments are declared).

        In the past, this seems to have led to various issues, (see
        TextCheckingHelper::findFirstMisspelling in TextCheckingHelper.cpp),
        where these return values are asserted and checked to be in the right range.

        This patch initialises the values, so even if no available client
        implements the methods (or if the implementation forgets to do it) the callers
        will have their expected output.

        However, and for a general case, we probably need a way to tell the caller
        that any existing value in the output arguments will be ignored.

        Coordinated Graphics: Separate CoordinatedLayerTreeHost into CoordinatedLayerTreeHost and CompositingCoordinator
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104360

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        The CoordinatedLayerTreeHost has too many responsibilities. It
        implements LayerTreeHost, GraphicsLayerClient,
        CoordinatedGraphicsLayerClient, CoordinatedImageBacking::Client,
        UpdateAtlas::Client, GraphicsLayerFactory and
        WebCustomFilterProgramProxyClient.

        This refactoring reduces the responsibilities of CoordinatedLayerTreeHost.

        This patch introduces a new class called CompositingCoordinator, which
        takes the responsibility of managing compositing resources in
        WebProcess.

        CoordinatedLayerTreeHost is responsible only for the scheduling and
        IPC-specific stuff, which are relevant only for WebKit2.

        No new tests, covered by existing tests.

        [EFL][WK2] Add WK2 C API to handle touch events.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108915

        Reviewed by Gyuyoung Kim.

        Touch events for our target platforms differ (XInput2, Wayland, Tizen) so
        for the EFL port we want to be able to feed events manually.

        To keep our current API for desktop EFL/Enlightenment working, we convert
        our currently limited EFL events to the new EFL specific C EwkTouchPoint
        and EwkTouchEvent type.

        EwkTouchPoint and EwkTouchEvent are exposed as WKTouchPointRef and
        WKTouchEventRef, so they are opaque in the applications.

        The WKViewSendTouchEvent can be used for any use-case (platform/product)
        not involving the EFL events.

        At the same time we make sure to avoid using WK2 internals in our EFL API
        implementation.

        In WebKit2, Widgets have no platformWidget, so trying to get to the

        However, we were already pushing the WKView's displayID down to the

        The WebProcess would not receive a displayID for a WKView until the window

        <rdar://problem/13145014> Allow CoreIPC messages to transmit importance boosts

        Transmitting the importance boost from the UI process to the web process is particularly
        important when disabling process suppression on a web process, as it will minimize the
        delays that can occur before the message instructing process suppression to be disabled
        is processed by the web process.

        We keep the importance boost alive for the duration of the CoreIPC message handler. We

        [Gtk] Connection is leaking when WebProcess is terminated
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117293

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        Connection is leaking because WorkQueue::SocketEventSource inherits from
        WorkQueue::EventSource but when it is destroyed, the actual destructor running
        is the one from base class; however, subclass contains a function binded from
        Connection (m_closeFunction) and we need to do this extra cleanup, otherwise
        WorkQueue will keep Connection alive. A better explanation of this fix is provided
        on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/461203/when-to-use-virtual-destructors

        A quick way to see the leak is to change WK2 test "ReloadPageAfterCrash" to terminate
        WebProcess N times and add a printf on Connection destructor.

        Coordinated Graphics : Refactor CoordinatedSurface to manage the lifecycle of GraphicsContext
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108899

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        This is a preparation patch for Threaded Coordinated Graphics.

        This patch changes CoordinatedSurface to be responsible for the
        lifecycle of GraphicsContext used in Coordinated Graphics System.
        CoordinatedImageBacking and UpdateAtlas do not ask for the ownership
        of GraphicsContext anymore. Instead, those classes use client pattern to
        ask the CoordiantedSurface to paint to the GraphicsContext.

        This refactoring is needed to implement CoordinatedSurface for Threaded
        Coordinated Graphics.

        Reviewed by Christophe Dumez.

        When using WEB_PROCESS_CMD_PREFIX - which allows us for instance to analyze
        WebProcess under tools like valgrind or gdb -, the ProcessLauncher would
        spawn the new process using system(), which would, among other things, keep
        an extra UIProcess waiting and executing the shell.

        This patch handles the normal case and the case where we have something to
        prefix WebProcess (i.e., by using WEB_PROCESS_CMD_PREFIX in a debug build)
        the same way, through a call to execvp().

        To achieve this a function was introduced to create an array with the given
        arguments to the full command to be executed, to be used by execvp(). We use
        a Vector<OwnArrayPtr<char>>, so that we can take advantage of the destructor
        of OwnArrayPtr to handle the memory deallocation when it goes out of scope.

        Valgrind reported a "conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value"
        at WebPageProxy constructor, when checking the m_isVisible variable inside
        the ENABLE(PAGE_VISIBILITY_API) guard.

        The issue was tracked down to the WebView constructor, which was creating a
        WebKit::PageClient* making use of `this' before having initialized all of its
        attributes.

        The solution was to move the initialization of the `page' member to inside the
        constructor itself - out of the initialization list -, where we can guarantee
        all the relevant stuff has already been properly initialized.

        In r146913, I added a 0-delay timer so that we'd coalesce intrinsic
        content size changes. However, didUpdateGeometry was still immediately
        invalidating the intrinsic content size without coalescing.

        [WK2] Notifications clobber each other with multiple processes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116428
        <rdar://problem/13935191>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        With multiple processes, the notification IDs, when passed up to the UI process, can clobber
        each other. To fix this, we need to maintain a global map of notification IDs. This map is
        keyed by its own unique notification ID, and maps to a pair containing the web page ID and that
        web page's ID for the notification.

        Now that we maintain groups of notifications based on the web page, we no longer send IPC messages
        from WebNotificationManager to WebNotificationManagerProxy; instead we send messages to the
        WebPageProxy. This removes the need for WebNotificationManagerProxy to be a message receiver.

        When a page closes, all of the web notifications are cleared out. However, by the time the
        WebPage::close() is called, the connection between WebPage and WebPageProxy is destroyed. Since
        the WebPage is told to close from the UI process anyway, we clear out the notifications separately,
        instead of waiting for a message from the WebPage.

        * UIProcess/Notifications/WebNotificationManagerProxy.h: Update to take into account the
        notification's web page. Remove inheritance of CoreIPC::MessageReceiver. Expose the original message
        handlers as public functions, since they will be called from WebPageProxy. Add a new map that
        associates a global ID with a notification ID that came from a web page.
            There are now two flavors of clearNotifications(). One clears out all notifications associated
        with a web page. This is called when the page is closed. The other clears out a subset of
        notifications associated with a web page. This is called when notifications associated with a sub-frame
        is closed.
        * UIProcess/Notifications/WebNotificationManagerProxy.messages.in: Removed. All messages from
        the web process go to WebPageProxy now.

        * UIProcess/Notifications/WebNotificationManagerProxy.cpp: Update to take into account the
        notification's web page.

        (WebKit::generateGlobalNotificationID): The manager proxy now maintains its own global notification
        ID generator.
        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::WebNotificationManagerProxy): The proxy is no longer a
        message receiver. Remove code that registers it as such.

        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::show): Refactor to differentiate between the notification ID
        that came from the web process, and the global notification ID the proxy maintains. Add the mapping
        from the global ID to the (web page ID, notification ID) pair.
        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::cancel): Refactor to take into consideration the web page.
        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::didDestroyNotification): Refactor to take into consideration
        the web page. Fixes a leak where we did not remove the item from the maps. This function is called
        from the web process, when the ScriptExecutionContext is destroyed, so we remove it from our maps
        before we pass the message along to the provider.

        Helper functions that evaluate when a given notification in the map matches the desired parameters.
        (WebKit::pageIDsMatch): The notification is associated with the provided page.
        (WebKit::pageAndNotificationIDsMatch): The notification is associated with the provided page and is
        contained within the list of provided notifications.

        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::clearNotifications): Changed to only remove notifications
        associated with the provided web page, and could include a specific list of notifications. This latter
        situation occurs if notifications were associated with an iframe, and that iframe was removed.
        There is an O(n) walk that could be make more efficient using another hash map, but that's overhead
        for a map that should be small in size anyway.

        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::providerDidShowNotification): Refactor to take into
        consideration the web page.
        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::providerDidClickNotification): Refactor to take into
        consideration the web page.
        (WebKit::WebNotificationManagerProxy::providerDidCloseNotifications): Now we need to comb through
        the list of global IDs and put them in buckets based on the notification's web pages. After that
        is done we can send the DidCloseNotifications() to those pages' processes. There is a possible
        extra optimization here where we group based on the page's process instead, to reduce the number
        of messages sent to processes.

        Crashes in NetworkProcess due to incorrect private browsing session tracking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116628

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        The current API for private browsing makes it extremely difficult to track sessions.
        Private browsing is enabled via WKPreferences, but the session is shared, so it
        has to be maintained while there is any chance that any page group anywhere still
        needs it.

        This patch fixes some of the issues, but ultimately, I think that we'll just need
        to deprecate and replace the API.

        * NetworkProcess/NetworkConnectionToWebProcess.cpp: (WebKit::storageSession):
        There are valid scenarios where privateBrowsingEnabled is true, but there is no

        <rdar://problem/11969491>

        Rubber-stamped by Sam Weinig.

        Private browsing override is unused, and it complicates tracking of private
        browsing sessions in UI process (in fact, it doesn't plug into this tracking at all,
        so we would just assert if we used the API).

        This will be used for serializing session storage state but I hope that it can be used for serializing

        In order to efficiently send a WKImageRef to another process when using the
        Objective-C WKConnection (or other user data messages), we need a way to encode
        WKTypeRefs in the objective-c object graph. Thus was born WKTypeRefWrapper.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116253

        The general approach here is:
        1 - Introduce a toWebFrameLoaderClient() function to convert FrameLoaderClients, and that may return null.
        2 - Adopt toWebFrameLoaderClient() everywhere we used to do a direct static_cast<WebFrameLoaderClient*>
        3 - In functions that already support a "return 0" scenario, a failed cast results in a return 0.
        4 - In other functions that assume no failure to get the WebFrameLoaderClient, add an ASSERT.

        Make the WebPageProxy::creationParameters use the accessor
        deviceScaleFactor() instead of using m_intrinsicDeviceScaleFactor
        directly. This will restore the custom device scale factor when
        reattaching to the WebProcess after a crash.

        Moreover, it will enable the Qt and ELF ports to use the
        existing C API for overriding the device scale factor instead
        of using the WebPageProxy directly or adding new C API to set
        the intrinsic device scale factor.

        Make sure that we ignore any leftover messages from the UI process after we've reset

        everytime the map is reset. Associate every storage area change with the seed and ignore any incoming 
        notification messages from the UI process if the seeds are different.

        Changed the logic of requestAnimationFrame in Coordinated Graphics.
        We don't send any IPC messages for requestAnimationFrame. Instead, we do one of two things:
        - If there is already a frame pending in the UI process, do nothing, as the animations would
          be serviced when the frame is returned to the web process.
        - If there is no frame pending, we schedule a flush, making sure that that flush occurs at 
          least 1/60 seconds after the last animation service, so that we don't get an infinite loop
          of flushes.

        [GTK] Use WebCore layer archives for TestWebCore, WebKitPluginProcess
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115918

        Reviewed by Gustavo Noronha Silva.

        Due to layer violations and circular dependencies the WebKitPluginProcess requires for the
        libraries containing the built code of the intertwining Platform and WebCore layers to be
        specified multiple times when linking. This can be avoided by packing the two layers' archives
        into one big archive, named after the WebCore layer due to no clear boundary between it and the
        Platform layer. The big archive can then be specified only once when linking, simplifying the code
        and suppressing all the layering violations so they do not cause build problems.

        First the libtool libraries that the WebCore layer (as required by the WebKitPluginProcess) depends on
        are specified. These are then used as dependencies for the archive creation rule as well as the list
        from which the archive file paths are constructed and then used to dump the member files from these archives.
        The member files are then added to the big archive. The latter is added to the list of libraries the
        WebKitPluginProcess requires to successfully link.

        [WK2] Make the WebSoupRequestManager a supplement to the WebProcess
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115717

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        WebSoupRequestManager should inherit from WebProcessSupplement and should be used as such
        by the WebProcess. This removes the need for the m_soupRequestManager member variable in
        the WebProcess class and brings the WebSoupRequestManager in line with other manager classes
        of which instances are controlled by the WebProcess class.

        [WKView visibleRect] be an intermediate value which will never be
        flushed to the screen. We only care about the final value, so we should

        [WK2] Make the WebBatteryManagerProxy a supplement to the WebContext
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115625

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Rather than holding a RefPtr to the WebBatteryManagerProxy object in WebContext, change the WebBatteryManagerProxy
        to implement the WebContextSupplement interface and handle the object as such in WebContext, simplifying its
        construction and cleanup, removing the specific RefPtr member variable and its correlating getter method.

        [WK2][CustomProtocols] NSURLProtocolClient methods should be dispatched on NSURLConnection's resource loader run loop
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115539

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        It turns out that calling NSURLProtocolClient methods from a different
        thread than the one running the NSURLConnection run loop is unsafe.
        Although I can't capture it reliably in a test case, doing so can
        sometimes result in a load timing out because the call to
        -[NSURLProtocolClient URLProtocolDidFinishLoading:] was ignored by
        NSURLConnection.

        Fix this by dispatching these methods on the NSURLConnection resource
        load run loop. This matches where NSURLProtocolClient methods are
        dispatched by typical NSURLProtocol implementations, and in my testing
        this solves the timeout issue.

        Inspector window is often blank when opened
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115220

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.
        
        After disabling tiled scrolling and accelerated drawing in r149006, the
        Inspector window was often missing its content after opening. This only
        happened when the user has a preference on disk to use accelerated drawing
        in the Inspector.
        
        The missing content was caused by a failure to connect the correct contextID
        for remote layer hosting. On window creation, we hook up a context using
        WindowServer layer hosting (the default), but then switch back to app-hosted
        layers for the Inspector window. This switching happens in didUpdateBackingStoreState(),
        but that can be re-entered via its call to sendUpdateBackingStoreState(). In
        that cause, on unwinding the stack it would call enterAcceleratedCompositingMode()
        with a stale layerTreeContext.
        
        Fix by moving the code that exits/enters accelerated compositing mode to before
        the call to sendUpdateBackingStoreState() that can cause re-entrancy. That avoids
        use of a possibly stale layerTreeContext.

        [WebKit2] Loading a resource from a custom protocol in a synchronous XHR times out
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115223

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When WebKit performs a synchronous load on the Mac, it spins a nested
        run loop in a mode that only accepts input from the NSURLConnection
        performing the load. When the load is for a custom protocol in WebKit2,
        we proxy it to the UI process via CoreIPC messages, but the response
        messages from the UI process are never processed as long as the run
        loop is in a non-common mode (and we wouldn't want to process messages
        that could re-enter WebCore in the middle of loading, anyway). Since
        these messages never make it back to the NSURLConnection handling the
        request, the connection eventually times out.

        Fix this by using a work queue to handle custom protocol messages in
        the networking process. The work queue can process incoming custom
        protocol messages while the main thread is blocked.

        Reviewed by Gustavo Noronha Silva.

        Work around the missing symbols in the WebKitPluginProcess by specifying the required libraries
        multiple times in the program's LDADD list. Libtool fights fiercely to avoid duplicate static library
        references among the linker arguments (even if using the --preserve-dup-deps flag) so the required libraries
        are specified in various ways.

        The unresolved symbols in object files are no longer ignored as this can lead to further trouble (for instance
        this patch also adds a few missing source files to the list of WebKitPluginProcess sources). The Freetype and
        gamepad dependencies' libraries are also added to the binary's LDADD list.
