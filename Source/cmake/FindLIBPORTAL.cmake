FindLIBPORTAL
-------------

Find libportal headers and libraries.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``LIBPORTAL::LIBPORTAL``
  The LIBPORTAL library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables in your project:

``LIBPORTAL_FOUND``
  true if (the requested version of) LIBPORTAL is available.
``LIBPORTAL_VERSION``
  the version of LIBPORTAL.
``LIBPORTAL_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use LIBPORTAL.
``LIBPORTAL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find the LIBPORTAL headers.
``LIBPORTAL_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  this should be passed to target_compile_options(), if the
  target is not used for linking
