// This is an appropriate way to stash IsoSubspaces for rarely-used classes or classes that are mostly
// sure to be main-thread-only. But if a class typically gets instantiated from multiple threads at
// once, then this is not great, because concurrent allocations will probably contend on this thing's
// lock.
//
// Usage: A IsoSubspacePerVM instance is instantiated using NeverDestroyed i.e. each IsoSubspacePerVM
// instance is immortal for the life of the process. There is one IsoSubspace type per IsoSubspacePerVM.
// IsoSubspacePerVM itself is a factory for those IsoSubspaces per VM and per Heap. IsoSubspacePerVM
// also serves as the manager of the IsoSubspaces. Client VMs are responsible for calling
// releaseClientIsoSubspace() to release the IsoSubspace when the VM shuts down. Similarly, if the
// Heap is not an immortal singleton heap (when global GC is enabled), the per Heap IsoSubspace also
// needs to be released when the Heap is destructed.
