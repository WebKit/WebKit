        Our runtime allows CustomGetterSetter objects setter field to not contain an
        actual C function to call. In such a scenario, the runtime just does nothing
        except return false to the ::put code (which may result in throwing an
        exception in strict mode code). 
        
        However, our IC code never considered whether this function could be nullptr.
        The fix here is simple: don't IC such custom accessor/value setters.

        Consider the following program:

                b: CreateActivation()
                _: Branch(bb2, bb1)
            bb1:
                _: PutByOffset(a, 'x', 42)

                _: Branch(bb2, bb1)
            bb2:
                _: CheckStructure(a, {x: 0})
                _: PutClosureVar(b, 0, Kill:a)
                _: Branch(bb3, bb2)
            bb3:
                c: GetClosureVar(b, 0)
                _: PutByOffset(global, 'y', c)
                _: Return

        Due to the order we visit the program, we'll visit bb2 before bb1. The first time we visit bb2, heapAtHead will be:
            #@a: ObjectAllocation({})
            #@b: ActivationAllocation()
            @a => #@a
            @b => #@b

        Now CheckStructure would always fail, so it will escape @a and heapAtTail will be:
            #@a: EscapedAllocation()
            #@b: ActivationAllocation()
            @a => #@a
            @b => #@b

        And after pruning:
            #@b: ActivationAllocation()
            @b => #@b

        Now, we'll visit bb3 and then bb1. When we visit bb1 we'll set the structure {x: 0} for the #@a and eventually visit bb2 again. This time around CheckStructure will no longer escape @a, since the allocation has the right structure, and heapAtTail will be:
            #@a: ObjectAllocation({x: 0})
            #@b: ActivationAllocation(0: #@a)
            @b => #@b

        However, we now have to merge into bb3, which has heapAtHead:
            #@b: ActivationAllocation()
            @b => #@b

        Since we can't add the extra field to the activation, we'll end up escaping @a at the edge and therefore pruning #@b, which will leave the heap for bb3 unchanged.
        That's a problem, since PutClosureVar didn't see the escaped object, but GetClosureVar thinks it's escaped. The materialization for @a will be placed after the
        PutClosureVar, at end of bb2, when the node is already dead. When computing the SSA defs, the PutByOffset at bb3 will then see @a (which at this point will be a
        PhantomNewObject) instead of its materialization.

        The issue happens because we don't allow allocations to add extra fields while merging, but we do allow adding new structures. This results in different decisions
        being made about what escapes in CheckStructure and MultiGetByOffset. To avoid this problem, we track two sets of structures: structures and structuresForMaterialization.
        The first is used for checks and should never grow while the second is used for materialization and is allowed to grow.

        [JSC] Apply Intl.DateTimeFormat hour-cycle correctly when timeStyle is used
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216521

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        When specifying timeStyle in Intl.DateTimeFormat, we need to check that the generated format also follows to the hourCycle / hour12 options
        specified in the constructor. Because dayPeriod can be included automatically, just replacing symbols after generating a pattern can dump strange result.
        For example, the generated one is something like "02:12:47 PM Coordinated Universal Time". And we adjust the pattern to make it "14:12:47 PM Coordinated Universal Time"
        when hourCycle H23 / H24 is specified. But this looks strange since dayPeriod "PM" should not exist when using H23 / H24.

        In this patch, we revise our hour-cycle handling in Intl.DateTimeFormat. We align our behavior to SpiderMonkey's one[1] rather than the spec's one: when hour12 is specified,
        we will just use 'H' or 'h' skeleton and do not enforce hour-cycle after generating pattern in hour12 case. If hour12 is not specified, then we use 'h' or 'H' skeleton
        symbols based on hour-cycle, and later we modify the pattern based on hour-cycle. If both are not offered, we use 'j' which allows ICU to pick preferable one.
        This is slightly different behavior to the spec (hcDefault etc.) but the spec's behavior can cause a bit surprising result[2,3], and SpiderMonkey like behavior will be
        integrated into the spec eventually[4].

        This patch adds "collation" option to Intl.Collator. We are already getting consensus[1], and will be integrated into the spec.
        Previously, passing "collation" is only available through "-u-co-" unicode extension in the passed locale. The proposal exposes
        collation option as an option to Intl.Collator so that we can set it easily.
        "collation" is used only when "usage" is "sort". "search" usage will filter out collation options since "search" itself is one of
        the "collation" option.

        Following the ArraySetLength spec steps precisely [1] would result in

        Don't assume byte code operands are uint32 JSValues

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        The slow path for enumerator_generic_pname was assuming that its input index operand
        would always be a UInt32 JSValue boxed as int32. However, this assumption isn't true
        because that value can have double format in the DFG, and remain in that format when
        we exit from the DFG to baseline/LLInt code.
        
        This was found via the widening number fuzzing agent.
        
        I also audited two more places that seem like they suffer from the same issue,
        and also switched them to using the asUInt32AsAnyInt function:
        - enumerator_structure_pname
        - create_rest

        [JSC] attribute-change transition should not pin Structure
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215528

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch avoids using pin in attribute-change transition. To achieve this, attribute-change transition is now fully supported
        transition chain in forEachPropertyConcurrently etc.: we can retrieve properties with changed attributes correctly via traversing
        transition chain. And we also support attribute-change transition in materializePropertyTable, so we do not need to pin structure.

        The design largely mimics existing removePropertyTransition and addPropertyTransition. This patch also adds `hasBeenDictionary()`
        check before adding structure to the transition so that we can avoid adding unnecessary structure entry to the transition table.

        [JSC] unshift / shift should take structure lock
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216378
        <rdar://problem/68496096>

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        When unshifting / shifting butterfly, we need to move property storage values too.
        If property storage values are moved while concurrent JIT compiler is accessing it, it could include garbage value.

        For example, concurrent JIT compiler is accessing [2] property storage.

                            1          2         3
                       [ JSValue ][ JSValue ][ Header ]

        But unshift moved it like this.

                            1          2         3
            [ JSValue ][ JSValue ][ Header ]

        Since butterfly pointer held by JSObject is not updated yet, concurrent JIT compiler will read [ Header ] as JSValue and crash.
        In this patch, we take structure lock when shifting existing butterfly since this affect on property storage. Since JSObject::getDirectConcurrently
        takes a structure lock, this locking prevents concurrent compilers from getting an invalid value.

        Web Inspector: modernize generated backend protocol code
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216302
        <rdar://problem/68547649>

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        Previously, the inspector protocol was expressed in code in a somewhat confusing way:
         - the error string was the first argument
         - required parameters were `T` or `const T&`
         - optional parameters were `const T*`
         - enum parameters were the underlying type requiring the backend dispatcher handler to
           process it instead of it being preprocessed
         - required returns were `T&`
         - optional returns were `T*`
        This doesn't really make for easy/obvious reading of code since the order of arguments is
        not weird (e.g. error string first), and that there are references/pointers to primitive
        types.

        This patch cleans up the generated inspector protocol code to be:
         - required parameters are `T` or `Ref<T>&&`
         - optional parameters are `Optional<T>&&` or `RefPtr<T>&&`
         - enum parameters are preprocessed and passed to the backend dispatcher handler if valid
         - synchronous commands return `Expected<X, ErrorString>` using the same types/rules above
           where `X` is either a single return or a `std::tuple` of multiple returns

        The one exception to the above is `String`, which is already a tri-state of `nullString()`,
        `emptyString()`, and something set, so there's no need to use `Optional<String>`.

        Also use `Protocol` objects/`typedefs` wherever possible to further relate the protocol
        JSON and the actual backend dispatcher handler implementation.

        OutOfBoundsSaneChain operations should use their own heap locations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216328
        <rdar://problem/68568039>

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        There is code in local CSE that does some basic bounds check elimination
        for PutByVal. It does this analysis by seeing if a particular heap location
        is already defined, and if so, it eliminates the bounds check for the
        PutByVal. This doesn't work for OutOfBoundsSaneChain for the obvious reason
        that these GetByVals are not proven to be in bounds. So GetByVal's in the
        OutOfBoundsSaneChain mode reusing non OutOfBoundsSaneChain heap locations
        can lead to a bug where we mistakenly remove a bounds check. The fix is to
        have all OutOfBoundsSaneChain operations use distinct heaps, and for CSE to
        not query those heaps.

        [JSC] Align legacy Intl constructor behavior to spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216193

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Legacy Intl constructors (Intl.DateTimeFormat and Intl.NumberFormat) have special handling when it is called via `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` form.
        This allowed legacy Intl constructors to be used with prototype-based inheritance without using class syntax. This legacy behavior is later specified
        explicitly in the spec. So we should align our implementation to the spec's one.

            1. When defining fallback formats, we need to put them into the property which is visible via Symbol("IntlLegacyConstructedSymbol").
            2. Even if the provided thisValue is IntlDateTimeFormat* / IntlNumberFormat*, we should create another instance and put it to Symbol("IntlLegacyConstructedSymbol") field.

        [JSC] Cache toString / valueOf / @@toPrimitive for major cases
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216061

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        When toPrimitive is called, we need to look-up three properties at most to perform operation. And these special properties do not have caching mechanism at all.
        We found that Speedometer2/EmberJS-Debug-TodoMVC is using very much time for this property look-up. We should have caching mechanism in StructureRareData, which
        should be similar to @@toStringTag & Object#toString caching mechanism.

        This patch generalizes @@toStringTag & Object#toString caching mechanism as SpecialPropertyCache. And we accelerate toString / valueOf / @@toPrimitive look-ups in
        toPrimitive with this caching mechanism.

        This patch improved Speedometer2/EmberJS-Debug-TodoMVC by 10%.

          - https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-dataview-prototype-object

        At the same time:
         - get rid of JSDataView::getOwnPropertySlot, which was turning dataViewProtoGetterByte{Length,Offset}
           into mostly unreachable code and erroneously causing byte{Length,Offset} to have property descriptors
         - perform some simple cleanup of neighboring error calls / messages
         - fix value of DataView.length (our only other DataView spec bug)

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We had race condition during construction of StructureStubInfo and CodeOrigin field setting.

            1. The thread creates StructureStubInfo by calling CodeBlock::addStubInfo. This is guarded by the lock. But at this point we are not setting StructureStubInfo::codeOrigin.
            2. Then (1)'s thread attempts to set StructureStubInfo::codeOrigin. But at this point, it is not guarded by the lock.
            3. Before (2) is executed, DFG ByteCodeParser calls CodeBlock::getICStatusMap. It creates HashMap<CodeOrigin, StructureStubInfo*>.
            4. Since StructureStubInfo*'s codeOrigin is not configured yet, (3) sees invalid CodeOrigin. And storing invalid CodeOrigin as a HashMap key is not correct.

        We should configure CodeOrigin at construction of StructureStubInfo, which is guarded by the lock. We have the same problem for CallLinkInfo and ByValInfo. This patch fixes them.
        To reproduce this, we need to execute a script 2~ days repeatedly. So it is difficult to add a test.

        __proto__ in object literal should perform [[SetPrototypeOf]] directly

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        To fix __proto__ usage in object literals if Object.prototype.__proto__ is overridden
        or removed, this patch sets the [[Prototype]] directly, aligning JSC with V8 and
        SpiderMonkey. We are safe to skip method table lookups and cycle checks, as the
        spec [1] calls [[SetPrototypeOf]] on newly created (unreferenced) ordinary objects.

        This change removes PropertyNode::PutType because its only purpose was to accomodate
        __proto__ in object literals. Since emitPutConstantProperty() handles static public
        class fields, which don't need `super` binding, PropertyNode::isUnderscoreProtoSetter()
        is extended to reject class properties.

        This patch speeds up creating object literals with __proto__ by 25%.

        OSR availability validation should run for any node with exitOK
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215672

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Currently we only validate OSR exit availability if a node would
        say `mayExit(graph, node) != DoesNotExit` and the node is marked
        as exitOK. However, it would be perfectly valid to insert a node
        that exits anywhere we have a node marked exitOK. So with this
        patch we now validate all places where it would ever be possible
        to OSR exit.

        Relaxing our criteria revealed a number of bugs however. Which I
        will describe below in, IMO, increasing complexity/subtly.

        First, we currently don't mark arity fixup during inlining as not
        exitOK. However, since our arity code says its code origin is
        OpEnter, we assume arity fixup has already happened.

        Second, OpGetScope, should not mark its first argument as used
        since it's not actually used. This is problematic because we could
        have a loop where OpGetScope is the first bytecode, namely when
        doing tail recursive inlining. If we were in that position, there
        could be a local that was used at a merge point at the loop
        backedge that had two MovHint defs from both predecessors. In DFG
        IR this would look like:

        BB#1:
        @1: MovHint(Undefined, loc1)
        ...
        Jump(#2)

        BB#2:
        ... // loc1 is live here in bytecode
        @2: MovHint(@scopeObject, loc1)
        @3: SetLocal(@scopeObject, loc1)
        Branch(#3, #4) // #4 is the successor of the tail call loop

        BB#3:
        @4 MovHint(Undefined, loc1)
        ...
        Jump(#2)

        When we do CPS conversion the MovHints at @1 and @4 will be seen
        as different variables (there's no GetLocal). Then, after, during
        SSA conversion we won't insert a phi connecting them, making the
        argument to OpGetScope, in this case loc1, unrecoverable there are
        conflicting nodes and the value isn't saved on the stack.

        There were also issues with MovHintRemoval Phase but rather than
        fix them we opted to just remove the phase as it didn't show any
        performance impact. I'll describe the issues I found below for
        completeness, however.

        Third, MovHint removal phase had a bug where it would not mark
        sections where a zombied MovHint has yet to be killed as not
        exitOK. So in theory another phase could come along and insert an
        exiting node there.

        Fourth, MovHint removal phase had a second bug where a MovHint
        that was not killed in the current block would be zombied, which
        is wrong for SSA. It's wrong because the MovHinted value could
        still be live for OSR exit in a successor block.

        Lastly, this patch adds some new verbose options as well as the ability to
        dump a DFG::BasicBlock without dereferencing it.

        This patch:

        1. Replaces all putLength() call sites with setLength(), saving two JSValue
           instantiations in arrayProtoFuncPop() and two in arrayProtoFuncShift().

        2. Merges putLength() into setLength(), removing superfluous put() call for
           JSArray. Also, performs put() in strict mode to preserve the original
           error messages, like ones in ProxyObject::performPut().

        3. Inlines performPop(), which avoided an extra index check and Identifier
           creation, as it was on the slow path anyway (note JSArray::pop() call).

        This change advances provided setLength()-heavy microbenchmark by ~40%,

        [JSC] Add ASCII comparison fast path for IntlCollator
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215798

        Reviewed by Darin Adler, Ross Kirsling, and Saam Barati.

        The idea behind this change is the following: ICU Collator's comparison is too slow. We should have fast path for ASCII strings when we know this equals to ICU Collator's result.
        The problem is that even for ASCII strings, collation is super complicated!

            1. Unicode defines Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA). To perform collation, it uses collation element tables which defines weights on various levels per code point. UCA also offers
               the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET). This UCA with DUCET is used when using ICU Root Collator.
            2. UCA collation consists of rules, which defines how collation works. And ICU locales define customized collations by adding special rules to that.
            3. UCA behaves differently by using different options.

        Based on that, our observation is that some of major locales are not defining additional rules in (2). This means that they behaves the same to UCA with DUCET.
        This patch implements a simplified version of comparison which generates the same results for ASCII strings (excluding control characters) to UCA with DUCET. This fast path can be usable only when the following conditions are met.

            1. The collator does not have additional rules to ICU Root Colator.
            2. The collator is using default options.

        These checks are very important since there are a lot of edge-case locales. For example,

            1. th (Thai language) ignores punctuations (even including ASCII punctuations) by default. This is defined as ignore-punctuations option is enabled by default, so without (2)'s check, th comparison becomes wrong.
            2. There are contraction concept (multiple letters behave as a single letter). "ch" letters are ordered interestingly in Czech language. So even in ASCII, Czech shows very interesting collation behavior.

        So we cannot safely take this fast path without carefully querying the information to ICU.

        This shows 37% improvement in JetStream2/cdjs in en-US environment.

        Web Inspector: breakpoint condition should be evaluated before the ignore count
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215364
        <rdar://problem/67310703>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Previously, when pausing, `JSC::Breakpoint` would check that it's `ignoreCount` before it
        would even attempt to evaluate it's `condition`. This meant that a `JSC::Breakpoint` with
        a `condition` of `foo === 42` and an `ignoreCount` of `3` would ignore the first three
        pauses and then only pause if `foo === 42`. This is likely contrary to the expectation of
        most users (especially since the `condition` input is before the `ignoreCount` input in
        the Web Inspector frontend UI) in that they would probably expect to ignore the first
        three pauses if `foo === 42`.

        Invalid early error for object literal method named "__proto__"
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215760

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        According to Annex B [1], `{ __proto__: null, __proto__() {} }` is a valid object literal as the second
        `__proto__` wasn't obtained from `PropertyDefinition : PropertyName : AssignmentExpression` production.
        Currently, JSC throws an early SyntaxError, unlike V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        Since a method needs `super` binding, the most straightforward fix would be adding SuperBinding field
        to SyntaxChecker::Property and exposing it via an accessor. However, given that Property is a very
        common structure, this approach would noticeably increase memory pressure during parsing.

        Instead, this patch reworks SyntaxChecker::Property to accept `isUnderscoreProtoSetter` parameter,
        removing optional `name` field, its accessor, and shouldCheckPropertyForUnderscoreProtoDuplicate(),
        which reduces sizeof(SyntaxChecker::Property) by a factor of 8: from 16 to 2 bytes.
        Also, this change avoids two extra makeNumericIdentifier() calls, speeding up numeric keys parsing.

        This approach is feasible because "__proto__" is the only identifier-based early error for object
        literals [2], with no such errors being added in upcoming stage 2-4 proposals.

        Additionally, this patch removes `strict` / `complete` bool parameter from {parse,create}Property()
        signatures as a) it was always `true`, b) is now unused, and c) strict mode can be checked via scope.

        Implementation of the class "extends" clause incorrectly uses __proto__ for setting prototypes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205848

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        To prevent `class extends` from breaking if Object.prototype.__proto__ is overridden
        or removed, this patch replaces OpPutById bytecodes in ClassExprNode::emitBytecode()
        with JSObject::setPrototypeDirect() invocations via OpCall.

        Since the spec sets [[Prototype]] values directly [1], we are safe to skip method
        table lookups and cycle checks.

        Although this approach adds 4 `mov` ops to emitted bytecode for `class extends` creation,
        increasing instruction count to 35, I prefer it over introducing a slow path only op.
        To avoid emitting 2 extra `mov` ops, globalFuncSetPrototypeDirect() uses thisRegister().

        Aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey. Derived class creation microbenchmark is neutral.

        DFG should always run CFG Simplification after Constant Folding.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215286

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        We didn't do this originally because LICM, many years ago, was
        unsound if the CFG didn't have exactly the right shape around
        loops. This is no longer true so we don't have to worry about
        changing the CFG anymore. While, this doesn't appear to be a
        speedup on JetStream 2 CFG, probably because we'd eventually
        simplify the graph in B3, CFG Simplification is very cheap and
        make other DFG optimizations easier in the future.

        Also, remove unecessary validation rule that no exitOKs can come
        before any Phi nodes in DFG. This isn't required and fails after
        merging two basic blocks where the latter block has a Phi.

        Remove MovHintRemoval phase
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215785

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The MovHintRemoval phase doesn't play nicely with our OSR
        Availability. Specifically, it needs to do a tricky dance where it
        marks all the live ranges of the ZombieHints as not
        exitOK. There's also an issue because we treated unused locals as
        kill in this block, which is wrong for SSA when a MovHint is
        used in another block. Since removing MovHintRemoval isn't a
        performance regression, we are removing it rather than fixing bugs
        related to it. Relatedly, since the only place we produce
        ZombieHints is MovHintRemoval this patch also removes that node
        type.

        Create a private `ProtocolBreakpoint` class that holds the data sent by the frontend. This
        is necessary because breakpoints in the frontend have a potentially one-to-many relationship
        with breakpoints in the backend, as the same script can be loaded many times on a page. Each
        of those scripts is independent, however, and can execute differently, meaning that the same
        breakpoint for each script also needs a different state (e.g. ignore count). As such, the
        `ProtocolBreakpoint` is effectively a template that is actualized whenever a new script is
        parsed that matches the URL of the `ProtocolBreakpoint` to create a `JSC::Breakpoint` that
        is used by the `JSC::Debugger`. `ProtocolBreakpoint` also parses breakpoint configurations.

        Since ECMA402 requires enforcement of hourCycle specified from the option, even if ICU ignores that.
        So, after getting the appropriate pattern from ICU, we modify this pattern and re-create UDateFormat

        [ECMA-402] Implement unified Intl.NumberFormat
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209774

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling and Darin Adler.

        This patch implements updated Intl.NumberFormat. This update was proposed in [1], and integrated into ECMA-402 spec.
        This patch adds support for missing features in the previous Intl.NumberFormat implementation. Adding "unit", "unitDisplay",
        "signDisplay", "notation", and "currencySign". Then Intl.NumberFormat can now handle "unit" etc.

        To support new features, we need to use UNumberFormatter which is available after ICU 64 (while it is offered in ICU 62, some
        critical part are added in 64 too). So, we keep the old UNumberFormat based implementation which is used for [60, 64) since WebKit
        currently supports ICU 60. Old implementation does not support new things. If ICU is 64 or later, Intl.NumberFormat starts using
        UNumberFormatter, and implements all the specified features.

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        This change defines Function.prototype.length [1] as [[Configurable]] and
        removes "length" properties from other (async/generator) function prototypes 
        that are ordinary non-callable objects [2], aligning JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        Also, adds inherits() ASSERT in FunctionPrototype::finishCreation()
        to match (most of) the other built-ins.

        This patch fixes to integer conversion of target function's "length" values
        beyond UINT_MAX, aligning JSC with the spec [1], V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        `double` is used instead of `uint64_t` to retain semantics of JS Number type [2]
        and hold Infinity values. To avoid spreading `double length` over JSFunction::create()
        and its subclasses, JSBoundFunction is modified to use JSFunction::finishCreation(VM&)
        overload, removing 2 unused arguments and speeding up bound function creation by ~9%.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        The put_by_id opcode in the baseline and the DFG/FTl will emit a writeBarrier
        after the operation is complete. But it does this to the base object. In the
        case of an IC with the base as a Proxy, we're not actually storing to the Proxy, but
        instead, the Proxy's target. This patch makes it so our IC code writeBarriers
        the Proxy's target. This fixed a crash when running Speedometer2.

        [JSC] Add Object.getOwnPropertyNames caching as it is done for Object.keys, and accelerate Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215666

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Object.getOwnPropertyNames is immutable for Structure if structure meets some conditions. And we have optimization for Object.keys.
        This patch wires existing caching mechanism for Object.keys to Object.getOwnPropertyNames so that Object.getOwnPropertyNames has
        full support of caching & inlined code in DFG / FTL.

        We also pre-bake structure for the result of Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor so that we do not need to perform hash table lookup every
        time we create an object for Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor. This makes Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor 2x faster from the microbenchmark.

        The above two optimization makes Speedometer2/Inferno-TodoMVC 7% faster, and it also optimizes Speedometer2/EmberJS-Debug by 5%.
        In total, we can get 0.7 - 1.0% progression in Speedometer2.

        Introduce OpIsCallable bytecode and intrinsic
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215572

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling and Saam Barati.

        This patch:

        1. Aligns slow_path_is_function with DFG/FTL implementations by introducing
           jsTypeofIsFunction() helper. This fixes `typeof document.all === "function"`
           to return `false` instead of `true`.

        2. Renames is_function bytecode op to typeof_is_function, aligning it with
           typeof_is_undefined and typeof_is_object. New name offers better semantics
           and clearly communicates the op should be avoided when implementing new
           features because of `typeof` behavior with [[IsHTMLDDA]] objects [1].

        3. Adds is_callable bytecode op and utilizes it in built-ins via intrinsic,
           removing `typeof callback === "function"` checks. This prevents [[IsHTMLDDA]]
           objects from being considered non-callable [2].

           To preserve the fast path for JSFunctionType,
           createFunctionThatMasqueradesAsUndefined() is relocated to InternalFunction.

        `typeof` microbenchmarks are neutral.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds a new ArrayMode speculation in the DFG/FTL called OutOfBoundsSaneChain.
        It allows us to do fast things when we go OOB, like simply return undefined.
        This is because we install watchpoints on the prototype chain to ensure they
        have no indexed properties. This patch implements OutOfBoundsSaneChain on
        GetByVal over Int32/Double/Contiguous original JS arrays. We can extend it in
        the future to non original JS arrays if we prove their prototype is Array.prototype. 
        To implement this properly, we also need to ensure that the index isn't negative,
        as Array.prototype/Object.prototype may have negative indexed accessors. We
        do this via speculation, and if we ever recompile, and see an exit because of
        this, we will stop speculating OutOfBoundsSaneChain.
        
        This is about 20% faster on crypto-md5-SP. And ~3-4x faster on the
        microbenchmarks I created.

        Remove OpIsObjectOrNull from ClassExprNode::emitBytecode()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214525

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch:

        1. Replaces OpIsObjectOrNull in ClassExprNode::emitBytecode() [1] with emitIsObject() +
           emitIsNull(), preventing DFG/FTL from throwing a TypeError if `document.all` is the
           value of superclass "prototype" property, which aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.
           Also, tweaks error message to reflect that `null` is allowed.

        2. Renames is_object_or_null bytecode op to typeof_is_object, fixing the confusing
           operationObjectIsObject() name, and aligns it with typeof_is_undefined.
           New name offers better semantics and clearly communicates the op should be avoided when
           implementing new features because of `typeof` behavior with [[IsHTMLDDA]] objects [2].

        OSRAvailabilityAnalysis shouldn't mark GetStack nodes directly as valid places for recovery
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215434

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        It's somewhat subtle why we cannot use the node for the GetStack
        itself in the Availability's node field. The reason is that if we
        did we would need to make any phase that converts nodes to
        GetStack availability aware. For instance, a place where this
        could come up is in constant folding if you had a graph like the
        following, which could arise from PutStack sinking:

        BB#1:
        @1: NewObject()
        @2: MovHint(@1, inline-arg1)
        @3: Jump(#2, #3)

        BB#2:
        @4: PutStack(@1, inline-arg1)
        @5: GetMyArgumentByVal(inline-arg1)
        @6: Jump(#3)

        BB#3:
        @7: InvalidationPoint()

        If constant folding converts @5 to a GetStack then at @7
        inline-arg1 won't be available since at the end of BB#1 our
        availability is (@1, DeadFlush) and (@5,
        FlushedAt(inline-arg1)). When that gets merged at BB#3 then the
        availability will be (nullptr, ConflictingFlush).

        This patch also makes validation check that availability is sane
        at each pontential exit site if
        Options::validateFTLOSRExitLiveness() is set. Since this is
        actually a Phase we also need to make sure that we don't infinite
        loop, so there is now a m_isValidating field on m_graph. The
        validateOSRExitAvailability phase is also careful not to modify
        the Graph, in order to avoid masking bugs when validating.

        In a followup patch I intend to look into why MovHint elimination
        will convert:

        @2: MovHint(@0, loc1, bc#1, ExitInvalid)
        @3: KillStack(loc1, bc#2, ExitValid)
        @4: MovHint(@1 loc1, bc#2, ExitInvalid)

        into

        @2: ZombieHint(@0, loc1, bc#1, ExitInvalid)
        @3: KillStack(loc1, bc#2, ExitValid)
        @4: MovHint(@1 loc1, bc#2, ExitInvalid)

        when loc1 is live in the bytecode at bc#2. But for now, the
        validation rule works around this by only checking when mayExit
        and the nodes exitOK agree exiting is possible.

        With this change, a non-dictionary structure adds attribute-change transitions
        to transition table, making redefinition to previous atttributes a fast path.

        After too many transitions, the structure becomes a dictionary, firing the
        transition watchpoint. Attribute-change transitions pin their property tables,
        preventing forEachPropertyConcurrently() traversal.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch implements new encoding of StructureTransitionTable::Hash::Key
        to enable storing attribute change transitions in a transition table.

        Since PropertyMapEntry attributes are always uint8_t, the remaining 8 bits
        are used for TransitionKind, which also accommodates non-property transitions,
        removing a bit hacky toAttributes() and utilization of unused pointer bits.

        This change also introduces TransitionKind::Unknown we can validate against,
        preventing addition transition from being a default, which could be unsafe.

        Remove the need for defining USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215439

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When building WebKit for XCBuild, we currently require that the
        external build system (such as the Makefile, build-webkit, etc.)
        defines the USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM=YES build setting. This build setting
        controls parts of our build instructions that are sensitive to when
        XCBuild or the Legacy build system are being used. Notably, we need to
        know when to use our custom “copy and modify” scripts with copying
        certain header files (used with the Legacy build system) vs. using the
        enhanced Copy Headers build phase that’s enabled with
        APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_HEADERS=YES (introduced with and used by XCBuild).
        The choice of which method to copy headers is used is controlled by
        USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM.

        There is no built-in build setting that we can probe to help us
        determine which approach to take when copying and modifying headers,
        which is why we need to define USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM ourselves. But it
        turns out that we can *detect* which build system is being used by
        taking advantage of a subtle difference between the two systems. As
        noted in:

            https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/build-system-release-notes-for-xcode-10

            “When an .xcconfig file contains multiple assignments of the same
             build setting, later assignments using $(inherited) or
             $(<setting_name>) will inherit from earlier assignments in the
             .xcconfig. The legacy build system caused every use of
             $(inherited) or $(<setting_name>) skip any other values defined
             within the .xcconfig.”

        This difference can be exploited as follows:

            WK_WHICH_BUILD_SYSTEM = not_
            WK_WHICH_BUILD_SYSTEM = $(inherited)legacy
            WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM = $(WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM_$(WK_WHICH_BUILD_SYSTEM))
            WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM_legacy = NO
            WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM_not_legacy = YES

        We can then use WK_USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM where we used to use the
        externally-defined USE_NEW_BUILD_SYSTEM.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        We didn't used to cache any Puts on PureForwardingProxy. This patch
        implements Replace and JS/Custom Setters on PureForwardingProxy. We don't support
        Transition puts because in our current implementation different global objects
        will never share the same structure.
        
        This patch also aligns how our runtime and the ICs invoke Customs when the
        passed in |this| value is a JSProxy. For custom accessors, our runtime passes
        in the JSProxy, where our ICs used to pass in the target of the JSProxy, for
        the receiver value. For custom values, the IC behavior and the runtime were
        already aligned in passing in the property owner, which is the JSProxy's
        target. This patch aligns our IC behavior to match our runtime behavior.
        
        This patch also renames some of the registers in the IC code to clear
        up what they're used for.
        
        This is a 2.5x speedup on the microbenchmark I've added, and a 15-20% speedup
        on JetStream2's 3d-cube-SP.

        At the bottom of ScriptExecutable::newCodeBlockFor(), it calls:
            RELEASE_AND_RETURN(throwScope, FunctionCodeBlock::create(vm, executable, unlinkedCodeBlock, scope));

        However, ScriptExecutable::newCodeBlockFor() has 2 return values: a CodeBlock*,
        and a passed in Exception*& that needs to be set if there's an exception.
        FunctionCodeBlock::create() is capable of returning a null CodeBlock* because
        CodeBlock::finishCreation() can throw exceptions.  As a result, we have a scenario
        here where ScriptExecutable::newCodeBlockFor() can return a null CodeBlock* without
        setting the Exception*& result.

        Consequently, Interpreter::executeCall() is relying on this and can end up
        crashing while dereferencing a null CodeBlock* because the exception result was
        not set.

        This patch fixes ScriptExecutable::newCodeBlockFor() to set the exception result.

        [JSC] JSFinalObject::finishCreation's ASSERT has stale condition
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215317

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        JSFinalObject::finishCreation assumes that there is no out-of-line property storage (inline storage capacity == total storage capacity).
        But this is wrong when passing Butterfly* parameter to JSFinalObject. Previously, this feature is not used and we instead used JSObject::createRawObject,
        which bypasses this assertion. But now, we start using this when creating an object for MaterializeNewObject in DFG and FTL, and then we hit the crash
        because this assertion does not consider about non-nullptr butterfly.

        This patch makes create function explicit by introducing `JSFinalObject::createWithButterfly`, which is similar to JSArray::createWithButterfly.
        And we fix the assertion by checking butterfly existence. By renaming JSFinalObject::create to JSFinalObject::createWithButterfly when getting butterfly,
        this patch also clarifies that only MaterializeNewObject related functions, which were using JSObject::createRawObject to bypass this assertion, is passing
        butterfly.

        [JSC] Speculate children first in DFG NewArray
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215308
        <rdar://problem/64749263>

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        SpeculativeJIT::emitAllocateRawObject can create uninitialized butterfly since we later fill them.
        However, DFG NewArray node has speculation after that. So if speculation failure happens, we release
        half-baked butterfly.

        Let's see the example.

           8459         emitAllocateRawObject(resultGPR, structure, storageGPR, numElements, vectorLengthHint);
           ...
           8482             case ALL_INT32_INDEXING_TYPES:
           8483             case ALL_CONTIGUOUS_INDEXING_TYPES: {
           8484                 JSValueOperand operand(this, use, ManualOperandSpeculation);
           8485                 JSValueRegs operandRegs = operand.jsValueRegs();
           8486                 if (hasInt32(node->indexingType())) {
           8487                     DFG_TYPE_CHECK(
           8488                         operandRegs, use, SpecInt32Only,
           8489                         m_jit.branchIfNotInt32(operandRegs));
           8490                 }
           8491                 m_jit.storeValue(operandRegs, MacroAssembler::Address(storageGPR, sizeof(JSValue) * operandIdx));
           8492                 break;
           8493             }

        L8487-L8489 is doing speculation check. If it failed, the rest of the butterfly can be filled with garbage. This looks OK since
        it is Int32 butterfly so GC never scans it. However, if have-a-bad-time happens and the array is reachable from the conservative root,
        this half-baked array is converted from Int32 array to ArrayStorage. At that time, since Int32 butterfly should hold JSInt32,
        we store this garbage to ArrayStorage. Later, if conservative root still holds this array, and GC scans this garbage as as JSValue,
        this value confuses GC.

        In this patch, we first perform speculation before creating uninitialized JSArray so that we can ensure that we never exit after
        creating this array until we fill it. This strategy is the same to FTL's NewArray implementation.

        And we also found that emitAllocateRawObject is allocating an object from JSFinalObject space while we use it for JSArray too.
        We should get per-type allocator to ensure JSArray is allocated in its IsoSubspace.

        speculatively assuming fopen doesn't return ENOENT when it fails

        We are getting some crashes in RemoteInspector and this speculatively fixes the crash.
        My guess is that NeverDestroyed<RemoteInspector> calls constructor twice in heavily contended situation:
        WebKit's static does not have thread-safety. If two threads come here at the same time, it is possible that
        constructor is invoked twice. In that case, later constructor will clear members, which involves clearing
        Lock m_mutex field. This makes Lock's invariant broken.
        This patch uses LazyNeverDestroyed and std::call_once to ensure invoking constructor only once.

        CheckpointSideState shoud play nicely with StackOverflowException unwinding.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215114

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch fixes an issue where we the StackVisitor would
        automatically unwind into the first frame before calling into the
        provided functor. As a note, we do this because the first frame is
        not fully initialized at the time we check for stack
        overflow. When this happened we would fail to clear the side state
        causing a memory leak. To fix this the unwind function now clears
        every checkpoint up to and including the call frame containing our
        handler. Some care needs to be taken that we don't clear
        checkpoint side state for other threads, which could happen if
        there are no checkpoints on the current thread and an API
        miggrated us from another thread below the current thread.

        This patch also makes two refacorings. The first is to make the
        checkpoint side state into a stack, which is how we used it
        anyway. The second is that CallFrame::dump and everything associated
        with it is now marked const so we can PointerDump a CallFrame*.

        There was a bug in previous implementation that allows execution of

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214952

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        In the old way of doing things, we would auth the vector pointer before subtracting
        the base from it. Since we never validated the auth, this allowed for a
        potential data-PAC bypass by just repeatedly calling byteOffset in a loop
        and observing the integer result of the operation.
        
        Since byteOffset does no loads/stores, it suffices to just strip the PAC
        bits before doing the subtraction. This eliminates any such attacks like
        the above because the PAC bits are ignored.

        [JSC] Add B3::BottomTupleValue node
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214956
        <rdar://problem/65192877>

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        In B3 strength reduction, we convert B3 values to bottom value based on type after Oops kind, and then they are *typically* removed later.
        While we support bottom values for usual types, we do not have a bottom value for tuple type. So when replaceWithBottom is called, we
        fail to replace Patchpoints producing tuples with bottom values.

        This patch newly adds B3 BottomTupleValue, which is just a BottomValue for tuple. We can extend it to generate arbitrary constant
        tuple values, but for now, we just support bottom tuple values. We add a new node instead of generating patchpoint which generates bottom
        values since BottomTupleValues implementation is simpler: BottomTupleValue just emits bunch of zero clear for Air tmps and Air does everything
        automatically. On the other hand, implementing a patchpoint needs to add code which clears things with zero while checking the ValueRep. And
        since we have Const32, Const64, etc. values, having this kind of value for tuple too is natural. Plus, this design allows us to remove bunch
        of unnecessary instructions after lowering this to Air since Air knows what instructions will be emitted by this BottomTupleValue, and Air
        can remove a lot of zero clear instructions if they are not read later by Extract.

        Let's consider the following case.

            1. Input AbstractValue is saying SpecObjectOther.
            2. We have CheckIsConstant with StringPrototype (which is SpecObjectOther | SpecStringObject in the current SpeculatedType).
            3. We call filterByValue, which filters m_type by SpecObjectOther | SpecStringObject. But the filtered m_type is SpecObjectOther since (2)'s SpeculatedType is broader.
            4. We store the given constant (StringPrototype) to m_value.
            5. This AbstractValue's m_type is SpecObjectOther while its m_value's SpeculatedType is SpecObjectOther | SpecStringObject. Contradiction!

        When setting m_value by filterByValue, we should filter m_value with m_type to ensure that m_value is the expected one.
        This patch also avoid using SpecObjectOther | SpecStringObject for StringPrototype since we can return narrower type for that.

        JSON.parse should not modify non-configurable properties.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163446

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This change implements step 2.c.ii.3 of InternalizeJSONProperty [1], replacing
        put() with defineOwnProperty(). Using the latter fixes JSON.parse() with
        non-configurable (failures are silently ignored; see note in the spec),
        non-writable, and accessor properties, aligning JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        Since it's extremely unlikely for userland `reviver` to remove or redefine the
        next property, a fast path for PropertyAttribute::None attributes is introduced.
        It advances microbenchmarks/json-parse-object-*.js by ~13%.

        Remove ArrayNode::m_optional
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214294

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        m_optional, which dates back to KJS era, means "is this an array with optional trailing comma,
        with elision, or an empty array". It was used by ArrayNode::streamTo() to preserve a trailing
        comma when converting array node to source string, as well as in few other places,
        before ECMA-262 clarified trailing comma in array literals [1].

        Currently, m_optional is used only by ArrayNode::isSimpleArray(), along with m_elision.
        Checking m_elision is enough since trailing comma doesn't add extra `undefined` element.

        This patch completely removes m_optional, speeding up destructuring and function.apply()
        with empty arrays and arrays with trailing commas by ~55% and a factor of 11 respectively.
        Reflect.apply() optimization (https://webkit.org/b/190668) will also benefit from this change.

        Also, this change converts isSpreadExpression() check to an ASSERT (was enabled by r196323).

        Disallow VM entry when doing a VMInquiry.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214624
        <rdar://problem/65915314>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        1. In PropertySlot's constructor, automatically install a DisallowVMEntry scope
           if the passed in internal method type is VMInquiry.  This ensures that we won't
           be able to enter the VM to call JS code while doing the inquiry.  As a result,
           the PropertySlot constructor will now take an optional VM pointer, which is 
           must be passed in in when the internal method type is VMInquiry.

           Note that the handling of attempts to enter the VM depends on
           Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry().

           On Debug build (due to ASSERT_ENABLED), Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry()
           defaults to true and the VM will crash on disallowed entry.
           On Release build, Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry() defaults to false and
           disallow entry attempts into the VM will be treated like calling an empty
           function that returns undefined.  This is not new behavior in this patch, but
           I just want to have a reminder here of how DisallowVMEntry will be enforcing
           no entry into the VM while doing a VMInquiry.

        2. After VMInquiry gets, sometimes the client code wants to do other work that
           do entails entering the VM.  In such cases, we need to reset the PropertySlot's
           disallowVMEntry scope.  Fixed up a few places in client code to do this reset.

        3. Make the DisableVMEntry scope copyable.  At least one place wants to copy 
           PropertySlot, and as a result, will need to copy its embedded DisableVMEntry
           scope as well if installed.

           For DisableVMEntry, we'll handle copying semantics as follows: copying a
           DisableVMEntry will ref the VM::disallowVMEntryCount.  The count will be
           decremented when both instances are destructed.  As a result, VM entry will
           be disallowed as long as one of the copies are still alive.

        4. For the setObjectToStringValue() method of Structure and StructureRareData, we
           were previously passing a PropertySlot by copy.  We don't really need to do
           this.  Ultimately, only StructureRareData::setObjectToStringValue() needs to
           access a few of the PropertySlot query methods.  So, we changed these methods
           to pass a `const PropertySlot&` instead to void the needless copying.

        Simplify DisallowScope, DisallowGC, and DisallowVMReentry implementations.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214539
        <rdar://problem/65795729>

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Previously, DisallowScope needed to support enabling and disabling.  This was
        only needed to enable the implementation of ObjectInitializationScope.  Now, we
        can make the DisallowGC and DisallowVMReentry inside ObjectInitializationScope
        optional with WTF::Optional.  With that we can simplify these scopes and make
        them true RAII scope objects.

        This patch also does the following:

        1. Renamed DisallowVMReentry to DisallowVMEntry.
           The scope can be used to disable VM entry completely.  There's no need to
           restrict it to only re-entries.

        2. Enforcement of DisallowVMReentry is now done in the LLInt's doVMEntry() instead
           of the VMEntryScope's constructor.  This is a stronger guarantee.

           If Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry() is true, the VM will crash if it sees
           an attempt to enter the VM while disallowed.

           If Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry() is false, an attempt to call into the VM
           while disallowed will return immediately with an undefined result without
           invoking any script.

           By default, Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry() is true if ASSERT_ENABLED is
           true.

        3. Change DisallowScope and DisallowGC to be based on ASSERT_ENABLED instead of NEBUG.

        4. Make DisallowVMEntry always enforceable, not just when ASSERT_ENABLED.
           It's enforcement action depends on Options::crashOnDisallowedVMEntry() as
           described above.

        Theoretically, TryGetById can do the same things GetById does i.e. reify lazy
        properties, read the stack, etc.  Hence, its clobberize rule should be clobberTop
        just like GetById.  However, in practice, we don't currently use @tryGetById to
        access anything on the stack (and probably never will).  But as a conservative
        measure, we'll just treat TryGetById like it can.  In clobberize terms, this
        means we declare TryGetById as doing read(World) (just like GetById) instead of
        read(Heap).

        [ECMA-402] Implement Intl.DisplayNames
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209779

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        This patch implements Intl.DisplayNames behind useIntlDisplayNames=1 flag.
        Intl.DisplayNames can offer readable "display-name" for ICU language, script, region, currency codes.
        For example, it can offer "United States" string for "US" region code.
        We use ICU ULocaleDisplayNames to implement it, except for currency since ULocaleDisplayNames is not supporting
        currency correctly: it ignores "long", "short", and "narrow" style configurations. We need to call ucurr_getName
        directly.

        This patch appropriately adds unicode-language-id parsing in IntlLocale.cpp so that we can validate language id
        when it is passed to `Intl.DisplayNames#of` as defined in the spec.

        Add support for FinalizationRegistries
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199888

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds support for FinalizationRegistries. There are two
        main parts to this patch, the first is refactoring PromiseTimer a
        more general into DeferredWorkTimer. This allows us to finally
        have a "real" setTimeout on the jsc command line. The second part
        is adding all the new classes needed for FinalizationRegistries.

        The refactoring is mostly a rename but does two main new
        things. The first is that it now notifies the VM we have finished
        a synchronuous JS execution, so that WeakRefs can be
        collected. The second is that it now catches any exceptions and
        forwards the to a new method on the global object method
        table. For WebCore, this reports the exception to the console. For
        API users, this calls their exceptionHandler block. For the CLI,
        it exits with exit status 3 (our general exception exit
        status). Unfortunately, there's not currently an ergonomic way to
        pass the expected exception from the CLI arguments to this handler
        so that's not supported here.

        In order to support FinalizationRegistry this patch adds a "new"
        class JSDestructibleInternalFieldObjectImpl, which allows us to
        have a destructible object with internal fields. Since the order
        of collection doesn't matter we currently use C++ HashTables on
        the FinalizationRegistry. Since users can unregister objects while
        the callback is pending we have a hash table for the live entries
        and a second hash table for the dead ones. Lastly, because users
        are not requred to provide a token for unregistration we have two
        extra Vectors containing the live/dead objects that are not
        unregisterible.

        Redefining a property should not change its insertion index (Object.keys order)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142933

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Before this change, JSC used to delete & put back a non-indexed property just to
        update attributes, which was less efficient and corrupted observable property order.

        This patch:
        1. Rewrites validateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor() to closely resemble the spec [1].
        2. Drops property deletion, inlines putDescriptor(), and sets necessary Structure
           flags in attributeChangeTransition().
        3. Simplifies validateAndApplyPropertyDescriptor() a bit by obtaining GetterSetter
           instance from current descriptor rather then calling getDirect().

        This change aligns property order with V8 and SpiderMonkey, advancing provided
        microbenchmarks by 5-85% (especially for objects in dictionary mode).
        SixSpeed, SunSpider, and ARES-6 are all neutral.

        Math.max() can yield the wrong result for max(0, -0).

        The implementations for Math.{max,min} in both DFG and FTL are not

        is not true for normal double arithmetic).

        Beyond tweaking the algorithms used in DFG and FTL we must
        implement the and/or operations on double in MIPS and ARMv7, since

        emitIsUndefined() should not special-case [[IsHTMLDDA]] objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214443

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        According to Annex B [1], there is only a handful of language constructs
        that handle [[IsHTMLDDA]] objects: ToBoolean, abstract equality with `null`
        or `undefined`, and `typeof`. Currently, op_is_undefined does special-case
        masquarader objects, even though it is used beyond `typeof`.

        With this change, emitIsUndefined() produces `=== undefined`, which meets
        developer expectations and the spec for all its usages, while op_is_undefined
        is renamed to op_typeof_is_undefined. New name offers better semantics and
        clearly communicates the op should be avoided when implementing new features.

        Apart from fixing default values with [[IsHTMLDDA]] objects [2], this change
        brings significant speed-up: +50% for function parameters and +20% for
        object destructuring (masqueradesAsUndefinedWatchpoint is not fired).

        This patch also introduces similar emitIsNull() method to avoid breaking
        masquarader object as superclass test262 case.

        WriteBarrier<>::get has a check whether this is not executed when sweeping cells. This is good assertion since
        destruction order of cells are not defined in general, so member cell access from a destructor is almost always wrong.
        But in CodeBlock case, this is OK because (1) CodeBlock destructor accesses UnlinkedCodeBlock and (2) GC ensures that
        CodeBlock gets destroyed before UnlinkedCodeBlock gets destroyed. So this assertion is hit incorrectly.
        In this patch, we use WriteBarrier<>::unvalidatedGet in CodeBlock destructor to bypass the above assertion explicitly.

        [JSC] Introduce JSCTEST_hardTimeout
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214343

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        JSC Debug tests are failing consistently these days, https://build.webkit.org/builders/Apple-Catalina-Debug-JSC-Tests/.
        My guess is that some tests get stuck inside JSC even if timeout occurs. Let's consider the following case.

            1. The test is having `JSC_useConcurrentJIT=0`.
            2. The test is building super heavy FTL code in the main thread.
            3. The timeout thread notifies the VM about the timeout.
            4. But VM does not stop since it is running super heavy FTL compilation.
            5. After 1200 seconds, buildbot terminates the entire test.

        In the above case, JSC gets stuck, and eventually buildbot terminates.
        In this patch, we introduce JSCTEST_hardTimeout. After soft-timeout (usual timeout) happens, we wait another JSCTEST_hardTimeout seconds.
        And if the JSC shell is not finished, we forcefully terminates the JSC shell via exit(EXIT_FAILURE), to avoid entire JSC test termination
        in buildbot.

        We pick 300 seconds. This means, after soft-timeout occurs, we wait for 5 mins, and if the JSC shell is still active, kill it. 5 mins sounds
        reasonable amount of time. And this should fit within buildbot's hard timeout (1200 seconds).

        false for BigInt32 AbstractValue. This patch fixes that filter. And we also reviewed places
        using isCellOrMisc / isNotCellOrMisc.

        Clean up SourceProvider and add caller relative load script to jsc.cpp
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214205

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch originally was just to add an optional parameter to our
        load function so that any relative path is computed with respect
        to calling script.  Rather than computing the path relative to the
        current working directory. The main advantage of this is now you
        can run all the JSTests/stress scripts from anywhere rather than
        only from the stress directory. This also matches jsc.cpp's module
        loader implementation.

        To make this possible a surprising number of changes were
        needed. Specifically, it was much easier to get this to work if we
        converted SourceOrigin's url to a WTF::URL rather than just a
        WTF::String. At the same time it became clear that
        SourceProvider's m_sourceURL is really not a URL but more of a
        file name, which can sometimes be a URL. It's possible that we
        don't need m_sourceURL at all but we should do that in a different
        patch.

        Additionally, jsc.cpp now uses WTF::URL for handling file
        paths. This is cleaner than managing trying to do it ourselves and
        should work across all the ports.

        Lastly, the JSC CLI no longer accepts "bare-name"
        specifiers. i.e. all specifiers must start with "/", "./", or
        "../". This matches what we do in our Obj-C API and in
        WebCore. While fixing tests I also noticed that the error message
        was almost useless since it didn't tell you what the specifier or
        referrer in question so that information is now part of the user
        visible error.

        Intl.Locale#{maximize,minimize} should return Intl.Locale object instead of generated locale string.

        We also add some protection and use jsString instead of jsNontrivialString because it would be still
        possible that ICU's locale recognition and our locale interpretation do not agree each other and ICU
        failed to produce locale, and then the string becomes empty. Since this is a boundary between third-party
        library and JSC, and we are not ensuring our invariant inside third-party library, taking safer path makes
        it better.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        We have an AI based safety checker for LICM, to determine if it's safe to
        hoist nodes. Historically, we've had bugs here, where we allow unsafe
        hoisting. In practice, we've been saved by safety checks also being hoisted
        at the same time as the operation they're protecting, so even if we
        have bugs in AI-based safeToExecute, things usually just work. Since
        we've had security bugs here before, where the safety checks don't get hoisted,
        leading to issues, it's helpful if we can fuzz this area.  This patch implements
        a way to says we won't hoist a node based on some probability, allowing us to play
        with what does and doesn't get hoisted.

        Bytecode UseDef should be aware of checkpoints
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213566

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Previously, we tried to solve teaching DFG about uses and defs of
        locals across checkpoints by asking what locals were def'd at some
        checkpoint. However, this was subtly wrong because we couldn't
        report any uses at subsequent checkpoints so DFG thought the
        local was dead immediately after its birth.

        This patch reverts that change and instead teaches BytecodeUseDef
        about checkpoints. Right now, BytecodeUseDef only knows about
        locals at checkpoints but in the future we may teach it about tmps
        at well.

        Since the vectors containing our liveness bitmaps were already
        sparse (they are indexed by the bytecode offset) we can reuse the
        gaps to hold our checkpoint liveness information. To make sure we
        don't overlap between the next bytecode and a checkpoint for the
        current bytecode there is now a static assert that the length of
        the bytecode is greater than the number of checkpoints. This
        assumption is already true for existing bytecodes with checkpoints (and
        likely to be true for future ones anyway).

        Many of the BytecodeLivenessPropegation functions have been
        renamed to reflect that they operate over the full instruction,
        including checkpoints, rather than just the BytecodeIndex passed.

        Lastly, this patch makes a speculative fix to forAllKilledOperands where we
        wouldn't report that all tmps die at the end of each bytecode. I can't think
        of a case where this would break things but it's probably good hygiene.

        This patch:

        1. Implements step 3 of {Array,%TypedArray%}.prototype.indexOf [1] and
           %TypedArray%.prototype.lastIndexOf [2] since it is observable when
           second argument is an object with userland toString() or valueOf() method.
           Advances provided microbenchmark by 100% for Array and by 25% for %TypedArray%.

        2. Removes argument count check from %TypedArray%.prototype.{indexOf,lastIndexOf},
           allowing these methods to be invoked w/o arguments. The spec treats missing
           arguments as `undefined`, always returning -1 for typed arrays.

        Both changes align JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        ConservativeRoots should mark any cell it finds an interior pointer to
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213686

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Currently, if ConserativeRoots finds an interior pointer to a cell
        it will only mark that cell if it's a butterfly of some
        kind. However, this can cause problems if the C++ or B3 compilers
        pre-compute the offset of some cell member they want to load from
        after a call. If this happens and that interior pointer is the
        only reference to the cell it can get collected while it is still
        "alive".

        A naive patch that doesn't return from
        findGCObjectPointersForMarking after finding a live non-interior,
        non-butterfly cell was a 2% regression on Speedometer2 and
        JetStream2. So, this patch immediately returns after
        marking some non-butterfly cell, which appears to have fixed the
        regression locally. Given this was such a big regression (likely
        from running MarkedBlock::isLive) more than once there's possibly
        an optimization opportunity here. I filed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213687 to investigate
        further.

        JSCell constructor needs to ensure that the passed in structure is still alive.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213593
        <rdar://problem/64597573>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Note that in the initializer list of the `JSCell(VM&, Structure*)` constructor,
        we are only using values inside the passed in structure but not necessarily the
        structure pointer itself.  All these values are contained inside Structure::m_blob.
        Note also that this constructor is an inline function.  Hence, the compiler may
        choose to pre-compute the address of structure->m_blob and discard the structure
        pointer itself.

        Here's an example:

            0x10317a21e <+1054>: movq   0x18(%rsp), %rdx  // rdx:vm = &vm
            0x10317a223 <+1059>: addq   $0x8, %r13        // r13 = &structure.m_blob  <== pre-compute address of m_blob !!!
                                                          // r13 previously contained the structure pointer.
                                                          // Now, there's no more references to the structure base address.

            0x10317a227 <+1063>: leaq   0x48(%rdx), %rdi  // arg0:heap = &vm.heap
            0x10317a22b <+1067>: movl   $0x10, %edx       // arg2:size = 16.
            0x10317a230 <+1072>: movq   %rdi, 0x28(%rsp)
            0x10317a235 <+1077>: xorl   %esi, %esi        // arg1:deferralContext = 0
            0x10317a237 <+1079>: callq  0x10317ae60       // call JSC::allocateCell<JSC::JSArray>  <== Can GC here !!!

            0x10317a23c <+1084>: movq   %rax, %rbx        // rbx:cell = rax:allocation result.
            ...
            0x10317a253 <+1107>: movl   (%r13), %eax      // eax = m_blob.structureID  <== Use pre-computed m_blob address here.

        There's a chance that the GC may run while allocating this cell.  In the event
        that the structure is newly instantiated just before calling this constructor, 
        there may not be any other references to it.  As a result, the structure may get
        collected before the cell is even constructed.  To avoid this possibility, we need
        to ensure that the structure pointer is still alive by the time this constructor
        is called.

        I am not committing any tests for this issue because the test cases relies on:

        1. Manually forcing an O3 ASan Release build.

        2. Not running jsc with --useDollarVM=1.  Note: the JSC test harness automatically
           adds --useDollarVM=1 for all test runs.

        3. Memory being allocated in a specific order.  The recent Bitmap FreeList change
           enabled this issue to manifest.  The old linked list FreeList implementation
           would have hidden the issue.

        4. Adding some logging code can also make the issue stop manifesting.

        In short, the test cases will not detect any regression even if we commit them
        because the existing automatic regression test runs will not have the necessary
        conditions for reproducing the issue.  The tests are also somewhat fragile where
        any changes in memory layout may stop the issue from manifesting in an observable
        way.

        Add DFG/FTL fast path for GetPrototypeOf based on OverridesGetPrototype flag
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213191

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch:

        1. Introduces `loadInlineOffset` LLInt macro (64-bit only) and utilizes it in
           `get_prototype_of` since we assert that `knownPolyProtoOffset` is an inline offset.

        2. Brings baseline JIT fast path to 32-bit builds, progressing `super-getter.js`
           microbenchmark by a factor of 10 (w/o DFG).

        3. Adds GetPrototypeOf DFG/FTL fast paths that leverage OverridesGetPrototype type
           info flag, advancing provided rare objects microbenchmark by ~46% (~37% w/o FTL).
           Also, cleans up existing DFG fast path by using AssemblyHelpers::loadValue().

        4. Extracts AssemblyHelpers::emitLoadPrototype() and uses it in baseline JIT, DFG, and
           InstanceOfGeneric access case. With this change, `instanceof` access case handles all
           [[GetPrototypeOf]] overrides (before: only Proxy objects), which is more correct, yet
           not observable enough to provide a test case. `instanceof` microbenchmarks are neutral.

        Unify Bitmap math loops in MarkedBlock::Handle::specializedSweep().

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset and Saam Barati.

        This change appears to be performance neutral.  However, we'll take the change
        because we know that it does less work, and the new way of expressing the Bitmap
        math in MarkedBlock::Handle::specializedSweep() does appear to be easier to
        understand than the old code.

        Also addressed feedback from Robin and Saam in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213071.

        Changes made:

        1. Use the new Bitmap::words() API to get direct access to the underlying bits
           storage.  With this, we can do the merging of the marked and newlyAllocated
           bits with a single pass looping thru the bitmap words.

        2. In MarkedBlock::Handle::specializedSweep()'s Bitmap free list code, moved the
           implementation of handleDeadCells lambda down to the call to freeAtoms.forEachSetBit()
           because this is the only place it is used.

        3. Fixed MarkedBlock::Handle::specializedSweep()'s Bitmap free list code to
           handle the dead cells unconditionally.  This condition check was wrongly
           adapted from the linked list implementation where handleDeadCell() was called
           in 2 places depending on the destruction mode.  With the Bitmap free list,
           there is only once place to handle the dead cells, and it should be executed
           unconditionally.

           This fixes a bug where the FreeList::originalSize() never gets computed if the
           cells in the block does not need destruction.

        4. Renamed FreeList::bitmapRows() to FreeList::bitmapRowsMinusOne().
           Renamed FreeList::offsetOfBitmapRows() to FreeList::offsetOfBitmapRowsMinusOne().

        5. Also fixed some typos in comments.

        Replace JSC::FreeList linked list with a Bitmap.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213071

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Implement an alternative to the linked list FreeList.  This alternative uses
        a Bitmap to record which atom in the block is available for allocation.

        The intuition here is that allocation using the Bitmap implementation will do:
            2 loads - m_currentRowBitmap, m_currentMarkedBlockRowAddress
            1 store - m_currentRowBitmap

        whereas the linked list implementation will do:
            3 loads - m_scrambledHead, m_secret, result->scrambledNext
            1 store - m_scrambledHead

        and result->scrambledNext is from a different region of code and therefore not
        in the same cache line.

        The downside of the Bitmap implementation is that it uses more instructions.

        This change is currently only enabled for x86_64, which shows about a 0.8%
        progression on Speedometer 2.

        It appears to be about a 1% regression on ARM64E.  Hence, for now, we keep the
        linked list implementation for ARM64 builds.

        This is how the Bitmap FreeList works:

        1. The Bitmap implementation only replaces the linked list implementation.  It
           does not replace the bump allocator.

        2. The Bitmap allocator keeps a m_bitmap that is initialized in
           MarkedBlock::Handle::specializedSweep() to have a bit set for each atom
           location that is available for allocation (i.e. is free).  Note that a cell
           is usually allocated using more than 1 atom.  Only the bit corresponding to
           the first atom (in that cell length range of free atoms) will be set.

           This is consistent with how bits in MarkedBlock::Footer::m_marks and
           MarkedBlock::Footer::m_newlyAllocated are set i.e. only the bit for the first
           atom in the cell can be set.

        3. The allocation algorithm thinks of the MarkedBlock as consisting of rows
           of atoms, where the number of atoms in a row equals the number of bits in
           a AtomsBitmap::Word.  On 64-bit CPUs, this would be 64.

           We will start allocating from the last (highest numbered) row down to the
           first (row 0).  As we allocate, we will only update m_currentRowIndex and
           m_currentRowBitmap.  m_bitmap will not be updated.  This is so in order to
           reduce the number of instructions executed during an allocation.

           When m_currentRowIndex points to N, the AtomsBitmap::Word for row N in
           m_bitmap will have been copied into m_currentRowBitmap.  This is the row
           that we will be allocating from until the row is exhausted.

           This is how we know whether an atom is available for allocation or not:
             i. Atoms in any rows above m_currentRowIndex are guaranteed to be
                allocated already (because we allocate downwards), and hence, are not
                available.
            ii. For row m_currentRowIndex, m_currentRowBitmap is the source of truth
                on which atoms in the row are available for allocation.
           iii. For rows below m_currentRowIndex, m_bitmap is the source of truth on
                which atoms are available for allocation.

           When m_currentRowIndex reaches 0, the info in m_bitmap is completely
           obsoleted, and m_currentRowBitmap holds the availability info for row 0.
           When both m_currentRowIndex and m_currentRowBitmap are 0, then we have
           completely exhausted the block and no more atoms are available for
           allocation.

        4. Allocation happens in 3 paths: fast, middle, slow.

           The fast path checks m_currentRowBitmap.  If it's not 0, then we compute the
           bit number of the lowest set bit in it.  That bit number will be used together
           with m_currentMarkedBlockRowAddress to compute the address of the atom
           location available for allocation.  m_currentRowBitmap will be updated to clear
           the bit for the atom that has just ben allocated.

           If m_currentRowBitmap is 0, then we'll go to the middle path.

           The middle path checks m_currentRowIndex to see if we have more rows to allocate
           from.  For each m_currentRowIndex, we check its corresponding AtomsBitmap::Word
           in m_bitmap.  If the word is non-zero, we copy it to m_currentRowBitmap and
           jump to the fast path to do the allocation.  The middle path will update
           m_currentRowIndex to point to the current row we're allocating from.

           If we have decremented m_currentRowIndex down to 0 but still can't find a
           non-zero AtomsBitmap::Word in m_bitmap, then the block has been exhausted, and
           we'll go to the slow path.

           The slow path is analogous to the old slow path i.e. we try to refill the
           LocalAllocator with a new MarkedBlock.

        5. On the layout of fields in FreeList (see changes in FreeList.h), we try to
           preserve the positions of the bump allocator fields.  The only change we made
           there is in the location of m_cellSize.  It is now moved up next to m_remaining,
           and m_originalSize is moved down.  This is because m_originalSize is only
           accessed in the slow path, and m_cellSize is accessed in the bump allocation
           path.

           Next, we try to put Bitmap allocation fields where the linked list fields
           would have been.  The one bit of trickiness is that we'll put
           m_currentMarkedBlockRowAddress in a union with m_payloadEnd.  This is because
           m_payloadEnd is only used in the bump allocation path.  If m_remaining is 0,
           then we can reuse this location for m_currentMarkedBlockRowAddress.

           With this, we would have 4 bytes of padding after m_currentRowIndex.  For
           compactness, we put m_originalSize there in that space.  For builds that use
           the linked list implementation, m_originalSize will be located below after
           m_cellSize.

        With Clang, the ensureStillAliveHere() happened to do what I expected, but with

        [JSC] Check NullSetterFunction under strict-mode context since structure / PropertyCondition are unaware of this
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213266

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Our PropertyCondition is tracking the shape of Structure. This is enough for IC except for one case: throwing an error when invoking null setters in strict code.

            "use strict";
            var object = { get value() { return 42; } }
            object.value = 42;

        In the above case, we need to throw an error. Let's consider the following scenario.

            1. Object has valid setter.
            2. IC is buffering OPC which includes (1)'s object in [[Prototype]] hit.
            3. IC commits buffered AccessCase with OPC. And PropertyCondition says Object + setter-offset => Presence.
            4. Object deletes its setter.
            5. Just after (4), DFG concurrently reads buffered committed OPCs.
            6. DFG see that PropertyCondition is valid even after (4) since accessor property does exist.
            7. Set up DFG sequence `GetSetter, Call`.
            8. DFG calls null-setter under strict code, which is not assumed to be called.

        In this patch, we insert NullSetterFunction check before setter invocation under strict mode. In IC, if we see NullSetterFunction,
        we replace the calling target with special function which throws an error. In DFG / FTL, we emit `CheckNotJSCast` DFG node which
        ensures that this setter is not null setter.

        In IC code, we already have null-setter checking code before. So this change does not have any impact in terms of performance.
        In DFG / FTL code, we only insert this check when we do not inline this setter. This is because inlining emits `CheckCell` anyway so
        we can know that this is not NullSetterFunction. And this means that DFG Call opcode exists after CheckNotJSCast. Since Call opcode
        loads the fields of call target anyway, this also does not affect on performance.

        Make Options::useJIT() be the canonical source of truth on whether we should use the JIT.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212556
        <rdar://problem/63780436>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        After r263055, Options::useJIT() always equals VM::canUseJIT() after canUseJIT()
        has been computed.  This patch removes VM::canUseJIT(), and replaces all calls to
        it with calls to Options::useJIT().

        In the old code, VM::canUseJIT() would assert s_canUseJITIsSet to ensure that
        its clients will not access s_canUseJIT before it is initialized.  We not have an
        equivalent mechanism with Options.  This is how it works:

        1. There are 2 new Options flags in the g_jscConfig:
                g_jscConfig.options.isFinalized
                g_jscConfig.options.allowUnfinalizedAccess

           g_jscConfig.options.isFinalized means that all Options values are finalized
           i.e. initialization is complete and ready to be frozen in the Config.

           g_jscConfig.options.isFinalized is set by initializeThreading() by calling
           Options::finalize() once options initialization is complete.

           g_jscConfig.options.allowUnfinalizedAccess is an allowance for clients to
           access Options values before they are finalized.  This is only needed in
           options initialization code where Options values are read and written to.

           g_jscConfig.options.allowUnfinalizedAccess is set and cleared using the
           Options::AllowUnfinalizedAccessScope RAII object.  The few pieces of code that
           do options initialization will instantiate this scope object.

        2. All Options accessors (e.g. Option::useJIT()) will now assert that either
           g_jscConfig.options.allowUnfinalizedAccess or g_jscConfig.options.isFinalized
           is set.

        3. Since r263055, Options::recomputeDependentOptions() ensures that if useJIT() is
           false, all other JIT options (e.g. useBaselineJIT(), useDFTJIT(), useFTLJIT(),
           etc.) are also false.  This patch also adds useBBQJIT() and useOMGJIT() to that
           list.

           With this, checks for useJIT() are now redundant if there's also another JIT
           option check, e.g. useRegExpJIT() or useDFGJIT().  When redundant, this patch
           elides the useJIT() check (which used to be a VM::canUseJIT() check).

        Ideally, we should also introduce a separate abstraction for requested option
        values before finalization than the finalized option values that will be adopted
        by the system.  We'll do this as a separate exercise in a later patch.

        (main):
        - move the call to testExecutionTimeLimit() to after finalizeMultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest()
          returns.  This is because testExecutionTimeLimit() modifies JIT options at runtime
          as part of its testing.  This can wreak havoc on the rest of the system that expects
          the options to be frozen.  Ideally, we'll find a way for testExecutionTimeLimit() to
          do its work without changing JIT options, but that is not easy to do.  For now,
          we'll just run it at the end as a workaround.

        Optimize Air::TmpWidth analysis in IRC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152478

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        AirTmpWidth currently uses a HashMap to map tmps to their width.
        Since tmps have consecutive indices, we can instead use vectors (one for GP and one for FP tmps).
        As a bonus, we can just compute the width of the tmps of the bank the register allocator is currently looking at.
        This cuts the time spent in the register allocator in JetStream2 by about 100ms out of 3.4s
        (or sometimes 80ms out of 2.4, the bimodality of the time spent is due to a huge function in tagcloud-SP which usually but not always reach the FTL, I'll check later if it can be fixed by tweaking the inliner).

        VMTraps is only needed for JITted code.  Hence, if the JIT is disabled, we should
        set Options::usePollingTraps() to true to indicate that we won't be using VMTraps.

        With this change, we no longer install any signal handling machinery if
        Options::useJIT() is false.

        Because we may still disable the JIT even if useJIT() is true (due to failure to
        allocate JIT memory or a number of other factors), we will also add a check of
        VM::canUseJIT() in initializeThreading(), and disable useJIT() if needed.  Of

        CheckIsConstant should not use BadCache exit kind
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213141

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        The BadCache exit kind causes the OSR exit compilers to try to
        update ArrayProfiles.  This is just incorrect for CheckIsConstant
        since the node's origin may not even have an
        ArrayProfile... BadCache also strongly assumes the value it's
        profiling is a cell, which is clearly not always the case for
        CheckIsConstant.

        CheckIsConstant now uses the BadConstantValue (BadValue conflicts
        with macros exported by X11 on GTK) exit kind for all use kinds,
        which is just a rename of BadCell.  All existing places where we
        can emit a CheckIsConstant already have a story for BadConstantValue.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch fixes various issues when running JSC on arm64_32 with
        useJIT=1 and useBaselineJIT=0. In particular this patch makes the
        following changes:

        1) ScalePtr is now just part of the Scale enum and is set based on
        the size of the address space.

        2) MacroAssembler::*Ptr functions call 32/64 bit variants based on
        Address space size rather than cpu architecture. Vetting of callsites
        using Ptr as 64 will happen in future patches since it's hard to
        comprehensively vet.

        3) Add some missing variants of functions for when pointers are 32-bit.

        4) Add a load/storeReg function that stores a full register regardless
        of pointer size for storing/loading callee saves.

        5) numberOfDFGCompiles should report a big number for
        useBaselineJIT=0 as some tests fail by default if useBaselineJIT=0
        but useJIT=1.

        6) Assert BaseIndex has a scale of PtrSize or TimesOne (for pre-scaled
        values) when passed to a load/storePtr function.

        This patch introduces get_prototype_of bytecode, ensuring returned values
        are profiled so the op can be wired to existing DFG and FTL implementations.
        In order to avoid performance regression w/o DFG (__proto__ is optimized via

        Reviewed by Devin Rousso.

        There were two minor issues here that interacted:
        - emitThrowReferenceError did not take an optional `dst` argument like everything else, and instead always returned a new temporary.
          As a result, the various functions that sometimes did "return emitThrowReferenceError(..);" could return a different RegisterID than the one
          provided to them through `dst`, breaking the invariant stated at the top of the file.
        - ShortCircuitReadModifyResolveNode::emitBytecode used the result of such a function, unnecessarily, and (correctly) relied on the invariant being upheld.
        The combination of these led to the bytecode trying to do a move of a temporary that was only defined in one of the predecessors of the basic block it was on,
        which was caught by validateBytecode.

        I fixed both issues, and verified that either fix is enough to stop the bug.
        I fixed the first because other code may depend on that invariant in more subtle ways.
        I fixed the second because it was just unnecessary complexity and made the code misleading.

        I also reworded the comment at the top of NodesCodegen.cpp based on Keith's explanation and Mark's advice to make it less cryptic.

        Linear Scan uses the wrong Interval for spills for tmps with roles of early def or late use
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213055
        <rdar://problem/59874018>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        There was a bug in linear scan when computing the live range interval for
        spill tmps that had early defs or late uses.  When linear scan spills a
        tmp, it creates a new tmp that it loads to and stores from, and replaces the old tmp
        with the new tmp, and emits stores/loads around pertinent instructions. The live
        interval for such tmps is small by nature, it's contained in the interval for the
        instruction itself. However, we'd build this interval purely based off the
        original tmp's arg timing. So, for example, let's consider a program like this:
        
        RandoInsn: LateUse:Tmp1, Use:Tmp2, [early = N, late = N+1]
        Let's say that Tmp1's last use is RandoInsn, and it had a def before
        RandoInsn, therefore, its live range will be something like:
        [J where J < N, N+1]
        
        and now imagine we spilled Tmp1 for some reason, and rewrote the
        program to be:
        Move Addr(spill for Tmp1), TmpSpill
        RandoInsn: LateUse:TmpSpill, Use:Tmp2, [early = N, late = N+1]
        
        We used to incorrectly mark the live range for TmpSpill to just be [N+1, N+2).
        However, the bug here is that we neglected that TmpSpill actually had an earlier
        def at [N, N+1). So, the live range for TmpSpill was wrong. This could incorrectly
        lead us to allocate Tmp2 and TmpSpill to the same register, since their live
        ranges may not intersect if Tmp2 dies at RandoInsn.
        
        We also had the symmetric bug for EarlyDefs: we wouldn't account for the
        store-spill that'd happen after something like RandoInsn.
        
        The fix is to account for the loads/stores of spill tmps when assigning
        them a live range.
        
        This patch contains a standalone test in testair. It also fixes crashes we had when
        running B3O1 tests using typed arrays on arm64e since we had patchpoints that utilized

        [JSC] Return DisposableCallSiteIndex when destroying GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213069
        <rdar://problem/64205186>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Inside GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler::observeZeroRefCount, we are returning DisposableCallSiteIndex to freelist.
        However, GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler::observeZeroRefCount can be called even if the code of GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler is
        on the stack. Let's consider the following scenario.

            1. Execute GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler's code. Set CallSiteIndex to the stack.
            2. Execute more code. (1)'s GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler's code is on the stack.
            3. (1)'s GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler's refcount becomes zero.
            4. CallSiteIndex of GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler is returned.
            5. Execute StackVisitor to construct frames. But we cannot find CodeOrigin corresponding to CallSiteIndex stored in (1) since it is already returned.

        DisposableCallSiteIndex should be returned after ensuring that GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler's code is not on the stack. Detecting this is the functionality
        what GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler can offer. It is destroyed after ensuring that GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler's code is not on the stack.

        This patch delays DisposableCallSiteIndex returning until we destroy owner GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler. But it is possible that CodeBlock* corresponding to
        GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler is already destroyed. To avoid this condition, we extract CodeOrigins vector as Ref<DFG::CodeOriginPool> and keep it alive from
        GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler too. And since CodeOrigin addition / removal happens only from the main thread after finishing the compilation, and
        GCAwareJITStubRoutineWithExceptionHandler's destructor is called from the Heap's finalizer, which must be executed from the main thread, we can just modify it without a lock.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch makes RegExp.prototype getters throw TypeError when called on
        RegExp.prototype object from another realm, aligning JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        The spec [1] allows same-realm access to avoid breaking the web, while makes
        RegExp.prototype an ordinary object (rather than RegExp instance) where possible.

        addMissingScriptLocales was removed from IntlObject when changing our locale resolution to depend more directly

        ICU 65+ does have uloc_openAvailableByType which will do the trick, so perhaps we should use this in the future,
        but it still doesn't seem to help us with Collator, which has its own separate set of "available locales".

        https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/159

        In r262727, I suggested that Alexey Shvayka add an assertion in

        a client may be doing the recursing before calling Stringifier::appendStringifiedValue().
        As a result, Stringifier::appendStringifiedValue() ends up being executed with
        the stack pointer already in the reserved zone.  This is legal, and is what the
        reserved zone is intended for as long as we don't recurse from here.  However,
        this also means that asserting vm.isSafeToRecurseSoft() here will surely fail
        because we are already in the reserved zone area.  The fix is simply to remove
        this faulty assertion.

        Disambiguate the OverridesGetPropertyNames structure flag
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212909
        <rdar://problem/63823557>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Previously, the OverridesGetPropertyNames structure flag could mean 2 different
        things:
        1. the getPropertyNames() method is overridden, or
        2. any of the forms of getPropertyName() is overridden:
           getPropertyName, getOwnPropertyNames, getOwnNonIndexPropertyNames

        Some parts of the code expects one definition while other parts expect the other.
        This patch disambiguates between the 2 by introducing OverridesAnyFormOfGetPropertyNames
        for definition (2).  OverridesGetPropertyNames now only means definition (1).

        Note: we could have implemented overridesGetPropertyNames() by doing a comparison
        of the getPropertyNames pointer in the MethodTable.  This is a little slower than
        checking a TypeInfo flag, but probably doesn't matter a lot in the code paths
        where overridesGetPropertyNames() is called.  However, we have bits in TypeInfo
        left.  So, we'll might as well use it.

        This ambiguity resulted in JSObject::getPropertyNames() recursing infinitely
        when it didn't think it could recurse.  This is demonstrated in
        JSTests/stress/unexpected-stack-overflow-below-JSObject-getPropertyNames.js as
        follows:

        1. The test case invokes JSObject::getPropertyNames on a JSArray.

        2. In the while loop at the bottom of JSObject::getPropertynames(), we check
           `if (prototype->structure(vm)->typeInfo().overridesGetPropertyNames()) {`.

        3. The test overrides proto as follows:
           `arg0.__proto__ = arr1` where both arg0 and arr1 are JArrays.

        4. In the old code, JSArray sets OverridesGetPropertyNames but does not override
           getPropertyNames().  It actually meant to set OverridesAnyFormOfGetPropertyNames
           (after we disambiguated it) because JSArray overrides getOwnNonIndexPropertyNames().

        5. When we get to the check at (2), we ask if the prototype overridesGetPropertyNames().
           Since JSArray sets OverridesGetPropertyNames, the answer is yes / true.

           JSObject::getPropertynames() then proceeds to invoke
           `prototype->methodTable(vm)->getPropertyNames(prototype, globalObject, propertyNames, mode);`

           But because JSArray does not actually overrides getPropertyNames(), we're
           actually invoking JSObject::getPropertyNames() here.  Viola!  Infinite loop.

        With this patch, JSArray is disambiguated to set OverridesAnyFormOfGetPropertyNames
        instead of OverridesGetPropertyNames, and this infinite loop no longer exists.

        This patch also made the following changes:

        1. Templatized TypeInfo::isSetOnFlags1() and TypeInfo::isSetOnFlags2() so that
           we can used static_asserts instead of a debug ASSERT to verify the integrity of
           the flag we're checking against.

        2. Added a Structure::validateFlags() called from the Structure constructor.
           validateFlags() will verify the following:
           a. OverridesGetOwnPropertySlot must be set in the flags if getOwnPropertySlot
              is overridden in the MethodTable.
           b. InterceptsGetOwnPropertySlotByIndexEvenWhenLengthIsNotZero must be set in
              the flags if getOwnPropertySlotByIndex is overridden in the MethodTable.
           c. HasPutPropertySecurityCheck must be set in the flags if doPutPropertySecurityCheck
              is overridden in the MethodTable.
           d. OverridesGetPropertyNames must be set in the flags if getPropertyNames
              is overridden in the MethodTable.
           e. OverridesAnyFormOfGetPropertyNames must be set in the flags if any of
              getPropertyNames, getOwnPropertyNames, or getOwnNonIndexPropertyNames are
              overridden in the MethodTable.

           An alternate solution would be to automatically set these flags if we detect
           their corresponding methods are overridden.  However, this alternate solution
           requires this laundry list to be checked every time a structure is constructed.
           The current implementation of having the required flags already pre-determined
           as a constant is more efficient in terms of performance and code space.

           Also, it only takes one instantiation of the structure to verify that the flags
           are valid.  Since we only write JSCell / JSObject classes when we need them
           and we always write tests to exercise new code (especially such classes), we're
           guaranteed the flags validation will be exercised.

        3. Made JSObject::getOwnPropertySlot() and JSObject::doPutPropertySecurityCheck()
           not inlined when ASSERT_ENABLED.  This is needed in order for Structure::validateFlags()
           to do its checks using function pointer comparisons.  Otherwise, the inline
           functions can result in multiple instantiations of these functions.  For
           example, WebCore can get its own copy of JSObject::getOwnPropertySlot() and
           the comparisons will think the function is overridden even when it's not.

        4. Structure::validateFlags() found the following problems which are now fixed:

           GetterSetter was not using its StructureFlags.  As a result, it was missing the
           OverridesGetOwnPropertySlot flag.

           JSDataView did not define its StructureFlags.  It was missing the
           OverridesGetOwnPropertySlot and OverridesAnyFormOfGetPropertyNames flags.

        5. Changed a TypeInfo constructor to not have a default argument for the flags value.
           Also grepped for all uses of this constructor to make sure that it is passed
           the StructureFlags field.  This exercise found the following issue:

           JSAPIValueWrapper was not using its StructureFlags when creating its structure.
           Previously, it was just ignoring the StructureIsImmortal flag in StructureFlags.

        6. Hardened the assertions for hasReadOnlyOrGetterSetterPropertiesExcludingProto()
           and hasGetterSetterProperties() in the Structure constructor.

           Previously, if the flag is set, it verifies that the ClassInfo has the
           appropriate data expected by the flag.  However, it does not assert the reverse
           i.e. that if the ClassInfo data exists, then the flag must also be set.
           The new assertions now checks both.

           Moved the overridesGetCallData() assertion into Structure::validateFlags()
           because it concerns the OverridesGetCallData flag.  This assertion has also
           ben hardened.

        This patch adds a heuristic to avoid trying to compute the CodeBlockHash on

        check and, if needed, computing the hash with an alternate method.

        This is OK to do because:
        1. CodeBlockHash is not a critical hash.
        2. In practice, reasonable source code are not that long.
        3. And if they are that long, then we are still diversifying the hash on their
           length. But if they do collide, it's OK.

        The only invariant here is that we should always produce the same hash for the
        same source string.  Since the algorithm is deterministic, this invariant is not

        This audit found one interesting case for DOMJIT nodes. We emit safety checks
        for CallDOM/CallDOMGetter inside fixup phase and the bytecode parser. When
        determining if these nodes are safe to execute, we need to also ensure that
        these checks hold.
        
        I've also added a helper to JSDollarVM to ensure that this patch doesn't break
        LICM of DOMJIT.
        
        This patch also moves some nodes we will never hoist to return false.

        [JSC] Add support for private class fields
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206431

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Expanding upon the earlier public class fields patch, we implement the remaining (and
        significant parts) of the instance fields (https://tc39.es/proposal-class-fields/).

        There are a variety of key changes here:

            - Parser now understands the concept of private names (Token PRIVATENAME).
            - 1 new opcode (op_get_private_name), one changed opcode (op_put_by_val_direct).
            - A method for creating Symbol objects with a null PrivateSymbolImpl is exposed as a
              LinkTimeConstant (@createPrivateSymbol).
            - Null Private Symbols are stored by name (not a valid identifier) in a JSScope, and
              are loaded from the outer scope whenever they are used by the modified opcodes.

        The changes to op_put_by_val_direct include a new bytecode operand (PutByValFlags) which are
        used to distinguish between overwriting or defining a new private field. Specifically, when it
        comes to private field accesses, it's necessary to throw an exception when accessing a field
        which does not exist, or when attempting to define a private field which has already been
        defined.

        During the evaluation of a class expression, before the class element list is evaluated (in case
        any computed property names expressions refer to a new private field), a new PrivateSymbol is
        created for each individual private field name, and stored in the class lexical scope.

        Private field names are loaded from scope before their use. This prevents multiple evaluations
        of the same class source from accessing each other's private fields, because the values of the
        symbols loaded from the class scope would be distinct. This is required by the proposal text,
        and is the key reason why we use ByVal lookups rather than ById lookups.

        To illustrate, typical private field access will look like:

        <Field Reads>
        resolve_scope      <scope=>, <currentScope>, "#x", GlobalProperty, 0
        get_from_scope     <symbol=>, <scope>, "#x", 1050624<DoNotThrowIfNotFound|GlobalProperty|NotInitialization>, 0, 0
        get_private_name   <value=>, <receiver --- probably 'this'>, <symbol>

        <Field Writes>
        resolve_scope      <scope=>, <currentScope>, "#x", GlobalProperty, 0
        get_from_scope     <symbol=>, <scope>, "#x", 1050624<DoNotThrowIfNotFound|GlobalProperty|NotInitialization>, 0, 0
        put_by_val_direct  <receiver, probably 'this'>, <symbol>, <value>, <PutByValPrivateName>

        <Field Definition>
        resolve_scope      <scope=>, <currentScope>, "#x", GlobalProperty, 0
        get_from_scope     <symbol=>, <scope>, "#x", 1050624<DoNotThrowIfNotFound|GlobalProperty|NotInitialization>, 0, 0
        put_by_val_direct  <receiver, probably 'this'>, <symbol>, <value>, <PutByValPrivateName|PutByValThrowIfExists>

        The feature is currently hidden behind the feature flag JSC::Options::usePrivateClassFields.

        It will default to on if ASSERT_ENABLED because we want testing to be done with

        code that store to DoesGC::m_value without checking Options::validateDoesGC().
        It doesn't hurt to just let these stores proceed, and performance-wise, it's
        probably cheaper to just do the store unconditionally than to gate it on a load of
        Options::validateDoesGC() first.

        Also made it explicit that the check on validateDFGDoesGC is a constexpr check.

        Reduce DFGDoesGCCheck to only storing a uint32_t.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212734

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Caio Lima.

        This patch changes the encoding of DoesGCCheck so that it will fit better in a
        uint32_t.  This has the following benefits:
        1. speed improvement for debug builds because it now takes less instructions
           (especially in JITted code) to store to DoesGCCheck::m_value.
        2. enables this check for 32-bit platforms as well.

        Fun fact: we currently have 373 DFG::NodeTypes.  Hence, 9 bits for nodeOp.

        The new encoding provides 21 bis for the nodeIndex.  This gives us up to 2097152
        node indexes.  In my experience, I've never seen more than 3 decimal digits for
        the nodeIndex so far.  If we ever find that we need more than 21 bits of nodeIndex,
        we have 2 options to deal with it:

        1. We can just ignore the high bits.  After all, it is the nodeOp that is the
           most interesting piece of data we need to debug doesGC issues.

        2. We can make DoesGCCheck use uint64_t for storage.  This encoding automatically
           scales to 64-bit, while still allowing the more efficient form of storing a
           32-bit immediate to be used for the common cases.

        This patch also makes ENABLE_DFG_DOES_GC_VALIDATION dependent on ENABLE(DFG_JIT).
        DoesGC is only relevant for the DFG and FTL JITs.

        SpeculativeJIT::compileDateGet()'s slow path does not need an exception check.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212645

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        SpeculativeJIT::compileDateGet() implements a bunch of Date intrinsics which call
        into a C++ operation function do their work.  However, the call to these operation
        functions were done using a slow path generator configured to automatically
        emit exception checks after the call.  These exception checks are unneeded because
        those functions will not throw any exceptions.

        This issue was found with JSC stress test runs on a debug build.  The doesGC
        verifier was failing on the exceptionFuzz/date-format-xparb.js test.  The reason
        is because doesGC does not expect any these Date intrinsics to throw any exceptions,
        but SpeculativeJIT was emitting the unneeded exception checks there.  These
        exception check sites get turned into throw sites by the exceptionFuzzer, and
        they allocate an Error object there.  This allocation made the doesGC verifier
        not happy.

        This patch fixes this issue by changing SpeculativeJIT::compileDateGet() to
        pass ExceptionCheckRequirement::CheckNotNeeded to the slow path generator.

        The patch also proves that all the operation functions cannot throw any exceptions.
        Previously, the operations passes a VM& to the Date functions.  The purpose for
        doing this is so that the Date functions can work with a few date cache data
        structures stored as VM fields.

        This patch refactors those VM fields into a VM::DateCache struct, and changed all
        those Date functions to take a VM::DateCache& instead of a VM&.  Since the Date
        functions no longer take a VM&, this proves that they cannot throw because they
        would need a VM& to make a ThrowScope in order to throw.

        Update: Yusuke pointed out that the lack of a JSGlobalObject* argument is sufficient
        to guarantee that the Date functions cannot throw.  However, we'll keep this
        DateCache refactoring since it provides additional info that the Date functions
        only operate on the DateCache fields and nothing else in VM.

        Also removed DFG::JITCompile's fastExceptionCheck() which is unused.

        The hoistLoopInvariantValues optimization in B3 does not calculate the cost of hoisting the candidates.
        For example, in the test case provided with the bug, a switch inside a loop can lead to hoisting the body
        of several switch cases which would never be executed. Other than leading to worse runtime, this also
        increases the pressure in the register allocate, leading to worse compile times (~10x worse in this case).
        I have added a FIXME to consider adding cost calculation and re-enabling this pass, but given that we
        already have LICM in DFG, it should be ok to disable it for now.

            ASSERTION FAILED: expectDoesGC()

        The error message now comes with the node index, NodeType, codeBlock which this
        failure was found in, and the JS call stack that led to the failure.

        Changes made:

        1. Introduced a DoesGCCheck value that is used to encode some of the above data.

           Previously, we only recorded whether doesGC() returns true or false for the
           Node.  Now, we record the nodeIndex and nodeOp as well.

           Note that we also set DoesGC expectations for OSR exits.  So, DoesGCCheck
           includes Special cases for those.

        2. Added store64(TrustedImm64 imm, const void* address) emitters for X86_64 and ARM64.
           Also added a test for this new emitter in testmasm.

        Without this, strange build failures can happen with unified builds.

        For example, the Windows build started failing due a linkage error in this file
        when the patch from https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212680 landed.
        212680 introduced a new .cpp file, and that probably bumped DFGSSAConversionPhase.cpp
        into another unified unit, thereby depriving it from seeing the OperandsInlines.h
        #include'd by another .cpp.

        Enhance DoesGC verification to print more useful info when verification fails.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212680

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        When DoesGC verification fails, the first step of debugging it would be to find
        out what and which DFG node resulted in the failed verification.  In pre-existing
        code, all we get is an assertion failure.

        This patch makes it so that the verifier will dump useful info.  Here's an example:

            ASSERTION FAILED: expectDoesGC()

        The error message now comes with the node index, NodeType, codeBlock which this
        failure was found in, and the JS call stack that led to the failure.

        Changes made:

        1. Introduced a DoesGCCheck value that is used to encode some of the above data.

           Previously, we only recorded whether doesGC() returns true or false for the
           Node.  Now, we record the nodeIndex and nodeOp as well.

           Note that we also set DoesGC expectations for OSR exits.  So, DoesGCCheck
           includes Special cases for those.

        2. Added store64(TrustedImm64 imm, const void* address) emitters for X86_64 and ARM64.
           Also added a test for this new emitter in testmasm.

        VMInspector APIs should be taking a VM* instead of a JSGlobalObject*.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212676

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Robin Morisset.

        This because:
        1. None of the functions currently taking a JSGlobalObject* actually need the
           globalObject.  All of them need the VM.
        2. The role of the VMInspector is to enable inspection of the VM.  By requiring
           that it be passed a JSGlobalObject*, we were actually preventing the VMInspector
           from being used in code that have a VM to inspect but don't have a JSGlobalObject
           to use.

        The reason I'm choosing to pass VM* instead of VM& is because it makes these
        functions trivial to call using lldb interactively.  The VMInspector functions
        are also intentionally designed so that they can be used for this purpose.
        On occasion, I may have to cast literal numbers (addresses) to VM*.  Technically,
        I could cast a number to VM* and dereference it to get a VM& too.  However, at
        present, lldb is often buggy and not always reliable with casts.  I would like to
        lessen the chance that lldb fails on me when I'm deep in the middle of a debugging
        session, and have a need to call one of these functions.

        Correct misunderstandings on how ThreadSpecific work
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212616

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        There were two misunderstandings I had when writing code using ThreadSpecific
        when doing LLInt bytecode buffer caching in Wasm.
        
        1. For ThreadSpecific<Vector>, I was calling Vector's constructor twice
        unnecessarily, and incorrectly, since we ended up constructing over an
        already constructed Vector for the second call. When doing operator* or
        operator-> on a ThreadSpecific<T>, T() is called if it has not been
        initialized yet. So there is no need to do manually call the constructor
        the second time.
        
        2. There is no need to try to destroy entries for ThreadSpecific manually
        since we already run destructors when the thread goes away.
        
        This patch removes code for (1) and (2) both from the Wasm bytecode
        buffer and from AssemblerData.

        The current implementation mistakenly sets the address type to that of the value

        Including WebCore code, there are a lot of code which assume JSValue::toThis should not throw an exception.

        AssemblyHelpers::callExceptionFuzz() is passing a wrong argument to operationExceptionFuzz().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212561

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        There's 2 possible solution to this issue:
        1. Thread the globalObject from all the way up the clients calling into
           callExceptionFuzz(), or
        2. Introduce a operationExceptionFuzzWithCallFrame() wrapper take receives a VM*
           and CallFrame*, and use these to get the lexicalGlobalObject.

        This patch applies solution 2.

        Solution 1 is too unwieldy because it will cause the threading of the globalObject
        argument to fan out to many clients, and almost all of those clients currently
        do not need the globalObject.  Hence, implementing this solution may incur some
        performance penalty in normal code, for the sole benefit of this one fuzzing tool.

        Secondly, the exception fuzzer doesn't really care which globalObject is used.
        It only cares that an exception is thrown, and we need a globalObject in order to
        throw that exception.  Hence, there is no benefit to threading the globalObject
        down from all the clients.

        We need to properly model the aliasing dependencies of an inlined delete 
        operation. 
        
        We had a bug in the B3 IR we generated from code like this for a delete
        followed by a property addition:
        ```
        const o = { y: 0 };
        delete o.y;
        o.z = 0;
        ```
        
        generated:
        
        ```
        note: bb#5 dominates bb#10, bb#10 dominates bb#15
        
        bb#5
        Void b@125 = Store($-562949953421312(b@282), b@112, offset = 16, ControlDependent|Writes:129, D@30)
        bb#10
        Void b@171 = Store($0(b@2), b@112, offset = 16, ControlDependent|Writes:129, D@37)
        bb#15
        Void b@217 = Store($-562949953421312(b@282), b@112, offset = 16, ControlDependent|Writes:130, D@44)
        ```
        
        Notice that "y" and "z" ended up at the same property offset.
        
        In the above program, B3 proves the pointer we're storing to is the same value
        in all three stores (b@112). However, because of how it does store forwarding,
        it determined it could eliminate b@217 because b@125 already stored the same
        value to the same pointer. It didn't know that b@171 was a write because its
        heap range is different than @217. Generally, when using two heap ranges, it's
        telling B3 that two pointers don't alias.
        ```
        @A, Heap_H
        @B, Heap_H
        ```
        In the above program, 
        - If @B reads H and @A writes H, then @B is dependent on @A.
        - If @B writes H, then @B is dependent on @A if @A reads or writes H.
        
        So for delete, we need to model the deletion of a property as actually
        writing to all named properties that may exist at that slot given a
        series of structure transitions. We model this by saying the PutStructure
        for an inlined delete, or MultiDeleteByOffset, writes to all named properties
        (which is a superset of all named properties that may exist at that slot
        through a series of transitions).

        for-of should check the iterable is a JSArray for FastArray in DFG iterator_open
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212383

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch fixes an issue where we didn't check that the iterable operand to
        iterator_open was a JSArray when lowering the FastArray only variant of the bytecode to the DFG.
        This meant we would OSR exit at the iterator_next's lowering then assertion failure in the
        checkpoint OSR exit helper. To make this work, this patch extends (and renames from CheckSubClass)
        CheckJSCast to use the same JSType information that we use for the jsCast function. In order to
        get the JSType range from a ClassInfo* the macro that autogenerates MethodTable now also fills
        a Optional<JSTypeRange> into the ClassInfo as well.

        Lastly, speculationFromClassInfo was misused by AI. This patch
        renames it to speculationFromClassInfoInheritance to better
        reflect how AI was using it. The only other user of
        speculationFromClassInfo was speculationFromStructure. Any case
        where speculationFromClassInfoInteritance would differ from what a
        Structure would tell you has been hoisted to
        speculationFromStructure.

        hasOwnProperty inside structure property for-in loop should use an opcode like has_structure_property but for hasOwnProperty
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212248

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch applies the same principles from r262083 but to hasOwnProperty.
        
        In this patch, we have a fast path for this syntactic pattern when
        iterating structure properties:
        
        for (let <p> in <o>)
            if (<o>.hasOwnProperty(<p>))
        
        We look for both <p> and <o> as resolve nodes, and we look for them being the
        same values both in the header and inside the body.
        
        Using a simple static analysis, when we detect this pattern, we compare the
        result of `<o>.hasOwnProperty` to the original hasOwnProperty function. If
        it's the same, we execute the fast path new bytecode has_own_structure_property,
        which on the fast path is two loads, a compare and branch, and a materialization of
        the boolean constant true.
        
        On the slow path, has_own_structure_property just executes the runtime code 
        for hasOwnProperty.
        
        In my testing, this seems like it might be 3-5% faster on Speedometer 2's
        react subtests. I was getting some noise when running the tests locally,
        so I can't say for certain it's a definite speedup. But the data implies
        it has a good chance at being a speedup.

        r261600 added IsConstructor rule to DFG AI. That rule is saying that if the object is not JSFunction and not ProxyObject,
        then it must not be a constructor. But this is wrong since any objects can implement getConstructData and DOM constructors
        are actually implementing it while it is not JSFunction and it is not ProxyObject. This patch removes that rule.

        Web Inspector: replace `featureGuard` and `availability` with a combined `condition` that accepts any macro

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        Previously, the generated InspectorBackendCommands.js would include code for things that the
        backend doesn't actually support. By using actual macros and preprocessing that file, we can
        ensure that the frontend doesn't incorrectly think that something is supported by the page
        being inspected:
         - the `Canvas` commands and events related to shader programs/pipelines should only exist
           when the corresponding context type exists, namely `ENABLE(WEBGL)` and `ENABLE(WEBGPU)`.
         - iOS doesn't support showing rulers, so create a variant of `DOM.setInspectModeEnabled`
           that only exists for `PLATFORM(IOS_FAMILY)` that doesn't have the `showRulers` optional
           parameter, as well as removing `Page.setShowRulers` entirely.
         - setting the forced appearance should only be possible if dark mode is supported.
         - web archives only exist if CF is used.

        Add some new emitters to the X86_64 and ARM64 MacroAssemblers.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212385

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        This patch adds these MacroAssembler emitters: 
            clearBit64
            clearBits64WithMask
            countTrailingZeros64WithoutNullCheck

        clearBit64 clears a bit.

        clearBits64WithMask does the equivalent of and64 with the 1's complement of the
        provided mask.

        countTrailingZeros64WithoutNullCheck does the same thing as countTrailingZeros64,
        except that it assumes that the word in the register it is processing will never
        be null, and therefore skips the null check.  This is useful in code generation
        that already does a null check ahead of time.  So, there's no need to do a
        redundant null check.

        Also added testmasm tests for these emitters.

        IteratorClose should suppress GetMethod errors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212378

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch implements recent spec change [1] that prevents "return" method lookup error
        from overriding outer exception, aligning JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        It is accomplished by moving pushTry() before emitGetById() in BytecodeGenerator.cpp
        (covered by test262 suite) and removal of RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION in IteratorOperations.cpp
        (added a stress test).

        Before this patch, JSC partly implemented the spec change [1] by suppressing TypeError
        if "return" method of iterator was not callable.

        BytecodeGenerator::emitDelegateYield() is intentionally left unchanged.
        Also, this patch utilizes emitIteratorGenericClose() to avoid code duplication.
        for/of microbenchmarks are neutral.

        Switch from the "legacy" Xcode build system to the "new" build system
        (also known as "XCBuild"). Switching to the new system speeds up
        builds by a small percentage, better validates projects for
        build-related issues (such as dependency cycles), lets WebKit benefit
        from future improvements in XCBuild such as those coming from the
        underlying llbuild open source project, and prepares us for any other
        tools built for this new ecosystem.

        Specific changes:

        - Remove Xcode project and workspace settings that selected the Build
          system, allowing the default to take hold (which is currently the
          New build system).
        - Updated webkitdirs.pm with a terser check for Xcode version.
        - Update build-webkit and Makefile.shared to be explicit when using
          the old build system (no longer treat it as a default or fall-back
          configuration).
        - Update various xcconfig files similarly to treat the default as
          using the new build system.
        - Update various post-processing build steps to check for Xcode 11.4
          and to no longer treat the default as using the old build system.

        in_by_val inside structure property for-in loop should use an opcode like has_structure_property but for "in"
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212239

        Reviewed by Tadeu Zagallo.

        There is code inside Speedometer 2 that is like:
        
        ```
        for (let p in o) {
            if (p in o2)
                ...
        }
        ```
        
        Where o and o2 frequently share the same structure. Elm does this when it's
        diffing two objects. We already optimize o2[p] (get_by_val) in the above loop
        for structure properties. This patch adds that same optimization for in_by_val.
        Because we already emit a "structure" loop for for-in, where we iterate structure
        properties, the fast path for the above, where o and o2 have the same
        structure is simply a structure check followed by return true.
        
        This patch introduces the new opcode: op_in_structure_property. Its fast path is identical
        to op_has_structure_property. Its slow path, however, behaves like "in", which
        uses the HasProperty internal method, unlike op_has_structure_property,
        which uses the GetOwnProperty internal method. This behavior difference is
        observable using Proxy.
        
        This a 5% perf improvement in the Elm subtest in Speedometer 2.

        Add an option that exposes functions on the global object to turn on and off the sampling profiler and the super sampler

        When profiling things like Speedometer inside the browser, it's important to
        to only enable the super sampler and the sampling profiler around the code
        that you want profiled. Otherwise, you will be profiling things that aren't
        relevant to the benchmark score. This patch adds a new option, exposeProfilersOnGlobalObject,
        which when true, will expose JS functions on the global object that allow
        enabling/disabling the super sampler and the sampling profiler. This way,
        we can change the Speedometer source code locally such that these profilers
        are only sampling code accounted for in the benchmark score.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        In 32bit architecture, we are creating one-length JSBigInt for INT32_MIN <= x <= INT32_MAX, and two-length JSBigInt otherwise.
        This is wrong since one-length JSBigInt should cover from -UINT32_MAX <= x <= UINT32_MAX.

        This patch fixes the bug and cleans up createFrom(VM&, int64_t). And it also adds JSBigInt::createFrom(VM&, uint64_t) in preparation for [1]
        Currently, this path is not used while it was used previously because BigIntConstructor starts using JSBigInt::createFrom(VM&, double). But this
        will be used in [1], and simply the existing implementation is wrong.

        Given that memory grows O(N^2) compiling Wasm code through the OMG path,

        parameters.

        As part of this change, we still go through the OMG loop entry OSR code
        generation path for functions that are at or above the threshold, but we
        compile such functions with BBQ compilation optimization levels.
        Also for Wasm functions at or above  the threashold, we don't tier up to an
        OMG compiled normal entry function.  Instead we stay with the BBQ compiled version.

        Do more speculation that a GetByVal/PutByVal will have an int32 index based on data from ArrayProfile
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211877

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Before this patch, when a GetByVal or PutByVal had a non int32 prediction for
        their incoming index, they'd fall completely off the fast path. However, there
        are programs where an int32 is boxed inside a double, but our notion of
        predicted types don't fully capture this fact. For example, if we have a double Add
        to produce an array index, that double Add will predict a full double result,
        not a SpecAnyIntAsDouble. However, for GetByVal and PutByVal, there is information
        from ArrayProfile we can use to determine if the incoming value is expected to
        be in int32 range. The heuristic this patch introduces is:
        
        isFullNumberSpeculation(indexSpeculation)
        && node->arrayMode().isSpecific()
        && node->arrayMode().isInBounds()
        && !m_graph.hasExitSite(node->origin.semantic, Overflow) // DoubleAsInt32 will exit with Overflow on failure
        
        If these conditions are met, we'll now emit a DoubleAsInt32 conversion node
        for the index. This puts along the fast path for GetByVal and PutByVal on
        array accesses where the incoming index is an int32 boxed in a double.
        
        To make the above isFullNumberSpeculation check more robust, this patch also
        makes it so non index double accesses result in marking the array profile as
        out of bounds. So this means indices greater than max safe index, and also,
        fractional doubles.

        Loc13 in this IR is the location of the next function. Since it's
        nullptr, we will pass the initial fast-path value of 0 and make a
        garbage call. This is because Call does not know how to handle
        empty values. Subsequently, we will fail a structure check for the
        Call's result and OSR exit to the getDone checkpoint. The fix for
        this is to simply put a CheckNotEmpty at the top of the generic
        case. 99.9% of the time this check will be eliminated so it
        doesn't really cost anything.

        [JSC] Make OutOfMemory error as instance of RangeError
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211952

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        The spec sometimes requires "check parameters and throw RangeError" before allocating an object.
        But we are just allocating an object and throwing an out-of-memory error since wrong parameter will
        cause out-of-memory. If out-of-memory error is RangeError, then we can keep our current behavior while
        we can make us spec compliant. And note that out-of-memory error is RangeError in SpiderMonkey and V8.

        This patch makes out-of-memory error as RangeError instead of Error. We also fix @throwOutOfMemoryError
        in builtin code: the previous thrown errors are not marked as out-of-memory error.

        GetByVal and PutByVal runtime operations shouldn't fall off a performance cliff when the property is an integer boxed as a double
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211935

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki and Mark Lam.

        There were parts in the runtime for get_by_val that weren't properly handling
        ints boxed as doubles along the fast path. This could lead to terrible
        performance as we could go from double -> string -> int while converting the
        subscript into a property to access.
        
        This patch fixes that, and removes the duplicate code we had throughout the
        codebase that does this conversion. I'm adding a new functions tryGetAsUint32Index
        and tryGetAsInt32 which will handle the double to int conversion.

        GetArrayLength should be "blessed" during Fixup phase in the DFG
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211540

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        If we got an ArrayMode during bytecode parsing for-of that expects
        to be configured during Fixup, then right now we will crash on
        GetArrayLength. This fixes GetArrayLength to properly call
        blessArrayOperation and fixes clobberize to know that
        GetArrayLength could have a ForceExit ArrayMode briefly before
        being cleaned up.

        When blessing GetArrayLength we can now produce CheckArrays that
        have an AnyTypedArray ArrayMode::Type. So this patch expands
        CheckArray to properly handle that. To help with this we expand
        branchIfType to have a starting JSType and an optional ending
        JSType. Additionally, to prevent extra checks AI has been taught
        to fold more ArrayModes so we should almost always avoid new
        runtime checks.

        Lastly, make sure that Undecided Arrays don't fall back to generic
        because GetArrayLength can't be converted to...
        GetArrayLenth. Also, GetArrayLength would previously pass it's own
        speculation for the speculation of the index, which logically
        doesn't make sense. So this patch adds a new constant, which is
        SpecInt32Only, that can be passed if a DFG node doesn't have an
        index.

        This change replaces @isConstructor link-time-constant with bytecode intrinsic and utilizes it

        Before this patch, we checked if "prototype" of superclass is an object, which is incorrect for
        generators and bound non-constructor functions with own "prototype".

        OpIsConstructor's fast path can't be easily compiled, and it's not a hot code anyway, so instead
        we reduce code bloat by just calling slow ops from DFG and FTL (if we bail out, we slow down all
        @isConstructor call sites). This advances microbenchmarks/is-constructor.js by ~35%.

        Exception check for OOM is a bit too late in JSBigInt::exponentiate.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We were doing multiplyImpl(...).payload.asHeapBigInt(), but multiplyImpl can return a null payload if it causes an exception.
        So we must first check whether an exception was raised, and only if not can we do asHeapBigInt.

        We were treating a check, even if it wasn't on the sink candidate,

        1. Initialize VMTraps' signals early now that we'll be freezing signals at the end
           of the first VM initialization.

        2. Move the !initializeThreadingHasBeenCalled RELEASE_ASSERT in initializeThreading()
           to the bottom of the function.  This way, we'll also catch bugs which may cause
           us to jump into the middle of the function.

           Added a compilerFence there to ensure that the RELEASE_ASSERT is only executed
           after all initialization is done.  This guarantees that it will only be executed
           at the end.

        3. Call WTF::Config::permanentlyFreeze() from JSC::Config::permanentlyFreeze()
           for obvious reasons: freezing one should freeze the other.

        Array.prototype.concat fast path checks should not be observable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211643

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        This change utilizes @tryGetByIdWithWellKnownSymbol intrinsic to make
        off the spec Symbol.isConcatSpreadable lookups unobservable to userland code,
        aligning JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        Since @tryGetById uses PropertySlot::getPureResult(), which returns `null`
        for Proxy [[Get]] traps and JS getters (covered by stress/try-get-by-id.js),
        we can safely compare its result `undefined`. Also, this allows us to remove
        @isProxyObject check as Proxy argument is never a fast path anyway.

        Inlining can cause some level of recursion of the DFG bytecode parser.  We should
        do a stack check at each inlining check before recursing.  If a stack overflow
        appears to be imminent, then just refuse to inline, and therefore, don't recurse
        deeper into the parser.

        This issue is more noticeable on ASan debug builds where stack frames can be
        humongous.

        Removed the SUPPRESS_ASAN on cloberrize() and the associated comment from r260692.

        DFG ByVal nodes with ArrayModes should clobberTop until Fixup phase runs.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211531

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        When parsing bytecode we may pick a relatively constrained
        ArrayMode based on our profiling. Some of these modes may not
        clobber exit state.  However, Fixup sometimes wants to widen this
        to a more generic mode based on other data. This causes us to
        think it was valid to exit immediately after the
        GetByVal/HasIndexedProperty, which would be wrong with the wider
        ArrayMode. We may also incorrectly insert invalidition points
        if clobberize gives us the wrong data.

        To fix this clobberize should say All ByVal nodes clobberTop()
        until after fixup. Additionally, this patch adds an assertion that
        nodes don't go from not clobbering exit state to clobbering exit
        state during fixup.

        [ECMA-402] Implement Intl.Locale
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209772

        Reviewed by Darin Adler and Saam Barati.

        This patch implements the recent ECMA-402 feature Intl.Locale.

        This is effectively a wrapper class for all the pieces of uloc.h that ECMA-402 cares about.
        (If we used the C++ API, there's a LocaleBuilder that would make this much easier, but in sticking to the C API,
        it's basically an object that has an ICU localeID as data and uloc_* functions as methods / getters.
        Furthermore, there's no way to modify said data, so every method / getter can be lazy and cache its result.)

        Usage example:
          >>> locale = new Intl.Locale('ja', { region: 'JP', calendar: 'japanese', numeric: false })
          "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-kn-false"
          >>> locale.baseName
          "ja-JP"

        Intl.Locale can be used anywhere that Intl APIs accept locale strings as input parameters,
        and is moreover hoped to be the class by which future Web APIs will handle the current locale.

        This feature is runtime-guarded by the `useIntlLocale` option.

        This patch implements BigInt.asIntN[1] and BigInt.asUintN[2] features.
        As the same to the other BigInt runtime C++ code, we port V8 code to JSC to implement both.

        BigInt.asIntN is `static_cast<intN_t>(BigInt value)` and BigInt.asUintN is `static_cast<uintN_t>(BigInt value)`.
        They are getting slice of N bits from two's complement representation of the given BigInt. The difference between
        asIntN and asUintN is asIntN renders MSB as a sign.

        This patch is once rolled out due to ARM64_32 build failure, which is caused by the existing bug[3]. Relanding it

        JSBigInt::maxLengthBits and JSBigInt::maxLength definitions are wrong.

        1. We are defining maxLength and maxLengthBits as an unrelated value to each other. This is wrong.
           maxLength should be defined as maxLengthBits / (sizeof(Digit) * bitsPerByte).
        2. We use `sizeof(void*)` and assume that `sizeof(Digit) == sizeof(void*)`. This is wrong in ARM64_32 environment
           where Digit size is sizeof(uint64_t) while the pointer size is sizeof(uint32_t). This causes compile errors in ARM64_32
           when the code is using these values with static_assert.

        Object.prototype.toString is not spec-perfect
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199138

        Reviewed by Darin Adler and Keith Miller.

        Before ES6, Object.prototype.toString relied only on internal [[Class]] slot. Starting with ES6,
        Object.prototype.toString checks for a handful of internal slots, mimicing [[Class]], to ensure
        backwards compatibility for pre-ES6 instances. Newly-added built-ins provide @@toStringTag for
        the method to use.

        Before this change, Object.prototype.toString in JSC relied on className() a.k.a [[Class]] for
        all instances. For (almost all) new built-ins, it was overriden by toStringName() returning
        "Object", while @@toStringTag was set to correct value. This is quite an error-prone approach
        and observable spec discrepancy if @@toStringTag is deleted or set to a non-string.

        This change eliminates the above-mentioned discrepancy and fixes Object.prototype.toString
        to return "[object Function]" for callable Proxy objects, aligning JSC with the spec [1], V8,
        and SpiderMonkey.

        For Object.prototype.toString to work through DebuggerScope and JSProxy, we perform all checks
        in JSObject::toStringName(). Given that isArray() may throw a TypeError [2], we invoke
        toStringName() before @@toStringTag lookup to accomodate revoked Proxy case.

        Also, this patch defines @@toStringTag for WebAssembly namespace object (to match Chrome),
        JSC shell, and ConsoleObject.

        [JSC] DFG NotCellUse is used without considering about BigInt32
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211395

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        When we see CompareXXX(BigInt32, Double), we are emitting CompareXXX(DoubleRep(BigInt:NotCellUse), Double). But this has two problems.

        1. We should emit CompareXXX(UntypedUse, UntypedUse) in this case.
        2. DoubleRep(NotCellUse) does not support converting BigInt32 to double. Since DoubleRep's semantics is for ToNumber, it should not
           accept BigInt32 since it should throw an error. However, DoubleRep currently assumes that NotCellUse value can be converted to double
           without any errors.

        To keep DoubleRep's semantics ToNumber, we replace NotCellUse with NotCellNorBigIntUse, which rejects BigInt32. This patch also uses NotCellNorBigIntUse
        for ValueToInt32 because of the same reason.

        For CompareXXX and CompareEq nodes, we can optimize it if we introduce new DoubleRepAcceptingBigInt32 DFG node which can convert BigInt32 to Double, since
        CompareXXX and CompareEq are not requiring toNumber semantics. This should be done in a separate bug https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211407.

        Have a thread local cache for the Wasm LLInt bytecode buffer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211317

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo and Mark Lam.

        One of the main things slowing down Wasm compile times is the banging
        on bmalloc's global heap lock. This patch makes it so for the bytecode
        instruction buffer, we keep a thread local cache with latest capacity
        the thread needed to compile. This makes it so that in the average case,
        we only do one malloc at the end of a compile to memcpy the final result.
        
        We clear these thread local caches when the WasmWorklist's automatic threads
        underlying machine thread is destroyed.

        [WebIDL] Interface prototype objects should define @@toStringTag
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211020

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        WebIDL spec was recently updated [1] to define @@toStringTag on interface prototype objects.
        This change aligns WebIDL with ECMA-262 built-ins and Blink's behavior. Gecko have also
        expressed implementation commitment.

        This patch implements the spec change, making `X.prototype.toString()` return "[object X]"
        instead of "[object XPrototype]", where X is WebIDL interface. This behavior is proven to
        be web compatible (shipping in Chrome since Q2 2016) and matches class strings of iterator
        prototype objects [2] introduced in r253855.

        We define @@toStringTag for all WebAssembly interfaces but Error subclasses since they
        are not defined using WebIDL [3].

        This change also introduces JSC_TO_STRING_TAG_WITHOUT_TRANSITION() macro that sets up
        @@toStringTag using ClassInfo to avoid extra strings creation, ensuring `className` equality
        between prototype and instance classes (fixing a few discrepancies), as well as correct
        descriptors. It also ensures using faster jsNontrivialString() and relieves from putting
        more code into CodeGeneratorJS.pm.

        We can't cast toLength result to unsigned
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211205
        <rdar://problem/62625562>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        toLength, according to the spec, returns a 53-bit integer. In our
        implementation, we return a double. However, there were many callsites
        that did something like:
        ```
        unsigned length = toLength(obj);
        ```
        
        This is bad for a few reasons:
        - Casting to unsigned from double is undefined behavior when the integer
        is greater than UINT_MAX. In practice, this means that we'd have different
        engine behavior depending on what architecture we'd be running on. For
        example, if the length were UINT_MAX + 1, on x86, we'd treat the
        length as zero. On arm64, we'd treat it as UINT_MAX. Both are wrong.
        - We weren't spec compliant. We were just ignoring that these numbers could
        be 53-bit integers.
        
        This patch addresses each bad use of the undefined behavior, and by doing so,
        makes us more spec compliant.

        Boolean options for Intl constructors can have default values of true, false, or undefined.
        To handle the undefined case, intlBooleanOption currently has a `bool& usesFallback` param;
        we should have the return type simply be a TriState instead.

        Ensure Intl classes don't have naming conflicts with unified builds
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211213

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Each Intl class usually has an array named relevantExtensionsKeys and a function named localeData.
        This can result in redefinition errors when unified builds put two of them into the same translation unit. 
        Some are already guarding against this with an internal namespace while others are not.

        As a uniform approach, this patch makes each localeData function a static method and
        puts each relevantExtensionsKeys array (as well as any constants for its indices) into an internal namespace.

        Furthermore, since three different classes are defining an identical UFieldPositionIteratorDeleter,
        this patch consolidates them into one definition in IntlObject.

        Freezing of Gigacage and JSC Configs should be thread safe.

        <rdar://problem/62597619>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        If a client creates multiple VM instances in different threads concurrently, the
        following race can occur:

        Config::permanentlyFreeze() contains the following code:

            if (!g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen)         // Point P1
                g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen = true;   // Point P2

        Let's say there are 2 threads T1 and T2.

        1. T1 creates a VM and gets to point P1, and sees that g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen is not set.
           T1 is about to execute P2 when it gets pre-empted.

        2. T2 creates a VM and gets to point P1, and sees that g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen is not set.
           T2 proceeds to point P2 and sets g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen to true.
           T2 goes on to freeze the Config and makes it not writable.

        3. T1 gets to run again, and proceeds to point P2.
           T1 tries to set g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen to true.
           But because the Config has been frozen against writes, the write to
           g_jscConfig.isPermanentlyFrozen results in a crash.

        This is a classic TOCTOU bug.  The fix is simply to ensure that only one thread
        can enter Config::permanentlyFreeze() at a time.

        [JSC] NumberConstructor should accept BigInt

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch fixes our Number constructor behavior to accept BigInt. According to the spec[1],
        Number constructor should accept BigInt and should generate numbers from that.

        We port V8's BigInt to double conversion code as we did for the other HeapBigInt runtime functions.

        And we introduce CallNumberConstructor DFG node and handle Number constructor call with BigInt correctly
        in DFG and FTL. Previously we were emitting ToNumber DFG node for Number constructor. But this is wrong
        now since ToNumber does not accept BigInt and throws an error, and Number constructor should not use
        ToNumber to implement its implementation. So we should introduce slightly different semantics: CallNumberConstructor
        as we introduced CallStringConstructor in addition to ToString DFG node. And we add appropriate BigInt32 path
        to emit efficient CallNumberConstructor machine code.

        BigInt math runtime shouldn't convert BigInt32 input operands to a heap cell when doing math
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210978

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds support in the runtime for doing alomst all BigInt math
        operations on the inputs either being Int32, HeapBigInt, or a mixing
        of both. Before, if we detected a binary operation on an Int32 and a
        HeapBigInt, this would lead us to convert the Int32 operand into a HeapBigInt.
        
        This is especially bad because we'd repeat this for all math ops. For example,
        if x is a BigInt32, and all rhs are a HeapBigInt, we'd repeatedly convert x
        to a HeapBigInt for each operation:
        ```
        x + y
        x * y
        x - y
        x >> y
        x << y
        etc
        ```
        
        To teach the runtime how to operate both over a BigInt32 and a HeapBigInt, I
        templatized the runtime math operations to work both over BigInt32 and
        HeapBigInt wrapper classes that expose the same interface.

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        While BigInt does not support >>> operator, >>> operator should call ToNumeric (in this case, toBigIntOrInt32) for both before throwing an error.
        We call toBigIntOrInt32 for both operands, and throw an error. And after that, casting int32_t to uint32_t to perform >>> operator. This is correct
        since the only difference between toUint32 and toInt32 is casting int32_t result to uint32_t.

        We were falling through to the generic path for all conditions which
        weren't Equal/NotEqual. The generic path does not do speculation, so
        it was leading to potential miscompiles because we omitted a type check.
        Defining compilePeepHoleBigInt32Branch for other conditions is trivial,

        [JSC] CallData/ConstructData should include CallType/ConstructType
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211059

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        getCallData/getConstructData return a CallType/ConstructType and have a CallData/ConstructData out param,
        and then *both* of these are passed side-by-side to `call`/`construct`, which all seems a bit silly.

        This patch merges CallType/ConstructType into CallData/ConstructData such that getCallData/getConstructData
        no longer need an out param and `call`/`construct` require one less overt parameter.

        In so doing, it also:
        - removes ConstructData entirely as it's an exact duplicate of CallData
        - renames enum value Host to Native in alignment with CallData's union

        InternalFunction::createSubclassStructure should use newTarget's globalObject
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202599

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        If "prototype" of NewTarget is not an object, built-in constructors [1] should acquire
        default [[Prototype]] from realm of NewTarget, utilizing GetFunctionRealm helper [2].
        Before this change, realm of active constructor was used instead. This patch introduces
        GetFunctionRealm and aligns all subclassable constructors with the spec, V8, and SpiderMonkey.

        This change inlines fast paths checks of InternalFunction::createSubclassStructure() and
        simplifies its signature; getFunctionRealm() is invoked in slow paths only.

        While a dynamically created function uses NewTarget's realm for its default [[Prototype]]
        similar to other built-ins, its "prototype" object inherit from ObjectPrototype
        of active constructor's realm [3] (just like their scope), making it retain references
        to 2 different global objects. To accomodate this behavior, this change introduces
        `scopeGlobalObject` in JSFunction.cpp methods.

        Above-mentioned behavior also simplifies creation of JSGenerator and JSAsyncGenerator
        instances since NewTarget's realm is irrelevant to them.

        IntlCollatorConstructor::collatorStructure() and 6 similar methods are removed:
        a) to impose good practice of using newTarget's globalObject;
        b) with this change, each of them have 1 call site max;
        c) other JSC constructors have no methods alike.

        [JSC] ValueAdd, VaueSub, ValueMul, Inc, Dec should say SpecBigInt32 prediction based on ArithProfile
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211038

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch adds profile feedback to ValueAdd, ValueSub, ValueMul, Inc, Dec to say SpecBigInt32 prediction.

        Our HeapBigInt v.s. BigInt32 strategy is simpler than Double v.s. Int32 strategy: we always
        prefer BigInt32 over HeapBigInt. This is because HeapBigInt calculation and conversion require
        much higher cost than BigInt32. This tradeoff is largely different from Double v.s. Int32.
        So keeping HeapBigInt is simply inefficient when we can use BigInt32.

        This means that ArithProfile's feedback is also very simple. If we see HeapBigInt, this means
        overflow happens. In DFG, we propagate this information to ValueAdd, ValueSub, and ValueMul nodes
        and record it in DFGNodeFlags. And based on this information, we change the prediction and
        speculation in prediction propagation and fixup phase.

        We change exit reason from Overflow to BigInt32Overflow since Overflow is solely used for Int32 case,
        and we have Int52Overflow for Int52 case. We should have BigInt32Overflow for BigInt32 to precisely
        record and tell about what happens in DFG as a feedback for the next compilation.

        We add BigInt32 speculation for ValueSub. Previously, we missed that in fixup phase and we always
        speculate ValueSub with AnyBigIntUse or HeapBigIntUse. Now it can use BigInt32Use.

        We also fix Inc / Dec's fixup phase to use BigInt path. Previously, it was always using UntypedUse since
        `node->child1()->shouldSpeculateUntypedForArithmetic()` returns true for BigInt. We fix the ordering of
        speculation attempts as it is done in the other places in fixup phase.

        This patch offers 7.9% performance improvement in sunspider-sha1-big-int.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The mappings for locale canonicalization in latest CLDR are sufficiently complex
        that it really no longer makes sense not to have ICU do this work for us.

        This means the UTS 35 canonicalization desired by ECMA-402 will not be fully achievable until ICU ~67,
        but it's better than reaching right into CLDR and pretending that we *are* ICU.
        (On this point, we thus align with V8 and diverge from SM.)

        Of course, we can still add our own pre-validations / post-canonicalizations if desired.

        Return BigInt32 whenever we can
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210922

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch makes it so our runtime functions for big int math on heap
        big ints converts the result to a big int 32 when possible.
        
        The inspiration for this patch came from converting SunSpider's sha1 benchmark to
        using big ints. I found that that original implementation of big int 32
        was a ~35% slowdown here. This patch speeds it up by 86% from ToT, and
        36% faster than before big int 32 was introduced.
        
        To make this sound in the DFG/FTL, we are currently reporting that all
        HeapBigInt math ops return SpecBigInt, instead of SpecHeapBigInt.
        However, we want to do better in a follow up. We need some kind of profiling
        system where we determine if we should speculate if the result is big int
        32, a heap big int, or both:

        Fix OSR exiting/iterator object checks in for-of bytecodes

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch fixes some bugs in the DFGBytecodeParser where we would
        set the exit origin for the SetLocal following the iterator_open/next
        first call to the next bytecode. This meant that if out-of-line
        Symbol.iterator or next functions returned an unexpected non-cell
        we would OSR past the rest of the next bytecode rather than to the
        first checkpoint.

        This patch also makes sure we properly throw for non-objects returned
        from either of the above functions in all tiers (and adds tests).

        Finally, this patch makes a small optimization where we just ArithBitOr the
        iterator's closed state (index == -1) and index is out of bounds. We can't
        do a CompareBelow check because the index is effectively an int33_t.

        constructObjectFromPropertyDescriptor() is incorrect with partial descriptors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184629

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        Before this change, constructObjectFromPropertyDescriptor() serialized a value-only descriptor
        with nullish m_seenAttributes to {value, writable: false, enumerable: false, configurable: false}
        instead of just {value}. This was observable when ordinarySetSlow() was called on a Proxy
        `receiver` with "defineProperty" trap.

        This patch makes constructObjectFromPropertyDescriptor() 1:1 with the spec [2], aligning JSC
        with V8 and SpiderMonkey, and also cleans up its call sites from handling exceptions and
        `undefined` value returns.

        Intl classes shouldn't need an m_initialized* field
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210764

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Existing Intl classes each have a field like m_initializedNumberFormat, but this is unnecessary on two levels:
          1. The thing that gets initialized is a unique pointer to an ICU struct, so we can check it directly.
          2. Everywhere we're checking this is redundant since we've already done the same check on the prototype side,
             therefore we can just ASSERT before using said ICU struct.

        While we're at it, clean up other stuff like:
          - Move stuff that doesn't need to be part of the class to the CPP file (e.g. UFieldPositionIteratorDeleter).
          - Merge createCollator into initializeCollator (seems like this is probably the oldest code in this space).

        [ECMA-402] Intl.RelativeTimeFormat missing in WebKit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209770

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch implements the recent ECMA-402 feature Intl.RelativeTimeFormat.

        RelativeTimeFormat has format / formatToParts functions like NumberFormat / DateTimeFormat
        and is used to turn a number and unit into a formatted relative time string, e.g.:

          new Intl.RelativeTimeFormat('en').format(10, 'day')
          > 'in 10 days'

          new Intl.RelativeTimeFormat('en', { numeric: 'auto' }).format(0, 'day')
          > 'today'

        Implementation of RelativeTimeFormat#formatToParts makes direct use of NumberFormat#formatToParts,
        as the relative time string consists of at most one formatted number with optional literal text on either side.

        This feature is runtime-guarded by the `useIntlRelativeTimeFormat` option.

        [JSC] LLInt slow path call should not have third argument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210721

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        LLInt callSlowPath does not work with third argument in Windows, CLoop etc. LLInt slow-path should not take third argument,
        instead, use `bytecode.metadata(...)` to get metadata.

        Support an inlined representation in JSValue of small BigInts ("BigInt32")
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206182

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch attempts to optimize the performance of BigInts, when they are small (32 bit or less).
        It works by inlining them into JSValue on 64-bit platforms, avoiding the allocation of a JSBigInt.
        The bit pattern we use is 0000:XXXX:XXXX:0012
        This representation works because of the following things:
        - It cannot be confused with a Double or Integer thanks to the top bits
        - It cannot be confused with a pointer to a Cell, thanks to bit 1 which is set to true
        - It cannot be confused with a pointer to wasm thanks to bit 0 which is set to false
        - It cannot be confused with true/false because bit 2 is set to false
        - It cannot be confused for null/undefined because bit 4 is set to true

        This entire change is gated by USE(BIGINT32), to make it easier to disable if it turns out to have bugs.
        It should also make it much easier to verify if a given bug comes from it or from something else.

        Note that in this patch we create BigInt32s when parsing small BigInt constants, and most operations (e.g. Add or BitOr) produce a BigInt32 if both of their operands are BigInt32,
        but we don't produce a BigInt32 from for example the substraction/division of two large heap-allocated JSBigInts, even if the result fits in 32-bits.
        As a result, small BigInts can now either be heap-allocated or inlined in the JSValue.

        This patch includes a significant refactor of various slow paths, which are now grouped together in Operations.h
        Because this increased the size of Operations.h significantly, I split the parts of Operations.h which are only used by the GC into Scribble.h, to avoid bloating compile times.

        In the DFG and FTL we now have 3 UseKinds for BigInts: HeapBigIntUse, BigInt32Use and AnyBigIntUse.
        The latter is useful when we know that we are receiving BigInts, but speculation indicates a mix of heap-allocated and small (inlined) big-ints.

        Unfortunately, a naive implementation of this patch significantly regresses the performance of StrictEq (and its variants), as it is no longer true that a cell and a non-cell cannot be equal.
        Before this patch, the code was jumping to a slow path if either:
        - at least one operand is a double
        - or both operands are cells
        Now, it also needs to jump to the slow path if at least one is a cell.
        To recover this performance cost, I significantly rewrote this code, from
          if (left is Cell && right is Cell) {
            if (left == right)
              return true;
            goto slowPath;
          }
          if (! left is Int32) {
            if (left is Number)
              goto slowPath
          }
          if (! right is Int32) {
            if (right is Number)
              goto slowPath
          }
          return left == right
        To the following:
          if (left is Double || right is Double)
            goto slowPath
          if (left == right)
            return true;
          if (left is Cell || right is Cell)
            goto slowPath
          return false;
        I believe this to be faster than just replacing (left is Cell && right is Cell) by an ||, because I found a bit-trick to check (left is Double || right is Double) which should help reduce the pressure on the branch predictor.
        Early JetStream2 tests appear to confirm that this patch is roughly neutral while it was a 0.5% regression before I used this trick, but the numbers are still too noisy, I plan to do more measurements before landing this patch.

        I don't yet have performance numbers for this patch on a BigInt benchmark, I will get such numbers before trying to land it, but I'd like some review in the meantime.

        Redesign how we do for-of iteration for JSArrays
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175454

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo and Saam Barati.

        This patch intrinsics for-of iteration for JSArrays when they are
        being iterated with the built-in Symbol.iterator. We do this by
        adding two new bytecodes op_iterator_open and
        op_iterator_next. These bytecodes are essentially a fused set of
        existing bytecodes with a special case for our intrinsiced JSArray
        case. This patch only adds support for these instructions on
        64-bit.


        The op_iterator_open bytecode is semantically the same as:
        iterator = symbolIterator.@call(iterable);
        next = iterator.next;

        where iterable is the rhs of the for-of and symbolIterator is the
        result of running iterable.symbolIterator;


        The op_iterator_next bytecode is semantically the same as:
        nextResult = next.@call(iterator);
        done = nextResult.done;
        value = done ? (undefined / bottom) : nextResult.value;

        where nextResult is a temporary (the value VirtualRegister in the
        LLInt/Baseline and a tmp in the DFG).

        In order to make sure these bytecodes have the same perfomance as
        the existing bytecode sequence, we need to make sure we have the
        same profiling data and inline caching. Most of the existing
        get_by_id code assumed a particular bytecode member name was the
        same in each flavor get_by_id access. This patch adds template
        specialized functions that vend the correct
        Profile/VirtualRegister for the current bytecode/checkpoint. This
        means we can have meaningful names for our Bytecode structs and
        still use the generic functions.

        In the LLInt most of the logic for calls/get_by_id had to be
        factored into helper macros, so we could have bytecodes that are
        some combination of those.

        The trickiest part of this patch was getting the hand rolled DFG
        IR to work correctly. This is because we don't have a great way to
        express large chucks of DFG graph that doesn't involve manually
        tracking all the DFG's invariants. Such as:

        1) Flushing/Phantoming values at the end of each block.
        2) Rolling forwards and backwards the BytecodeIndex when switching
           blocks.
        3) Remembering to GetLocal each variable at the top of every block.
        4) Ensuring that the JSValue stored to the op_iterator_next.m_value
           local does not cause us to OSR exit at the set local.

        (4) is handled by a new function, bottomValueMatchingSpeculation,
        on DFGGraph that produces a FrozenValue that is roughly the bottom
        for a given speculated type. In a future patch we should make this
        more complete, probably by adding a VM::bottomCellForSetLocal that
        prediction propagation and AI know how treat as a true bottom
        value. See: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210694

        Lastly, this patch changes the DFG NodeType, CheckCell to be
        CheckIsConstant.  CheckIsConstant is equivalent to the == operator
        on JSValue where it just checks the register values are the
        same. In order to keep the same perf that we had for CheckCell,
        CheckIsConstant supports CellUse.

        [JSC] Replace DFG NewPromise with NewInternalFieldObject
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210687

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The feature of DFG::NewPromise can be implemented completely with DFG::NewInternalFieldObject. This reduces code duplication, and furthermore,
        this offers Object Allocation Sinking support for free. This patch replaces DFG::NewPromise with DFG::NewInternalFieldObject and remove DFG::NewPromise
        completely.

        [JSC] We do not need to have exit-check for Map/Set iterator functions

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        If the intrinsic's DFG node does not support general cases, we should check exit-frequency to avoid exit-recompile loop.
        However, Map/Set iterator creation functions (values, keys, entries) always require Map / Set types. And throwing an error
        when this is not met. So, the current DFG nodes for these intrinsic supports all the cases except for the case throwing an
        error, and error will exit anyway. So we do not need to have this exit-frequency guard here.

        This path is already tested by map-iterator-check-before-fail.js / set-iterator-check-before-fail.js.

        [JSC] Implement JSMapIterator/JSSetIterator with JSInternalFieldObjectImpl
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210023

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch reimplement JSMapIterator/JSSetIterator with JSInternalFieldObjectImpl.
        This makes current JSFinalObject-based Map/SetIterator simple and small.
        We generalize NewArrayIterator/PhantomNewArrayIterator to convert them to NewInternalFieldObject/PhantomNewInternalFieldObject
        to support JSMapIterator/JSSetIterator too in DFG / FTL. This makes allocation efficient and object-allocation-sinking aware.

        Disable Store-load pair auto-vectorization for JSC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210574

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        slp-vectorization appears to make our slow path code significantly
        slower. That's because when we materialize our constant bytecode
        structs into C++ we load all the fields at the same time then
        widen them to the struct's member C++ size. Since we have 3
        different possible sizes Clang generates a total mess of
        code. Disabling this does not appear to be a regression on any
        platform I tested and improves the performance of slow path code
        significantly in micro benchmarks.

        The crash is coming from setExceptionPorts which is inlined in WTF::registerThreadForMachExceptionHandling.
        From the error message we know that the problem is an "invalid port right".
        http://web.mit.edu/darwin/src/modules/xnu/osfmk/man/thread_set_exception_ports.html tells us that the "port right" is the third parameter to thread_set_exception_ports, which is exceptionPort in our case.
        exceptionPort is a global variable defined at the top of Signals.cpp:
          static mach_port_t exceptionPort;
        It is set in exactly one place:
          kern_return_t kr = mach_port_allocate(mach_task_self(), MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECEIVE, &exceptionPort);
        in a std::call_once, in startMachExceptionHandlerThread().
        Note that startMachExceptionHandlerThread() is called from the main thread just before the point where we are stuck.. and there is no synchronization to make sure it completed and its effect is visible to the worker thread before it uses exceptionPort.

        So I think the crash is due to this race between allocating exceptionPort and using it, resulting in an invalid exceptionPort being sometimes passed to the kernel.
        So this patch is a simple speculative fix, by running startMachExceptionHandlerThread() in initializeThreading(), before JSLock()::lock() can be run.

        [ESNext] Implement logical assignment operators
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209716

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        Implement the logical assignment operators proposal, which is now Stage 3. It introduces
        three new assignment operators which will only store the result of the rhs in the lhs if the
        lhs meets the given condition:
         - `??=`, for if the lhs is nullish (`null` or `undefined`)
         - `||=`, for if the lhs is falsy
         - `&&=`, for if the lhs is truthy

        This short circuiting can be beneficial as it can avoid a redundant store when used in the
        common JavaScript programming pattern of "defaulting" a parameter.

        ```js
            function foo(x) {
                x = x || 42;
            }
        ```

        If `x` is a truthy value, it would result in the rhs `x` being stored back into the lhs `x`.
        In some situations, this can have negative unintended side-effects, such as for `innerHTML`.

        Logical assignment operators, however, are defined such that they only store if the rhs is
        to actually be needed/used, skipping the redundant store and simply returning lhs otherwise.

        In the case of readonly references, this means that an error is only thrown when the
        assignment occurs, meaning that if the lhs already satisfies the condition it will be used
        and returned with no error.

        [ECMA-402] WebKit Intl does not allow calendar and numberingSystem options
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209784

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

        As an alternative to using `ca` and `nu` extensions in the locale string:
          - the Intl.DateTimeFormat constructor needs to be able to take `calendar` and `numberingSystem` options
            https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-initializedatetimeformat
          - the Intl.NumberFormat needs to be able to take a `numberingSystem` option
            https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-initializenumberformat

        Since we already support `ca` and `nu`, this is a very simple addition.
        The only interesting part is that we must verify that values for these options are 3-8 alphanumeric characters.

        [ECMA-402] Properly implement BigInt.prototype.toLocaleString
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209782

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Our BigInt's toLocaleString has been simply falling back to toString instead of following ECMA-402.
        (https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sup-bigint.prototype.tolocalestring)

        Since {Number, BigInt}.prototype.toLocaleString are internally the same as Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.format,
        this patch simultaneously lets the latter method take a BigInt argument.
        (https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-number-format-functions)

        This patch continues to use the old unum_* API instead of ICU 62's new unumf_* API,
        as the latter would require a large refactor as well as fallback paths.
        (This will, however, be a prerequisite for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209774.)

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Introducing new PtrTags:
            JITProbePtrTag - for the client probe function.
            JITProbeTrampolinePtrTag - for calling the ctiMasmProbeTrampoline.
            JITProbeExecutorPtrTag - for calling the probe executor.
                Currently, this is only the Probe::executeProbe().
            JITProbeStackInitializationFunctionPtrTag - for calling the optional stack
                initialization function that the client probe function may set.

        We'll now use these in the JIT probe mechanism instead of adopting the default
        CFunctionPtrTag.
