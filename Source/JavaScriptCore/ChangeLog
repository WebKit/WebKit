        [JSC] move function wrapping logic to a new Function type
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235382

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        In this initial patch, there is still a lot of JS-builtin machinery,
        including some duplicated functionality. Additionally, JIT support
        has not been incorporated yet.

        Broadly, the idea is that there are custom hooks for calling a
        JSRemoteFunction, which perform the wrapping functionality. This avoids
        the need for allocating closures which contain the wrapping logic.

        [JSC] Convert JSString's non-atomic WTF::String to atomic string while concurrent compilers / heap threads run
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236262

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Inspired from r289177. This patch introduces a new protocol which allows us to replace JSString's underlying non-atomic String
        to atomic String if we once call toIdentifier / toAtomString.

        We had a problem that,

        1. We have a JSString, which has a "test" WTF::String.
        2. We already have "test" atomic string in the table.
        3. Then, when we call JSString::toIdentifier, we know that there is an atomic "test" string, but we cannot replace the current JSString's
           WTF::String because it can be accessed concurrently from concurrent compilers and GC heap helpers.
        4. Thus, JSString keeps non atomic "test" WTF::String.

        But this means that we need to lookup atom string table every time we would like to get an atom string from this JSString.

        So, in this patch, we introduce a new protocol, which allows swapping existing WTF::String with an atom string.

        When we found that JSString has a WTF::String and we already have atom string in the table with the same content (when calling
        toIdentifier / toAtomString), we attempt to replace JSString's WTF::String with the atom string, but *keep the old string in JSC::Heap's
        vector called m_possiblyAccessedStringsFromConcurrentThreads. Then, we can keep these strings alive until next GC ends. This ensures that
        all concurrent compilers / heap helpers can keep accessing to the old strings. And then, in the GC finalize, we clear this vector since
        resumed concurrent compilers and GC heap helpers will not touch these old strings in the next GC cycle. Only case we have a problem is
        that we keep having StringImpl* of the old string after GC safepoint in the concurrent compiler, and the only use of that is
        DFG::Graph::m_copiedStrings. So, I changed the code not to keep old StringImpl* in DFG::Graph::m_copiedStrings. Also, note that we do
        this only when we convert non-atom string to atom string so all UniquedStringImpl* from JSString* (it is atom ones) does not matter since
        they are already atom one: they will not be replaced.

        This does not increase memory usage, rather, improve memory usage since this kept string was anyway held by the wrapper's JSString at least
        until the next GC run. And we clear m_possiblyAccessedStringsFromConcurrentThreads in the next GC run, so we can shrink memory.

        It improves Speedometer2 by 0.2%.

        Lower stack args in Air had a bug where it was emitting a constant
        materialization at the wrong instruction offset for certain types
        of spill instructions. This happens when we have a stack slot that
        is 8 bytes wide, but we're emitting a zero def Move32. We need to
        zero the upper 4 bytes. However, there is also code inside lower
        stack args that uses the temp register when encountering offsets
        that are too large to encode in a single instruction. However,
        this offset materialization code for the second Move32 to zero
        the upper bytes was happening before the actual store. For example,
        we'd end up with:
        movz x16, #k

        Object literal doesn't properly resolve name clash between an accessor and a constant property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220574

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        The spec [1] calls [[DefineOwnProperty]] for every property node, whether it's a
        getter, a setter, or a value. JSC attempts to reduce emitted bytecodes by setting
        up a getter and a setter at once.

        However, there is a slower path that exactly matches the spec, which was called only
        if a spread syntax or a computed property was encountered. With this patch, the slower
        path is also taken in case of a constant property (including a shorthand) with the
        same name as an accessor.

        That causes an incomplete accessor descriptor to correctly overwrite the existing
        data one, which aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        This bug doesn't exist for static class fields and accessors because initialization
        of class fields is deferred [2] and they always overwrite eponymous static methods /
        accessors, no matter the order in source code. No reproduction for private elements either.

        Attempting to [[Set]] JSArray's read-only "length" should throw even with current [[Value]]
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221177

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        As per OrdinarySet algorithm [1]. To achieve that, while ensuring no error is thrown
        if read-only "length" isn't actually changed via [[DefineOwnProperty]] [2], this patch
        moves `newLength == oldLength` check to JSArray::defineOwnProperty().

        That is guaranteed to be correct because:
          a) it's the only caller of setLengthWithArrayStorage() that performs [[DefineOwnProperty]],
             while others implement [[Set]];
          b) there can't possibly be array indices that JSArray::defineOwnProperty() has to remove,
             and even the spec a shortcut here [3].

        All code paths in pop() / shift() / push() / unshift() are covered by the newly added test,
        as well as JSArray's [[DefineOwnProperty]], while slice() / splice() / etc were vetted to
        [[Set]] "length" according to the spec.

        Aligns JSC with SpiderMonkey and partly with V8, which is correct for Object.freeze()
        but not for `Object.defineProperty(array, "length", { writable: false })`.

        Speed-up JSON.stringify() by avoiding "toJSON" property lookups
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235996

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Speedometer2/Vanilla* subtests are highly reliant on JSON.stringify() for "storage":
        it accounts for 10-15% of running time. EmberJS* subtests rely on JSON.stringify() as
        well, although they are significantly slower overall, and also encounter only a few
        different structures.

        This patch caches "toJSON" properties on Structure's rare data; it's the same technique
        we are using in toPrimitive() to avoid "toString" / "valueOf" lookups. The microbenchmark,
        which was carefully extracted from Speedometer2/Vanilla* subtests, progressed by 3.7%.

        While we could come up with a solution that doesn't involve creating StructureRareData
        for all structures we stringify, like keeping a list of StructureIDs w/o "toJSON" method,
        which will be correct as long as `m_hasFastObjectProperties || m_isJSArray` is true for all
        seen objects, that would probably miss some edge case, won't persist between JSON.stringify()
        calls, and won't speed-up structures with "toJSON" methods like Dates.

        1. Remove the AssemblyHelpers version of sanitizeStack.  Instead, make the 3
           JIT operation functions call sanitizeStackForVM() instead.  This ensures

        2. Add sanity check RELEASE_ASSERTs to VM::setLastStackTop() with a capture of
           the relevant variables for crash analysis.

        3. Fix logSanitizeStack() so that it no longer relies on vm.topCallFrame.
           vm.topCallFrame may not be properly initialized at all the places that
           sanitizeStackForVM() is called.

        4. Add a JSLock check to sanitizeStackForVM(), and return early if not owned by
           the current thread.  If the JSLock is not owned by the current thread, we can't
           rely on vm.lastStackTop() being a sane value.  Hence, it's not possible to
           do stack sanitization correctly.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Fix lowering of baddi* and bsubi* instructions in the riscv64 offlineasm
        backend. Node.riscCloneWithOperandsLowered() doesn't do the job properly
        when the result of the arithmetic operation has to be stored back into
        memory. In that case, right now these instructions are lowered into a
        sequence that loads from memory, performs the arithmetic operation,
        sets up the branch and only then stores the result back into memory,
        which means the result never gets written back if the branch is taken.
        Most prominently this breaks the execution counter through which JIT
        entry is decided.

        The riscv64LowerMisplacedAddresses() pass is specialized to cover
        baddi* and bsubi* instructions whose destination operand is an address.

        and only then branching on the given condition.

        See the proposal for a more detailed description: https://github.com/WebAssembly/branch-hinting.

        This allows parsing a "code_annotation.branch_hint" custom section,
        as per the code annotation proposal: https://github.com/WebAssembly/annotations.
        This section provides per function information about how likely a branch at a
        given offset is to be taken. It is similar to branch weight metadata in LLVM.

        Adjusted build path variables to handle the case when building for Catalyst.
        Did this by refactoring how the optional system content path is added as a prefix to paths.
        As a result, modified the create symlink script to not be dependent on the target location,
        since it isn't created when doing a catalyst build.  Instead the script creates the parent
        directory of the symlink if it doesn't exisst.

        [JSC] Do not run testPingPongStackOverflow while running multithreaded MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235633

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest is failing occasionally in CLoop test. This is because of the following.

        1. CLoop is slow, so multithreaded tests are running longly.
        2. Then, this multithreaded tests overlap with testPingPongStackOverflow.
        3. testPingPongStackOverflow changes global Options::maxPerThreadStackUsage to test stack-overflow behavior.
           This test is strongly assuming that there is only one thread using this VM. But this is wrong since
           MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest is running concurrently. Then this configuration change affects on
           the running MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest.
        4. Stack-overflow error happens in MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest if the changed option is observed in that test.

        We should not run testPingPongStackOverflow until MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest finishes since it assumes
        that there is only one user of this VM.

        This patch also cleans up / adds diagnosis of failures in MultithreadedMultiVMExecutionTest.

        [JSC] Wasm module import should be done in sync when WebAssembly.instantiate gets module
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235506

        According to the spec, module imports need to be done synchronously when WebAssembly.instantiate

        into WebAssemblyModuleRecord::initializeImports and WebAssemblyModuleRecord::initializeExports. The former
        does not require CalleeGroups so we can execute before compiling CalleeGroups.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch fixes several regexp crashes on ARMv7 due to an incorrect
        offset to retrieve the 5th argument from the stack: in ARMv7, only
        4 arguments are passed via registers r0-r3i, and any other argument is
        placed on the stack, however, YarrJIT was trying to get the 5th arg
        from a fixed offset, so because the generateEnter() method pushed
        register into the stack, the offset was wrong. This patch fixes how
        the offset is calculated for MIPS and ARMv7.

        This patch also introduces some small changes:

        1. Added static_asserts that the YarrJIT calls do indeed have 5 arguments
        and that the 5th argument has the type that we expect (MatchingContextHolder*).

        [RISCV64] Add MacroAssemblerRISCV64 branch-testing operations

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Implement MacroAssemblerRISCV64 branch-testing operations. The branching
        instructions being intentionally simple in RISC-V, and with no status
        register, scratch register has to be used to hold the testing result
        and perform a branch based on its value. This will disallow use of these
        implementations from Air, but that has to be address inside Air itself.

        When performing tests for values that are smaller than 64 bits in width,
        the tested value is zero-extended or, when necessary, loaded as an
        unsigned value, to impose zeroed upper bits that eliminate masking
        values that are too wide or get sign-extended when used as immediates.
        Post-masking, these shorter-width values still have to be sign-extended
        to accommodate branch instructions that are used when testing
        signedness.

        The test result value is then passed on, along with the desired
        condition, to the new branchTestFinalize() helper method that finally
        generates the appropriate branch.

        Add MacroAssemblerRISCV64 implementations that cover unsigned bitfield,

        to be used.

        For the unsigned bitfield operations, the desired result is achieved
        through shifting and masking. Scratch registers are only needed in
        case of the mask immediate being too large, but that will be properly
        handled by the higher-level JITs. For other operations covered in this
        patch  we have to use scratch registers and custom loops to implement

        Define PAS_BMALLOC in all projects since JavaScriptCore includes some files which can require this macro variable.
        Previously, JSDollarVM.cpp includes these files first, then at that time, we can define PAS_BMALLOC.
        However, after enabling jit-heap, these files are included before JSDollarVM.cpp and include pas_config.h without
        PAS_BMALLOC definition, which later causes the problem when including pas_lock.h since non PAS_BMALLOC libpas requires
        darwin specific locking.

        Since defining PAS_BMALLOC does not matter to whether using libpas or not, this patch just defines it globally.
        And for Apple ports, we define this when we define BENABLE_LIBPAS.

        [RISCV64] riscv64 backend should lower offlineasm instructions

        <rdar://problem/87440612>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        In the riscv64 offlineasm backend, instead of handling higher-level
        offlineasm instructions with different operand combinations and manually
        juggling temp registers, use the approach of aggressively lowering these
        opcodes into sequences of RISC-V instructions.

        Addresses and immediate values are lowered into usable forms where
        necessary. Different lowering phases handle any offlineasm instruction
        so that the resulting opcodes can be, with accompanying operands, used
        trivially to construct the RISC-V assembly.

        Lowered RISC-V opcodes use the 'rv_' prefix so that they can be easily
        diassociated from any offlineasm opcode that might share the same name.
        The prefix is removed when the assembly is finally generated.

        [XCBuild] Add "product dependencies" which influence workspace build order
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235094

        Some ancillary targets (e.g. script-only targets like Derived Sources) do not have implicit
        dependencies visible to Xcode. In workspace builds, we need to give XCBuild additional
        information to ensure that they always run after their dependencies.

        This patch adds "Product Dependencies" phases, which are Copy Files phases that copy the
        _product_ of another dependency. The product names are also added to
        EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES, making the actual copy a no-op, but these phases give XCBuild
        enough metadata to infer the relationship between targets.

        For example, JavaScriptCore's "Generate Unified Sources" target depends on headers from WTF,
        so it lists libWTF.a in its Product Dependencies. Xcode sees the relationship between the
        target doing the copy (Generate Unified Sources) and the target which produces the product
        (WTF) and schedules them accordingly.

        Because these dependencies are _implicit_ and the copy phases are no-ops, they do not
        influence command-line or production builds where each project is built separately.

        [RISCV64] riscv64 backend should lower offlineasm instructions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234952

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        In the riscv64 offlineasm backend, instead of handling higher-level
        offlineasm instructions with different operand combinations and manually
        juggling temp registers, use the approach of aggressively lowering these
        opcodes into sequences of RISC-V instructions.

        Addresses and immediate values are lowered into usable forms where
        necessary. Different lowering phases handle any offlineasm instruction
        so that the resulting opcodes can be, with accompanying operands, used
        trivially to construct the RISC-V assembly.

        Lowered RISC-V opcodes use the 'rv_' prefix so that they can be easily
        diassociated from any offlineasm opcode that might share the same name.
        The prefix is removed when the assembly is finally generated.

        Allow loop tier up to the Air tier
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234587
        <rdar://problem/86968638>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds loop tier up from LLInt -> Air. To implement this, we use
        EntrySwitch to point at each loop header, making each loop an entrypoint.
        This is unlike BBQ->OMG tier up, where we compile a special OSR entry OMG
        callee. This seems like a good architecture for the Air tier, since we might end
        up with slightly worse throughput, but we won't need a different compilation
        for loops vs call entrypoints.
        
        This patch also fixes a bug in Air's O0 register allocation where it
        didn't properly account for all named registers in an instruction. There
        was a silly bug where we asked each arg if it were a temp, instead of
        asking the Inst for each of its temps, since an Arg can be an address
        but still use temps.

        On builds made with the legacy build system (currently any CLI build for Apple platforms),
        postprocess-headers.sh always runs, even when no headers have been copied. PBXBuild doesn't
        have the necessary granularity to let us avoid running it when there are no headers to copy,
        however, this patch improves execution time by only running the postprocess rule when a
        header has changed since the last time it ran.

        This patch adds support to Air for Wasm exceptions. The implementation
        is very similar to how we implement it in the B3 Wasm tier. This patch
        shares code with the B3 tier where it can.
        
        This patch also fixes a bug where you the early clobbered registers
        of a patchpoint could prevent the prior instruction from register allocating.
        For example, you can have the instructions I1, I2. Where I2 clobbers the
        entire register file. It doesn't mean I1 shouldn't be able to allocate
        registers. Instead, the clobber should occur after I1 executes. This patch
        fixes the issue.

        Expand the set of objects we take JSArray::fastSlice() path for
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234539

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Currently, Array.prototype's slice() / splice() methods take a fast path only for
        JSArray source objects. With this change, gcSafeMemcpy-based path is taken for any
        object with ordinary getOwnPropertySlotByIndex() method, which speeds up the common
        case of `[].slice.call(arguments)` by 140% (in strict mode only, see ClonedArguments).

        Also, once is https://webkit.org/b/234538 resolved, calling Array.prototype.slice()
        on a static NodeList, which is a common idiom to acquire map() / filter() methods,
        will become faster as well.

        This patch was thoroughly evaluated to be spec-perfect and memory-safe:

          - indexing mode check and holesMustForwardToPrototype() guarantee that there
            are no observable userland code to be invoked;
          - fastSlice() signature is upgraded to uint64_t so `nullptr` is returned in case
            of large "length", resulting in a RangeError being thrown on the slow path;
          - to handle the case of source array being shrinked after "length" lookup (see r175420),
            OOB read check is moved to JSArray::fastSlice() and refined to rely on vectorLength()
            so the double "length" lookup is avoided (added a test for this).

        All this (and more) is well covered by the test262 suite.

        This change improves Speedometer2/EmberJS-Debug-TodoMVC score by 0.5%: although the test
        is slow on its own, `[].slice.call(arguments)` is performed ~56k times per run.

        reserves its first N entries for the N return values. The patchpoint's
        children contains no results though, so we don't need to account for
        the number of return values when indexing into the children() vector
        of the PatchpointValue. To make this code simpler, we keep track of the
        number of live values we need when throwing. These values are both
        at the end of StackmapGenerationParams and at the end of the children()
        vector. So we just look at the last "number of live values" in both
        vectors to get the correct ValueRep and correct type. The code for
        calls also didn't account for the fact that call arguments will be
        appended after the live values we're building into a stackmap. This
        patch fixes that code to always put the live values last.

        [JSC] Remove m_calleeSaveRegisters from CodeBlock::JITData and rename it to BaselineJITData
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234555

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch removes m_calleeSaveRegisters from CodeBlock::JITData, and moving it to each JITCode.
        This is reasonable since m_calleeSaveRegisters information belongs to JITCode, not CodeBlock.
        And in LLInt, Baseline, and DFG cases, m_calleeSaveRegisters is the same. So we do not have this
        field in these JITCode. Only FTL can have m_calleeSaveRegisters.

        By removing m_calleeSaveRegisters from CodeBlock::JITData, now it only includes Baseline JIT related
        data. So this patch renames CodeBlock::JITData to BaselineJITData.

        We also use TrailingArray for BaselineJITData so that we can remove one level indirection when loading
        JITConstantPool from JITData.

        Necessary guards and missing bits are added to make things buildable,

        Even when enabled at build-time in the future, there'll likey be open
        issues that will require disabling different features at run-time.

        MacroAssemblerRISCV64::setCarry() no-op method is added for now. Carry
        flag retrieval isn't exactly possible on RISC-V, so the uses of it will

        on ARM64, the value matches MacroAssemblerRISCV64::dataTempRegister.

        In B3, we follow ARM64 in the pinned extended-offset-address use and
        stack argument lowering.

        in WASM, we can again mirror ARM64 around LLInt callee registers and

        Sprinkle RISCV64 conditions around WebAssembly.asm as appropriate.
        For division, we can reuse the divi(s)/divq(s) instructions already

        instructions, so the necessary offlineasm instructions are added
        and used for RISCV64.

        In the offlineasm riscv64 backend, the division and remainder
        instruction handling is improved to properly cover signed and unsigned
        variants. For other instructions used in LLint WebAssembly
        implementation like left or right rotation, trailing- or leading-zero
        counting, order-based floating-point comparison, load-reserved and
        store-conditional operations, the riscv64WASMPlaceholder helper is used
        to generate an ebreak instruction that will halt the program at runtime
        but will not throw a build-time error. Proper implementations will be
        provided once WebAssembly support on RISCV64 is taken up.

        Make DeferredWorkTimer::addPendingWork() return a Ticket.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234628
        rdar://84260429

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        1. Make Ticket a unique token instead of the JSObject* target object.
           The Ticket is now a pointer to the TicketData in the pending work list.

        2. Instead of taking a Ticket argument, DeferredWorkTimer::addPendingWork() now
           takes a JSObject* `target` argument explicitly, and returns the Ticket for the
           added TicketData instead.

           All the relevant DeferredWorkTimer APIS already take a Ticket as an argument.
           This ensures that addPendingWork() is called before we start doing work with
           these APIs (especially scheduleWorkSoon()).

        3. Previously, addPendingWork() will only save one instance of TicketData for
           a given JSObject* key.  With this patch, we'll register a new TicketData
           instance for every call to addPendingWork(), and return a unique Ticket for it.

           This is needed because it may be possible for 2 different clients to call
           addPendingWork() and scheduleWorkSoon() with the same target JSObject* but with
           different sets of dependencies.

           Secondly, even is the both sets of dependencies are identical, a client may
           call addPendingWork() and scheduleWorkSoon() with the same JSObject* target
           more than once because it intended to schedule more than 1 task to run.

           Note that DeferredWorkTimer::doWork() consumes the corresponding TicketData
           (i.e. removes it from the m_pendingTickets list) for each task as it is run.
           To ensure that the dependencies for each task is protected, we'll either need
           to ref count the TicketData for the same target object (and hold off on removing
           it from the list), or we'll need to register a different TicketData instance
           for each task.  Ref counting can solve the second issue above, but does not
           solve the first.  So, this patch goes with the more generic solution to allow
           each task to have its own TicketData instance (and, its own unique Ticket).

        4. Previously, if the client cancels pending work, we would remove the TicketData
           immediately from the m_pendingTickets list.  This opens up an opportunity for
           the same TicketData memory to be re-allocated by another client.  This, in turn,
           would make the Ticket token not unique and potentially allow a cancelled ticket
           to be reused before DeferredWorkTimer::doWork() is called.

           This patch changes DeferredWorkTimer::cancelPendingWork() to only clear the
           contents of the TicketData instead.  TicketData::scriptExecutionOwner being
           null is used as an indication that the ticket has been cancelled.  Since the
           TicketData itself is not "freed" yet, all TicketData will remain unique until
           DeferredWorkTimer::doWork().

           Consequently, DeferredWorkTimer::doWork() will now check for cancelled tickets
           and remove them from the m_pendingTickets list.

        5. JSFinalizationRegistry was previously calling DeferredWorkTimer::hasPendingWork()
           to check if it has already scheduled a task, so as not to reschedule again until
           after the previously scheduled task has been run.  This does not play nice
           with the new Ticket API, because this hasPendingWork() check needs to be done
           before calling addPendingWork(), and hence, the Ticket is not available yet.

           Fortunately, JSFinalizationRegistry should know if it has already scheduled
           a task itself.  This patch adds a m_hasAlreadyScheduledWork flag to 
           JSFinalizationRegistry that can be used for this check instead.

        [RISCV64] Add basic MacroAssemblerRISCV64 branching methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234474

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Add MacroAssemblerRISCV64 implementations for the basic branching
        methods. RelationalCondition enum values are aliased to the branching
        condition values in RISCV64Assembler. The makeBranch() helper method
        is added that generates the final branching instruction for the given
        condition and the two registers holding values for the comparison and
        returns the Jump object based on the label constructed at the location
        of the branching placeholder.

        Branching methods essentially consist of preparing the two registers
        and calling the makeBranch() method. For 8-bit and 32-bit comparisons
        the compared values have to be sign-extended into the scratch registers
        because the branching instructions don't operate on partial values. This
        might cause friction in higher JIT levels where the use of scratch
        registers is disallowed.

        The reason this can't partake in pure CSE is that WasmAddressValue reads pinned.
        To support this, we keep track of which blocks write pinned. If we're trying to
        replace a value V2 with V1 because it appears there is a redundancy, we check if
        any paths from V1 to V2 write pinned. If none do, we proceed with the replacement.

        RISCV64Assembler also gains helper methods that generate placeholders

        then invoked, enabling the user (MacroAssemblerRISCV64 implementation)
        to additionally generate the desired instruction sequence that utilizes
        the given placeholder.

        Implement Array.prototype.groupBy and Array.prototype.groupByToMap
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234327

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Implement new Array Grouping proposal <https://tc39.es/proposal-array-grouping/>, which just
        reached Stage 3.

        `Array.prototype.groupBy`/`Array.prototype.groupByToMap` will return a `{}`/`Map` where each
        value in the array is put into a "bucket" keyed by the return value of the provoded callback.

        ```js
        const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

        array.groupBy(n => n % 2 ? "odd" : "even") // { odd: [1, 3], even: [2, 4] }
        array.groupByToMap(n => n % 2 ? "odd" : "even") // new Map([["odd", [1, 3]], ["even", [2, 4]])

        [Shadow Realms] Wrapped functions must only throw TypeError from calling realm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234357

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This wrapping logic already exists for ShadowRealm.prototype.evaluate
        but not for calls to wrapped functions. at present, this requires some
        awkward manouvering to actually throw a typeerror from the shadow realm,
        since the wrapper code always runs in the incubating realm.

        Hopefully we can make this less messy soon by replacing this
        implementation with one more integrated with the runtime.

        This case wasn't covered by existing JSC or test262 tests; added
        coverage both upstream in t262 and in this patch.

        No tier has a fast path for OpInstanceofCustom and this is unlikely to change anytime soon.

        [JSC] Use FixedVector for wasm exception in Wasm::Instance
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234224

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Since we know # of exception tags when instantiating Wasm::Instance,
        we can use FixedVector instead of Vector. This is the same to Table,
        Functions etc.

        We also remove Wasm::Tag::m_id. Since we do not copy Wasm::Tag and
        we always allocate Wasm::Tag from heap, we can just use pointer
        comparison. Then, we do not need to have this m_id.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Following r281910 two additional slots were added
        to g_config in order to store these pointers for use in bmalloc and Gigacage. However, when
        USE(SYSTEM_MALLOC) is enabled, there are no slots reserved for Gigacage, and so this collided
        with g_wtfConfig and overwrote data there instead.

        This should fix crashes seen on Haiku, which enables USE(SYSTEM_MALLOC).

        The two floating-point temporary registers needed in some operations are
        listed. The rounding and comparison operations are left for later as
        they require a more complex implementation due to the necessary manual

        Teach the sampling profiler how to display origin data for B3 Wasm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234097

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This teaches the SamplingProfiler how to gather origin data for
        Wasm. We reuse the PCToCodeOriginMap from JS, and store the wasm
        function offset data inside of CodeOrigin's BytecodeIndex.
        
        For now, this patch is only doing this for B3, because the Air backend
        doesn't currently generate filled in OpcodeOrigin data. We'll fix that
        in: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234182
        
        Also, this capability isn't yet supported in Web Inspector. We'll want
        to do that in a future change as we improve Web Inspector's ability to
        debug Wasm code. When that time comes, we'll have to generate the
        PCToCodeOriginMap based on debugging info, and not just 'useSamplingProfiler'
        JSC option.
        
        The data now shows up like this for hottest bytecodes:

        Automatically forbid JS execution when we throw a TerminationException.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234188

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        For Worker threads, we throw a TerminationException when Worker.terminate() is
        called.  Once the TerminationException is thrown, we expect to completely unwind
        out of any JS frames on the stack, and we also expect the client to never call
        into JS again.  Previously, WebCore will call VM:setExecutionForbidden() to flag
        that we should not re-enter the VM anymore.  On JSC side, this executionForbidden()
        is used to prevent micro-tasks from firing.  On WebCore side, it is used to prevent
        many things from running, including firing events.

        Previously, we reply on WebCore side to catch the TerminationException, determine
        that it is the TerminationException, and then call VM:setExecutionForbidden().
        This is tedious and error prone as there may be places in WebCore that should call
        VM:setExecutionForbidden() but is missed.  This has been the source of some bugs
        with the handling of the Worker termination in the past.

        In this patch, we change VM to setExecutionForbidden() immediately when we throw
        the TerminationException, but only if VM::m_executionForbiddenOnTermination is set.
        Currently, we'll only set VM:m_executionForbiddenOnTermination for Workers because
        for legacy reasons, other clients of JSC has the ability to re-enter the VM after
        a TerminationException unwinds out (which is ok to do when used under some
        controlled conditions).  Until we can determine that it is safe to adopt this
        "execution forbidden on termination" behavior universally, we'll adopt it only for
        workers.

        In a subsequent patch, we can also look into removing all the places in WebCore
        that checks for TerminationException in order to call VM:setExecutionForbidden().
        We'll leave those in place for now though they should be redundant after this patch.

        Also add some ASSERTs to document invariants regarding states used in the handing
        of TerminationException.

        [JSC] Introduce WriteBarrierStructureID
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233918

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch adds WriteBarrierStructureID class, which is similar to WriteBarrier<Structure>, but internally,
        it holds StructureID, so sizeof(WriteBarrierStructureID) is 4. This class is useful to use StructureID for
        memory saving while keeping WriteBarrier<Structure>'s useful features (automatically inserts write-barrier when
        setting etc.). This also paves the way to introducing DOMStructures array with WriteBarrierStructureID instead
        of costly HashMap<ClassInfo*, WriteBarrier<Structure>>.

        We can use memmove in this scenario because the bitpattern of the
        data between the signed and unsigned values will be the same.

        This patch also fixes a bug where we were looking at the wrong

        [JSC] Add LLInt IC for try_get_by_id of own cacheable value
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233830

        Performance is neutral with JIT enabled as well as on current uses of try_get_by_id in JSC

        [RISCV64] Add more MacroAssemblerRISCV64 helper infrastructure
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233805

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Introduce RISCV64Assembler::ImmediateLoader, a helper class that
        generates the operations necessary for loading any immediate value into
        some register. This can be as simple as using ADDI to load 12-bit values
        or a combination of LUI, ADDI and possibly additional combinations of
        LSHIFT and ADDI instructions. There's also a placeholder mode which
        generates no-ops for unused operation slots, in order to enable
        future patching and repatching for other immediate values.

        MacroAssemblerRISCV64::Imm is introduced as a private helper struct that
        groups together validity and construction operations for the different
        immediate types implemented in the RISCV64Instructions namespace.

        In MacroAssemblerRISCV64, resolveAddress() overloads are provided to
        help generate most optimal address loading sequencing. RISC-V addressing
        mode utilizes a base register and a 12-bit signed offset. When needed,
        additional computation is done on the address object's parameters and
        stored in the destination register through which the load can then be
        performed.

        Helper TempRegister and LazyTempRegister structs are added to the
        MacroAssemblerRISCV64 class, along with the respective temps() and
        lazyTemp() methods. temps() returns the TempRegister object, with the
        template parameters defining which of the two scratch register types
        should be allowed for use through this object. Release-time assert
        on the m_allowScratchRegister value is done at the point of calling
        temps(). lazyTemp() only handles one scratch register, and the assert
        is done only when the register is actually used, and not just reserved
        for use. This enables simpler implementations that better handle both
        modes of scratch register usage (allowed or disallowed).

        To get things rolling, the first set of MacroAssemblerRISCV64 methods
        is implemented. Addition, subtraction and multiplication definitions
        are provided, with the templated no-op declarations removed.

        Remove unneeded virtual allocator methods from Subspace.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233891
        rdar://86117970

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Since the virtual allocate() and allocateFor() methods are now deleted, we can
        also rename the inline allocateNonVirtual() and allocatorForNonVirtual() methods
        to simply allocate() and allocateFor().  Similarly, rename
        allocatorForNonVirtualConcurrently() to allocatorForConcurrently().

        There are 2 places that still invokes the non-inline version of
        CompleteSubspace::allocatorFor().  For this reason, we introduce a
        CompleteSubsace::allocatorForNonInline() to keep the linkage the same.  There's a
        chance that the compiler/linker may already inline the method in 1 or both of
        these places, but we'll offer allocatorForNonInline() to keep the code expressing
        the same thing and let the compiler/linker decide whether to inline it or not just
        as before.

        This is purely a re-factoring patch.  There are no behavior changes, except for
        the removal of those 2 entries from the vtbls.

        [JSC] Generated code size reductions for baseline JIT (all architectures)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233474

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch introduces a few improvements that reduce the generated
        code size.

        Target independent improvements to the Baseline JIT:

        1. Some bytecodes that are very frequent (e.g.: get_by_id, call) share
        the same instructions at the tail end of the fast and slow paths.
        Instead of duplicating these in the slow path, then branch to the next
        sequential bytecode on the fast path, make the slow path branch to and
        reuse these common instructions, which then naturally fall through to
        the next sequential bytecode.

        2. Minor tweaks in a few places to remove redundant reloading of
        immediates and remove redundant moves.

        3. Remove a small number of redundant unconditional branches from some
        DataIC fast paths.

        ARMv7/Thumb-2 specific improvements:

        4. Add assembler support for LDRD and STRD (load/store a pair of
        32-bit GPRs) and use them throughout via loadValue/storeValue. This
        yields denser code as it often eliminates repeated temporary register
        setups (especially for a BaseIndex access), and also due to point 4
        below. This is also potentially a performance improvement on
        micro-architectures with a 64-bit LSU data-path.

        5. Instructions using only r0-r7 as operands can often use a short,
        16-bit encoding in Thumb-2, so prefer to use low order registers
        as temporaries wherever possible.

        The net effect of this patch is that the emitted baseline code during
        a run of JetStream2 is ~6.6% smaller on x86_64, ~5.1% smaller on
        ARM64, and ~24% smaller on ARMv7/Thumb-2. On ARMv7/Thumb-2, DFG code
        is also ~5.3% smaller, while on other architectures the DFG code is
        unaffected.

        On ARMv7/Thumb-2, this patch also yields an ~2% improvement in
        JetStream2 scores on my test machine.

        Move Subspaces from VM to Heap.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233648
        rdar://85875751

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Subspaces are Heap data structures to begin with, and this refactoring is needed
        in preparation for the global GC.

        1. Embed HeapCellType and IsoHeapCellType instances in Heap directly instead of
           malloc'ing them separately and referencing them via unique_ptrs.  These
           instances are always instantiated unconditionally anyway.  This change
           eliminates the unneeded busy work to allocate them separately.

        2. Introduce a HeapSubspaceTypes.h that #include all the types that we have
           subspaces for.  This makes it so that Heap.cpp's #include list is not flooded
           with these types with subspaces, and that it'll be easier to discern between
           these Subspace types from other data structures needed for implementing Heap.

        3. Add VM accessor methods for subspaces that forward to Heap.  This will make it
           easier for us to redirect to a thread local allocator later for the global GC.

        4. Remove unneeded #includes in VM.h.

        5. Remove unused CodeBlockSet::iterateViaSubspaces().

        Structures should be allocated out of an aligned pool of memory so StructureID->Structure* is fast.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233379

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch changes the 64-bit pointer variant of StructureID to
        just be the bottom bits of a reserved address space for
        structures. With this system the decoding of a StructureID is just
        adding the bits to the start of the structure address space (saved
        in JSCConfig).  We also take care to ignore any high bits of a
        StructureID outside the reserved address range.  This prevents a
        data corruption from causing us to read past the structure space,
        much like the gigacage.

        Now that StructureIDs can be directly determined from the
        Structure* (and visa versa) we no longer need StructureIDTable,
        which has been removed. Also, as Structures are still IsoHeaped
        but not allocated by fastMalloc, there's a new
        AlignedMemoryAllocator subclass that gets MarkedBlocks out of a
        simple static allocator.

        Rename "queueTaskToEventLoop" to "queueMicrotaskToEventLoop"
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233639

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This change improves grep-ability and avoids confusion since JSDOMWindowBase's
        queueMicrotaskToEventLoop() is capable only of scheduling microtasks (hence its signature).
        ECMA-262 has no notion of macrotasks, and now JSC hasn't as well.

        No behavior change.

        GetMyArgumentByValOutOfBounds needs to check for negative indices

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Negative indices inside of GetMyArgumentByValOutOfBounds would cause
        us to have the resulting value be undefined, instead of a full blown
        lookup that properly consults the prototype chain and such. The reason for
        this is negative indices would show up as "out of bounds", which would
        lead this node to result in undefined. But negative indices really should
        be treated as string property names, and can't be treated like normal out
        of bounds positive integers.
        
        This patch makes it so we speculate that we don't see negative indices. If
        we do see negative indices, we stop performing the transformation inside
        of arguments elimination so we don't end up in an OSR exit loop.

        [JSC] Unify most Baseline ops between JSVALUE64 and JSVALUE32_64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233424

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch unifies the Baseline JIT implementations of most bytecode
        ops between the JSVALUE32_64 and JSVALUE64 platforms. There are very
        few changes to the generated code on JSVALUE64 (and all are fairly
        trivial, e.g.: removal of redundant moves in the slow path), apart
        from machine register substitutions. My measurements on x86_64
        indicate the patch is performance neutral there (which is what we
        expect).

        On ARMv7/Thumb-2 JetStream2 shows a 0.4% improvement. This is due to
        some of the improved implementations picked up from the JSVALUE64
        versions.

        Also remove various unused code.

        Reviewed by Alexey Shvayka.

        Class public field implementation did not have optimization for initializing class fields: using
        runtime call to initialize fields instead of IC. This patch leverages put_by_id / put_by_val with
        direct flag so that we can enable IC.

        Currently, we are not changing original putDirect semantics since it is out of this patch's scope.
        We will look into it and probably changing it in a separate patch, but not in this patch.

        [RISCV64] Populate RISCV64Assembler with instruction-generation methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233256

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Sprinkle RISCV64Assembler class with helper methods for generating the
        desired instruction values.

        Immediate types from the RISCV64Instructions namespace are introduced
        into the class for easier usage here and in the MacroAssemblerRISCV64
        class. Instruction-generating methods roughly match the different
        instruction types in the RISCV64Instructions namespace.

        A few optimizations are done around floating-point instructions. We can
        use one base method which expects the desired FP size as a template
        parameter, and the appropriate RISCV64Instructions type can then be
        selected based on that size value. Different combinations for FP move
        and conversion instructions are also grouped behind a single method,
        with thorough compile-time validation done to prevent generating
        invalid instructions.

        A few helper methods intended for masking, sign-extension and
        zero-extension are also added. The Condition enum is fixed to list only
        RISCV-viable conditions, with the values ordered so that a simple
        XOR-by-one of a given value will produce the value of the inverted
        condition.

        [JSC] Make sharing of unlinked baseline code possible on JSVALUE32_64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232624

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch contains a few different changes, which taken together make
        it possible to share the unlinked baseline JIT code between different
        CodeBlocks on JSVALUE32_64 platforms. Note that by default, code
        sharing is disabled on JSVALUE32_64 due to the increased executable
        memory usage it may cause. The reson the executable memory usage might
        increase is that the UnlinkedCodeBlock has a longer lifetime than the
        corresponding linked CodeBlocks (due to the CodeCache I'm told), and
        when using code sharing, it holds a reference to the JITed code. This
        then prevents recycling of executable memory while the
        UnlinkedCodeBlock is live, while without sharing we could have
        reclaimed some of the executable memory earlier.

        The high level changes in this pach are:

        1. A lot of baseline implementations of the opcodes that needed
        changing for the unlinked baseline are now unified between the
        JSVALUE64 and JSVALUE32_64 platforms. Note that while this required
        adding some abstraction, the code generated by the baseline JIT on
        JSVALUE64 should be identical using this abstraction compared to
        before.

        2. I added a JSRInfo class which defines standard names for certain
        JSValueReg instances. This enables a lot of the unification in the
        point above to be expressed in a very simple manner, with very little
        transformation of the existing code. Again, this should have no impact
        on the generated code on JSVALUE64, apart from some register
        substitutions.

        3. The sizes of the resolve_scope and get_from_scope ops increased
        significantly with the unlinked baseline. This can cause issues on
        some JSVALUE32_64 targets where memory is more precious, so for these
        two ops I swapped in the implementations under EXTRA_CTI_THUNKS, which
        implement these using shared stubs. These stubs work on all platforms
        that support ENABLE(JIT), so they are now the only implementation and
        I have removed the basic bloated versions.

        4. Removed some unused code and fields I discovered while working on
        this, strictly speaking this is not necessary for the functional
        change.

        [JSC] Shadow realms: set correct Function prototype on wrapped functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233143

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        At present, the Function prototype set on each of the returned wrapped
        functions will be the Function object from the realm the shadow realm
        builtin is from--to comply with the latest draft of the shadow realms
        spec [1], wrapped function objects should have the Function prototype
        from the realm the wrapper object is destined for, instead.

        At present, this requires tracking both the calling (destination) and
        target (source) realm and switching between the two as function
        arguments are wrapped (when the notion of source and destination realm
        also flips)

        Adds a simple builtin (moveFunctionToRealm) that can switch the Function
        prototype given only the Shadow Realm object corresponding to the
        correct global object.

        Also marks the corresponding part of test262 as passing.

        AirFixObviousSpills should be optimized
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228052

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        There were two problems with AirFixObviousSpills:
        - merge() had a quadratic blow-up, as for each element in a vector, it was searching it in a different vector.
        - it would visit blocks even when their state at head had not changed.

        I fixed the first problem by making sure that the vectors are sorted before calling merge, and making use of that invariant in the search of the vectors
        (see filterVectorAgainst)
        This reduced the total time spent in that phase from 390ms to 230ms, and the worst case time spent in that phase for one function from 100ms to 30ms (all of the results in this Changelog are for JetStream2 on a M1 MBP).

        I fixed the second problem even more easily by adding a m_shouldVisit BitVector. I also moved the m_wasVisited boolean that was in State to a m_notBottom BitVector for simplicity and symmetry.
        That change further reduced the total/max time from 230ms/30ms to 140ms/16ms.

        [JSC/Air] Optimize enableMovesOnValueAndAdjacents in IRC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228615

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The Iterated Register Coalescing (IRC) register allocator spends a very significant fraction of its time in JS2 in enableMovesOnValueAndAdjacents (816ms out of 2.07s spent in register allocation for Wasm code in one run I looked at with Instruments).
        The reason is that if this function is called on N nodes that are neighbors of each other, then enableMovesOnValue (which is kinda expensive as it iterates a SmallSet which is not always small) will be called N times on each of the N nodes. This can trivially be fixed by keeping track of which nodes need enableMovesOnValue called on them and only calling it on them once.

        It is a bit tricky to measure the performance impact of this, as it heavily depends on whether some very large functions reach Air or not, so there is a lot of noise.
        Here are the numbers out of 4 runs of JS2 (cli version) on an M1 MBP with --airForceIRCAllocator=1:
        Baseline       : total time in allocateRegistersByGraphColoring ranges from 2090ms to 3018ms, most time for a single function ranges from 631ms to 849ms
        With this patch: total time in allocateRegistersByGraphColoring ranges from 1580ms to 2333ms, most time for a single function ranges from 337ms to 560ms
        So despite the noise it seems quite clearly a win.

        DFGByteCodeParser.cpp should avoid resizing the Operands<> of every BasicBlock on every inlining
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228053

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The dfg bytecode parser only makes use of block->variablesAtTail.
        But currently it updates the size of variablesAtHead, valuesAtHead, valuesAtTail and intersectionOfPastValuesAtHead every single time it changes the number of Tmps and/or Locals.
        This happens notably whenever it inlines a function.

        It is not nearly as cheap as it looks, as each resizing may reallocate a Vector, requires filling the new slots with zeros, and requires moving the existing values (which are all 0) to the new Vector.
        This was obvious when looking at profiling of JS2: bzero + memmove are the two hottest C++ functions, and the manipulation of Operands is partly responsible.

        This patch fixes this by only resizing block->variablesAtTail during the execution of the bytecode parser, and initializing all of the other operands at the very end of it.
        It also merges the adjustment of numLocals and of numTmps for variablesAtTail during inlining, to avoid accidentally moving data twice.

        On JetStream2 on an M1 MBP, it changes the total time spent in the DFGByteCodeParser from 1240-1260ms to 1155-1170ms.

        [JSC] Revise JSON.parse atomize policy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233231

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch improves JSON.parse performance by the following two changes.

        1. Introduce JSONAtomStringCache. It is inspired from HTMLAtomStringCache. It offers cheap
           fixed-sized cache stored in VM. Since it is in VM, we do not need to clear it every time
           we call JSON.parse. We clear this cache when full GC happens. It contributes to
           flight-todomvc-json-parse by 5%.
        2. Do not atomize long string. Profiling of JSON.parse said that most of time is used for
           atomizing of Strings. There is a tradeoff that, atomizing strings can reduce duplicate string
           allocations, but it has a performance penalty. V8 limits atomizing for <= 10 length strings,
           and SpiderMonkey does not atomize strings. In this patch, we aligned our atomizing policy to
           V8, so we do not atomize strings if the length is longer than 10. It contributes to
           flight-todomvc-json-parse by 50%.

        Many microbenchmarks show the improvement.

        [JSC] Use CallLinkInfo in LLInt
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232746

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch integrates normal CallLinkInfo into LLInt and remove adhoc LLIntCallLinkInfo.
        So that we can simplify our IC software stack, and unifying call IC mechanism into one CallLinkInfo.

        1. LLInt can fully use our polymorphic call IC, and we no longer need to reset call IC when
           tiering up from LLInt to Baseline JIT since both now uses the same CallLinkInfo data structure.
           DFG and FTL can also retrieve call information from this CallLinkInfo.
        2. LLInt varargs calls get the same level of optimization to Baseline. Previously it does not have
           call IC.
        3. When JIT is disabled, we disable polymorphic call IC since it requires dynamic code generation.
           In that case, we only use monomorphic one, which is the same to the old LLIntCallLinkInfo.
        4. CallLinkInfo::doneLocation is set up only after Baseline JIT. We adjust call IC code so that
           we no longer rely on doneLocation when using DataIC. This allows us to smoothly tiering up
           from LLInt to Baseline JIT while using the same CallLinkInfo.
           We set up doneLocation in Baseline JIT just because DFG OSR exit requires when exiting to
           Baseline JIT code.
        5. We remove CallLinkInfo from JIT constant pool, and we store CallLinkInfo in metadata so that
           LLInt and Baseline JIT quickly access to that and keeping unlinked Baseline JIT working.
        6. We implement LLInt version of call IC thunks so that we can use them even when JIT is disabled.

        Speedometer2 is neutral. JetStream2 is 0.7% progressed.

        Prevent fused multiply add during ParseInt
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232951

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        When parsing the string in parseInt, gcc can wrongfully generate
        a fused multiply-add instruction, causing the conversion to be wrong
        for some high values. An add followed by a multiply gives the correct
        result and it is the code generated most of the times.

        This patch adds a volatile qualifier to the number variable, so the
        compiler doesn't try to optimize it, and enables a failing test on
        mips.

        Alternative solutions that I tried but gcc seems to ignore: #pragma
        STDC FP_CONTRACT OFF, compiling with -ffp-contract=off, and setting function
        attributes __attribute__((optimize("fp-contract=off"))) and
        __attribute__((optimize("-ffp-contract=off"))), so volative seems to be
        a good compromise.

        The issue was found when cross compiling to mips with gcc 8.4.0 and
        options -ffp-contract=off -mmadd4.

        allocateCell() and tryAllocateCell() can fetch Heap& from VM& themselves.  This
        allows us to make all the client code more terse, and also makes it easier to
        redirect the underlying heap to allocate from later for global GC work.
        Additionally, this will help make the global GC patch less of a mega patch and
        easier to review later.

        These are ALWAYS_INLINE functions that will forward the call to the Heap versions.
        Adding these allows us to make all the client code more terse, and also makes it
        easier to redirect the underlying writeBarrier implementation later for global GC
        work.  Additionally, this will help make the global GC patch less of a mega patch
        and easier to review later.

        Also remove unused Heap::writeBarrierWithoutFence().

        This is a refactoring patch.  There is no behavior change.

        Inline RegExp.test JIT code in DFG and FTL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230469

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Restructured YarrJIT from inheriting from MacroAssembler to having a MacroAssembler
        member.  Added a new path to Yarr JIT code to compile inline code by changing how the
        code is entered and exited.  Added statistic to the normal compilation path to record
        the size of the matching code generated, the amount of stack space needed, and if
        the code can be inlined.  This patch only inlines 8bit code, as this seems to cover
        the most common performance sensitive cases.  Adding 16 bit, non-Unicode inlining
        would be straightforward.  The code is structured to take the inlined path for the
        case of non-rope string arguments.  For other cases, we fall back to calling out
        to C++ paths.

        Here are the perf results running the newly added regexp-test-inlined micro
        benchmark (time in msec):
                        Baseline       With this patch     Result
            ARM64   137.3849+-3.0740   64.9282+-0.7348  2.12x faster
            X86-64  220.2616+-19.2814 105.2034+-6.8722  2.09x faster

        As part of this change, found that the strength reduction didn't work properly for the
        existing cases for RegExpExec, RegExpTest and related since we added that checks for
        overriding the RegExp object.  Clobberize for tryGetById was clobber top, but added
        an exception for RegExp.lastIndex.  This fix allowed many of the strength reductions
        cases to start working again, namely the costant folding cases.

        Move m_doesGC from Heap to VM.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232975
        rdar://85277492

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        m_doesGC is only needed for ENABLE(DFG_DOES_GC_VALIDATION), and is used for checking
        if the VM thread's execution is in a state that can allow GC to run.  Hence, it is
        more related to VM thread execution as opposed to the state of the Heap.  This patch
        moves m_doesGC from Heap to VM to get it out of the way of upcoming Global GC work.

        Also change DeferGC, DeferGCForAWhile, and GCDeferralContext to take a VM& instead
        of a Heap&.  DeferGC and GCDeferralContext need to access VM& in order to call
        VM::verifyCanGC().  DeferGCForAWhile does not need VM&, but we're changing it to be
        consistent with DeferGC.  There should be no perf impact for this change.

        Using WASM function size as the cap for choosing a register allocator causes performance regressions.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217290
        <rdar://problem/69934870>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch just increases --maximumTmpsForGraphColoring from 25k to 60k.

        It was originally lowered to prevent jetsams in some wasm webpages such as mruby-wasm.aotoki.dev.
        These jetsams were caused by excessive memory consumption by the interference graphs used by AirAllocateRegistersByGraphColoring and AirAllocateStackByGraphColoring.
        I massively optimized these interference graphs in the following two patches (effect on mruby-wasm.aotoki.dev):
        - https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/277714/webkit (262MB + 262MB -> 20MB + 10MB in register allocator)
        - https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/278186/webkit (221MB + 399MB -> 6.5MB + 10.5MB in stack slot allocator)
        So it should now be safe to increase --maximumTmpsForGraphColoring.

        It is valuable to increase it, because some webpages such as https://dos.zone/en/play/https%3A%2F%2Fdoszone-uploads.s3.dualstack.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Foriginal%2F2X%2Fb%2Fb4b5275904d86a4ab8a20917b2b7e34f0df47bf7.jsdos see massive performance wins/losses depending on whether we register allocate all of their wasm functions or not.
        For example that page has two functions with ~54k temporaries, and its integrated benchmark has a score increase from about 27 to about 70 on an M1 MBP 2020 when they are register allocated.
        External reports suggest that this the performance difference is even larger on older machines (5.5 to 48).

        [RISCV64] Add assembly, disassembly infrastructure
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232870

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Provide the necessary facilities for assembling and disassembling
        RISC-V instructions. This is just a preliminary patch that introduces
        the necessary assembly and disassembly infrastructure while actual
        enhancements to RISCV64Assembler and MacroAssemblerRISCV64 classes are
        left for later.

        In RISCV64Assembler.h header, necessary helper functions, enumerations
        and structs are introduced that enable crafting instruction values in
        accordance with the base RISC-V specification. All the necessary
        immediate and instruction types are supported, and the relevant
        instruction definitions are introduced and become usable in future work.

        For debugging purposes, a custom RISC-V disassembler is also introduced
        and is enabled when appropriate. The implementation utilizes
        functionality introduced in RISCV64Assembler.h, and different formatters
        are introduced to handle special cases even among the established
        instruction types.

        Refactoring and PutByVal cleanup
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232265

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Follow-up from https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232242,
        this patch includes several small code changes but the patch doesn't
        add/remove any feature:

        1. Removed several calls to operationPutByVal*Cell* that were
        only used by the 32 bit code paths due to the lack of registers.
        These calls were replaced by the calls used by the 64 bit paths,
        that expect EncodedJSValues
        2. Because of #1, this patch removes those methods, since no one
        uses them anymore.
        3. Created compilePutByVal to handle all cases (similar to compileGetByVal).
        4. Removed the Edge& childX from the PutByVal handling (and all methods
        that expected them) in favor of getting them from node when needed.
        5. Unified compileContiguousPutByVal so it could be used by both 32
        and 64 bit archs.
        6. Removed a lot of whitespace.

        When inlining NewSymbol in the DFG don't universally call ToString on the input
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232754

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        When inlining Symbol(x) in the DFG, we were always calling ToString on x.
        However, this is wrong spec wise. If x is undefined, the symbol should
        produce a description value of `undefined`, but calling ToString on x was causing
        us to produce a description with the string `"undefined"`.

        [JSC] Implement IntlNumberFormat v3
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215438

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        This patch implements part of Intl.NumberFormat v3 proposal[1].
        It adds (1) several new options to Intl.NumberFormat, (2) adds
        formatRange and formatRangeToParts to Intl.NumberFormat and Intl.PluralRules,
        and (3) adds toIntlMathematicalValue support, which allows some of Intl.NumberFormat
        functions to take "string" decimal form.

        We cannot implement some features because it requires super new ICU.

            - trailingZeroDisplay (requires ICU 69)
            - halfCeil / halfFloor (requires ICU 69)
            - signDisplay: "negative" (requires ICU 69)
            - formatRangeToParts (requires ICU 70)

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch ports the x86_64 fast path for OpMod from baseline JIT to LLInt.

        This is quite similar to OpDiv but the implementation avoids using binaryOpCustomStore
        because OpMod is not a ProfiledBinaryOp.

        Performance results appear negligible with all JIT tiers enabled;
        relevant microbenchmarks with JIT off are as follows.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        In offlineasm, `OP a, b, c` is `c = a OP b` but `OP a, b` is `b = b OP a`.

        This can make identifiers like `left` and `right` quite confusing --
        simple cases like `subd left, right` are already misleading, while OpDiv literally
        passes its RHS to a macro as `left` and then checks `left` for division by zero.
        It becomes difficult to keep this all in one's brain without rewriting it on paper.

        This patch may not constitute a "complete solution", but it at least makes our naming honest:
        1. Use 3-argument syntax (as `left, right, result`) whenever possible.
        2. When not possible (e.g. because `bsubio` isn't flexible about its arguments or
           because x86 doesn't have 3-argument shift operations), then say `rhs, lhs` explicitly.

        rdar://84402043

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        UINT_MAX (and anything above it) is not a valid array index, so we cannot use JSObject::get(JSGlobalObject*, unsigned) with an index that big.
        This was pointed by Yusuke in his review of my recent patch that introduced the problem (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229353#c21),
        but I misunderstood the code and thought we could never get values that big at that point, thus only putting a RELEASE_ASSERT.
        In this patch I instead apply his original suggestion to have a first loop using the (fast) JSObject::get(),
        and a second loop for any large indices, using a slower but safe code path.

        I also fixed an unrelated bug I noticed in Clobberize/AbstractInterpreter while testing the rest of the patch:
        they were not aware that NewTypedArray can take a Int52RepUse child.

        Finally, while trying to properly test this change, I discovered that genericTypedArrayViewProtoFuncSlice
        (which is the only caller of JSGenericTypedArrayView<Adaptor>::set which passes it a non-0 objectOffset)
        was still using unsigned everywhere instead of size_t, and that the same was true of all other functions in the same file.
        So I fixed it in the same patch.

        [JSC] Having StructureStubInfo and CallLinkInfo via FixedVector for Baseline JIT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232521

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We know # of StructureStubInfo and # of CallLinkInfo after compiling Baseline JIT code.
        So when installing a code into CodeBlock, we do not need to use Bag<>. Instead we can just
        use FixedVector to allocate these instances.

        We keep FixedVector<StructureStubInfo> and FixedVector<CallLinkInfo> in JITData for Baseline JIT.
        And moving Bag<StructureStubInfo> and Bag<CallLinkInfo> to DFG::CommonData when they are instantiated
        for DFG / FTL codes.

        [JSC] Clean up Baseline StructureStubInfo management
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232513

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        1. We should keep Generator::m_stubInfo nullptr. And we add some assertions about it since it should not
           be allocated and used.
        2. We found that propertyIsInt32 for op_get_by_val and op_put_by_val is not appropriately configured for
           UnlinkedStructureStubInfo (it was accidentally set for the above wasted StructureStubInfo). This patch
           attaches that information.
        3. We keep UnlinkedStructureStubInfo in a FixedVector in BaselineJITCode. While we need to keep pointer
           identity while compiling Baseline JIT, after that, we no longer need to keep that since these pointers
           are not embedded into JIT code. This patch allocates UnlinkedStructureStubInfo via SegmentedVector during
           compilation to keep pointer identity, but when finalizing, we allocate FixedVector and copy the above content
           to that to keep memory as small as possible. We should do similar thing to UnlinkedCallLinkInfo, StructureStubInfo etc.
           for baseline, but this should be done in a separate patch.

        Since now we can have null references I've also updated call_ref implementation to check the target reference for null.
        According to the spec (https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/blob/master/proposals/function-references/Overview.md#functions)
        we must trap on null.

        [JSC][32bit] Fix CSR restore on DFG tail calls, add extra register on ARMv7
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230622

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This re-introduces the patch reverted by
        https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/284911/webkit
        with the C_LOOP interpreter now fixed.

        The only difference between the original patch and this version is in
        LowLevelInterpreter32_64.asm and LowLevelInterpreter64.asm, which
        need the PC base (PB) register restored on C_LOOP on return from a
        call, as C_LOOP does not seem to handle this as a proper callee save
        register (CSR). On non C_LOOP builds, the CSR restore mechanism takes
        care of this, so removed the superfluous instructions.

        --- Original ChangeLog ---

        This patch does two things:

        1. Adds an extra callee save register (CSR) to be available to DFG on
        ARMv7. To do this properly required the following:

        architectures that is required to restore CSRs properly after a tail

        [JSC] Improve offlineasm debug annotations for Linux/ELF
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232303

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch does two things:

        Add the .size and .type directives to every llint "function"
        (global, llint opcode, 'glue'). This allows a debugger to tell you
        in what logical function you are inside the giant chunk of code
        that is the llint interpreter. So instead of something like this:

        (gdb) x/5i $pc
          => 0xf5f8af60 <wasmLLIntPCRangeStart+3856>:  b.n     0xf5f8af6c <wasmLLIntPCRangeStart+3868>
             0xf5f8af62 <wasmLLIntPCRangeStart+3858>:  ldr     r2, [r7, #8]
             0xf5f8af64 <wasmLLIntPCRangeStart+3860>:  ldr     r2, [r2, #28]
             0xf5f8af66 <wasmLLIntPCRangeStart+3862>:  subs    r0, #16
             0xf5f8af68 <wasmLLIntPCRangeStart+3864>:  ldr.w   r0, [r2, r0, lsl #3]

        you get something like this:

        (gdb) x/5i $pc
          => 0xf5f8c770 <wasm_f32_add+12>:      bge.n   0xf5f8c77c <wasm_f32_add+24>
             0xf5f8c772 <wasm_f32_add+14>:      add.w   r6, r7, r9, lsl #3
             0xf5f8c776 <wasm_f32_add+18>:      vldr    d0, [r6]
             0xf5f8c77a <wasm_f32_add+22>:      b.n     0xf5f8c78c <wasm_f32_add+40>
             0xf5f8c77c <wasm_f32_add+24>:      ldr     r2, [r7, #8]

        The other change adds a local symbol (in addition to an internal
        label) to all the "glue" labels. That allows wasm opcodes to be
        seen by the debugger (and the user to break on them), among other
        things.

        * CMakeLists.txt: tell offlineasm we use the ELF binary format on Linux.
        * llint/LowLevelInterpreter.cpp: emit a non-local label for "glue" labels.
        * offlineasm/asm.rb: emit the .size and .type directives for every
        llint "function" on ELF systems.

        [JSC][32bit] Use DataIC in Baseline JIT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232079

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch ports the JSVALUE32_64 baseline JIT to use DataICs.

        The majority of the involved opcodes (all but one) could be easily
        modified to use a common implementation between JSVALUE64 and
        JSVALUE32_64 platforms by abstracting over machine registers holding a
        JSValue using JSValueReg types instead of GPRReg.

        The only non-trivial additional abstraction needed was over the ideal
        argument registers used in a function call, so loading the arguments
        from memory can put them straight in the ABI specific argument
        register whenever possible, or appropriate temporaries otherwise. For
        this I added CCallHelpers::preferredArgumentGPR (for passing host
        pointers and other primitive types that fit in a machine register on
        the host platform), and CCallHelpers::preferredArgumentJSR (for
        passing JSValue/EncodedJSValue). Please see the description of these
        in the code.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        In case NewTarget has a cross-realm "prototype" object, even though the instance
        structure is created with correct [[Prototype]], it's m_globalObject is of NewTarget's
        realm instead of prototype's.

        That is observable in various places, including when calling CustomAccessor, fast paths
        for iteration protocol / collection constructors, isHavingABadTime() handling etc.

        This patch fixes structure's global object to be correct: per spec [1], we fallback to

        Heap::vm() already computes the associated VM& using offset math.  This entails
        subtracting a constant from Heap's this pointer, which is faster than loading from

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        objectPrototypeIsSane, arrayPrototypeChainIsSane, and stringPrototypeChainIsSane reloads structures from prototype objects while the caller
        is already getting them and validating them. This introduces a race condition where structure transition happens just before calling these
        APIs and we will see different structures which are already validated. This is simply wrong: if we validate one structure, then we should
        continue using that and we should put a watchpoint on this structure. We should not reload structures from the prototype again.

        We add Concurrently postfix to these functions, and passing structures to these APIs to continue using these structures instead of reloading
        it from prototype objects. This eliminate the race condition we had, and this removes the necessity of load-load-fence on watchpoint state
        retrieval.

        shadow realms implementation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230602

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Implementation of the Shadow Realms proposal (stage 3 in TC39) [1]

        Main APIs added are
         - `new ShadowRealm()`
           creates an object that has its own global object and module graph.
         - ShadowRealm.prototype.evaluate(sourceText)
           this allows for evaluating code in the context of the realm, which
           has its own module graph and global object.
         - ShadowRealm.prototype.importValue(specifier, exportName)
           this allows importing module exports in the the context of the
           realm, which has its own module graph and global object.

        The main detail of the Shadow Realm implementation is that values
        passed between realms must be either primitives or wrapped callables.
        Wrapped callables themselves are callables that check that their
        arguments and return values are also either primitives or wrapped
        callables. This detail is implemented via JS builtins + a few new
        intrinsics.

        Can be enabled using `--useShadowRealm=true`

           times when there appears to be "multiple" codeOrigins for any given instruction
           is if the instruction before it was elided, thereby leaving the elided
           instruction's codeOrigin to be mis-attributed to the subsequent instruction.

        4. Moved the MIPS `Assembler.putStr` method to asm.rb.  This method was already
           commonly used in arm.rb and arm64.rb previously.  Hence, it belongs in common
           code.

           Also enhanced it to support indenting by the column width of ".loc" debug
           annotations if `$enableDebugAnnotations` is true.  This keeps the ".loc" column
           on the left clear of other content, thereby making it easy to visually filter
           out that column when scanning through the generated asm code.

        5. Changed some code that called `outp.puts` directly to call `$asm.putStr` instead.
           This yields the nice alignment for easy visual filtering described in (4). 

        6. Changed `$preferredCommentStartColumn` to be at column 40 to make the generated
           asm code more compact.  However, if the backend is the C_LOOP, then change it
           back to 60 because C_LOOP code is more verbose and need the extra space.

        [JSC] Use SourceID in SamplingProfiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231855

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        SamplingProfiler was still using intptr_t. We replace it with SourceID.
        We also define internalSourceID and aggregatedExternalSourceID in SourceID.h.
        They are special SourceID internally used in SamplingProfiler.

        Allow WASM to use up to 4GB
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229353
        rdar://81603447

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        While increasing MAX_ARRAY_BUFFER_SIZE to 4GB was easy, it was not remotely the only thing required to get this to work:
        - 4GB is not representable in a uint32_t, so I changed all length of ArrayBuffer/TypedArray/etc.. to being size_t.
        - This also required changing NewTypedArray in all of LLInt/Baseline/DFG/FTL to accept a non-int32 size.
            In order to avoid performance regressions, I had to add speculation in the DFG/FTL, which now have two versions of NewTypedArray (one that takes an Int32 and one that takes a StrictInt52)
        - Similarly, GetArrayLength and GetTypedArrayByteOffset now can either return an Int32 or a larger number.
            I also had to split them in the DFG/FTL, see GetTypedArrayLengthAsInt52 and GetTypedArrayByteOffsetAsInt52 for examples
        - In turns, I had to add CheckInBoundsInt52 since CheckInBounds could not accept the result of GetTypedArrayLengthAsInt52
        - I modified the runtime functions for GetByVal/PutByVal/DataViewGet/DataViewSet/AtomicsXXX to accept non-Int32 indices, since for {Int8/UInt8/UInt8Clamped}Array, a maximum size of 4GB implies indices > 2B.
        - I added a "mayBeLargeTypedArray" bit to ArrayProfile/UnlinkedArrayProfile/DFG::ArrayMode to track whether such a non-Int32 index was seen to allow proper speculation and specialization of fast paths in the DFG/FTL.
            I then updated the runtime functions used by the slow paths to correctly update it.

        Unfortunately I ran out of time to add all the speculations/update all the fast paths.
        So the following will have to wait for a follow-up patch:
        - Accepting large indices in the fast path of GetByVal in the LLInt
        - Accepting large indices in the fast paths generated by AccessCase/PolymorphicAccess
        - Accepting large indices in the fast paths generated by the DFG/FTL for each of GetByVal/PutByVal/DataViewGet/DataViewSet/AtomicsXXX

        The current patch is functional, it will just have dreadful performance if trying to use indices >2B in a {Int8/UInt8/UInt8Clamped}Array.

        Other minor changes in this patch:
        - Fixed an undefined behavior in ArrayBuffer::createInternal where memcpy could be called on nullptr (the spec explicitly bans this even when length is 0)
        - Replaced some repetitive and error-prone bounds checking by calls to WTF::isSumSmallerThanOrEqual, which is clearer, shorter, and reuse CheckedArithmetic facilities to avoid overflow issues.
        - Fixed a variety of obsolete comments
        - Added support for branch64(RelationalCondition cond, RegisterID left, Imm64 right)
            (there was already support for the same but with TrustedImm64)
        - Made various AbstractMacroAssembler function constexpr as part of the previous point

        [JSC] Optimize Structure::getConcurrently
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231825

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        From artrace data, we found that Structure::getConcurrently is taking fair amount of time
        in Speedometer2 *in the main thread*! This is because Structure::getConcurrently is used
        in PropertyCondition, and its validation can be called in the main thread when watched
        Structure transition happens, ObjectPropertyConditionSet is created for IC etc.

        Structure::getConcurrently is slow since it is using Structure::forEachPropertyConcurrently.
        We can optimize Structure::getConcurrently since,

            1. We do not need to track seen properties via seenProperties HashSet.
            2. We can handle TransitionKind::PropertyDeletion.
            3. We can use PropertyTable::get.

        We are seeing consistent 0.4% improvement in Speedometer2 (I ran 120 Speedometer2 runs twice and both said 0.4% improvement).

        [JSC][32bit] Fix CSR restore on DFG tail calls, add extra register on ARMv7
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230622

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch does two things:

        1. Adds an extra callee save register (CSR) to be available to DFG on
        ARMv7. To do this properly required the following:

        2. Implements the necessary shuffling in CallFrameShuffler on 32-bit
        architectures that is required to restore CSRs properly after a tail
        call on these architectures. This also fixes the remaining failures in
        the 32-bit build of the unlinked baseline JIT.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        While increasing MAX_ARRAY_BUFFER_SIZE to 4GB was easy, it was not remotely the only thing required to get this to work:
        - 4GB is not representable in a uint32_t, so I changed all length of ArrayBuffer/TypedArray/etc.. to being size_t.
        - This also required changing NewTypedArray in all of LLInt/Baseline/DFG/FTL to accept a non-int32 size.
            In order to avoid performance regressions, I had to add speculation in the DFG/FTL, which now have two versions of NewTypedArray (one that takes an Int32 and one that takes a StrictInt52)
        - Similarly, GetArrayLength and GetTypedArrayByteOffset now can either return an Int32 or a larger number.
            I also had to split them in the DFG/FTL, see GetTypedArrayLengthAsInt52 and GetTypedArrayByteOffsetAsInt52 for examples
        - In turns, I had to add CheckInBoundsInt52 since CheckInBounds could not accept the result of GetTypedArrayLengthAsInt52
        - I modified the runtime functions for GetByVal/PutByVal/DataViewGet/DataViewSet/AtomicsXXX to accept non-Int32 indices, since for {Int8/UInt8/UInt8Clamped}Array, a maximum size of 4GB implies indices > 2B.
        - I added a "mayBeLargeTypedArray" bit to ArrayProfile/UnlinkedArrayProfile/DFG::ArrayMode to track whether such a non-Int32 index was seen to allow proper speculation and specialization of fast paths in the DFG/FTL.
            I then updated the runtime functions used by the slow paths to correctly update it.

        Unfortunately I ran out of time to add all the speculations/update all the fast paths.
        So the following will have to wait for a follow-up patch:
        - Accepting large indices in the fast path of GetByVal in the LLInt
        - Accepting large indices in the fast paths generated by AccessCase/PolymorphicAccess
        - Accepting large indices in the fast paths generated by the DFG/FTL for each of GetByVal/PutByVal/DataViewGet/DataViewSet/AtomicsXXX

        The current patch is functional, it will just have dreadful performance if trying to use indices >2B in a {Int8/UInt8/UInt8Clamped}Array.

        Other minor changes in this patch:
        - Fixed an undefined behavior in ArrayBuffer::createInternal where memcpy could be called on nullptr (the spec explicitly bans this even when length is 0)
        - Replaced some repetitive and error-prone bounds checking by calls to WTF::isSumSmallerThanOrEqual, which is clearer, shorter, and reuse CheckedArithmetic facilities to avoid overflow issues.
        - Fixed a variety of obsolete comments
        - Added support for branch64(RelationalCondition cond, RegisterID left, Imm64 right)
            (there was already support for the same but with TrustedImm64)
        - Made various AbstractMacroAssembler function constexpr as part of the previous point

        After r283852, the unwinder can now ask WebAssembly frames for their bytecodeIndex.
        We do write to the bytecodeIndex when throwing from the wasm `throw` opcode, but we
        failed to write when trapping (e.g.  throwing an OOB or Unreachable). The value of
        the bytecodeIndex in this is case is not interesting, since these exceptions can't be
        caught from Wasm, all we need to know is ensure there isn't an invalid left-over
        value in that stack slot, so we zero it.

        shadow realms implementation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230602

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Implementation of the Shadow Realms proposal (stage 3 in TC39) [1]

        Main APIs added are
         - `new ShadowRealm()`
           creates an object that has its own global object and module graph.
         - ShadowRealm.prototype.evaluate(sourceText)
           this allows for evaluating code in the context of the realm, which
           has its own module graph and global object.
         - ShadowRealm.prototype.importValue(specifier, exportName)
           this allows importing module exports in the the context of the
           realm, which has its own module graph and global object.

        The main detail of the Shadow Realm implementation is that values
        passed between realms must be either primitives or wrapped callables.
        Wrapped callables themselves are callables that check that their
        arguments and return values are also either primitives or wrapped
        callables. This detail is implemented via JS builtins + a few new
        intrinsics.

        Can be enabled using `--useShadowRealm=true`

        [JSC][32bit] Fix wrong branchAdd32 assembly for ARMv7
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231362

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        After the unlinked baseline jit was merged, a new branchAdd32 method
        needed to be implemented for ARMv7, however, the first version
        submitted by me used the add32 method to perform the add before
        branching.

        In this patch, we fix the call to add32 by adding a new private method
        add32Impl with an optional parameter that selects either add or adds,
        make branchAdd32 call the adds version.

        Invoke build scripts with python3 explicitly

        Reviewed by Jonathan Bedard.

        Much of the work to support Python 3 was done years ago, but we need this to
        actually use Python 3 on macOS.

        Python 3 no longer raises ValueError on relative module import failure, so changed
        that to the correct ImportError.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        My original fix in r283512 has some theoretical spec correctness issues.
        I'm not sure if they can be materialized or not since we only use
        get_by_id_with_this in very limited scenarios. However, this patch just
        makes it so we call the getter instead of attempting to inline it
        when using get_by_id_with_this.

        Remove ImplicitAddress
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230820
        <rdar://problem/83826318>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Because we rely on implicit conversion from RegisterID to int values,
        some compilers (aka MSVC) might convert a constant RegisterID that's passed in
        to nullptr instead of calling the implicit constructor in ImplicitAddress.
        
        For example, I got bit by this when I had code that did:
        loadPtr(regT0, xyz)
        
        This called the loadPtr(void*, RegisterID) function with nullptr passed as
        the first argument instead of the loadPtr(ImplicitAddress, RegisterID)
        function.
        
        Let's avoid any such problems in the future by just not using ImplicitAddress.

        We had the same code to allocate a scratch register allocator copy pasted
        all over the IC code. This patch refactors that to use a shared helper.
        
        Also, Delete was using a ScratchRegisterAllocator for no reason (it never
        allocated a scratch register), so I deleted that code.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Since the new unlinked baseline JIT was introduced, the baseline JIT
        uses the metadata table GPR the same way as the LLInt does, and relies
        on it being in a saved CSR in emit_op_catch. This unearthed an issue
        in the order in which LLInt on ARMv7 stores and restores CSRs when
        trying to handle exceptions. This patch fixes the mismatch.

        This patch gives SourceID a proper type name and shrinks it to
        32-bits on 64-bit systems. Shrinking the size makes room on
        SourceProvider for metadata in a future patch I'm working on.
        It's also pretty unlikely that any system has more than ~4 billion
        script tags, evals, wasm modules so shinking the size is unlikely
        to cause any debugger/profiling issues.

        When I ported the phase to run right after bytecode parsing, I wanted
        to maintain the same behavior as the prior pass that ran after CPS
        rethreading. I noticed a slight bug in some of my logic that changed
        some of heuristics and how they'd effect double voting.
        
        The old patch was mimicking the "is loaded from" bit by using the NodeFlags.
        Howver, this has some issues with how this interacts with our other uses
        of NodeFlags. So, to make things simple, I just add a new "VariableIsUsed"
        bit.

        Implement the WebAssembly exception handling proposal
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229681
        <rdar://81603387>

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Add support for the WebAssembly exception handling proposal, as per
        the WIP spec: https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling

        The proposal includes 6 new instructions: try, catch, catch_all,
        delegate, throw and rethrow. All the instructions are supported by
        the LLInt and B3 generators, but not yet supported in Air. Any
        functions use exceptions will use B3 in BBQ.

        A few important notes about the implementation:
        - In B3, since we can now have multiple entrypoints (one for the
        function entry + 1 for each catch/catch_all), we can no longer just
        replace every value in the stack with a Phi when we find a new
        entrypoint. This worked so far because of the assumption that any
        block couldn't access its enclosing stack, and since the enclosing stack
        would only be accessible when we exited the current block, we added Phis
        at the end of each block when we had a new entrypoint. Now, since we have to capture all
        live values at any point that might throw (calls, throw and rethrow),
        we break that assumption. To simplify all the possible ways we might
        have to merge the state from multiple entrypoints we now use B3
        Variables to represent stack slots.
        - Some extra information is required to be able to properly restore
        the state when catching an exception:
            - We added a field VM::calleeForWasmCatch. This field is necessary
            because whenever we throw, we might end up in JavaScript, which
            assumes the callee is a cell and uses it to get the VM and restore
            callee saves. The issue is when catching exceptions in wasm we
            still need the original callee, and if throwing and catching from
            the same frame, that call frame slot has now been overwritten, so
            we store its original value in the VM field.
            - We also need to store the current Wasm Instance into the call
            frame's slot for the `this` argument. The instance is used both by
            the unwinder, to check if the exception being thrown matches the
            exceptions handled by catch candidates, and by the catch implementation,
            which is necessary when throwing from a cross instance call where both
            the callee save or TLS will have the callee's instance.
            - We store the current opcode for the llint, or the
            call site index for B3, in the call frame slot for the argument
            count tag. The call site index is used by the unwinder to check
            if a given catch can handle the exception being thrown.

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        We've found yet another bug where pruning code after OSR exits
        before running backwards propagation leads to us breaking the spec
        in weird IR situations. In the particular test case here, we end
        up not thinking we care about negative zero for an ArithNegate,
        and we exit the program while recovering the value 0 instead of -0.
        
        Fundamentally, backwards propagation wants to see all bytecode uses.
        Therefore, it seems like a more sound strategy to run backwards propagation
        before we end up mucking with the graph. This patch makes it so we run
        backwards propagation inside bytecode parser before we prune the IR.
        That way, the phase sees the graph as if it's an IR over the whole bytecode
        graph.

        [JSC] JSPropertyNameEnumerator should not have cached prototype chain since empty JSPropertyNameEnumerator is shared
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231202
        rdar://83815122

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        r282014 assumed an invariant that JSPropertyNameEnumerator's StructureChain is immutable.
        This invariant is also used in validation of JSPropertyNameEnumerator. However, this
        invariant was broken since we now have shared empty sentinel JSPropertyNameEnumerator, which can
        be used for different structures having different prototype chain.

        Since now we have shared JSPropertyNameEnumerator, JSPropertyNameEnumerator should not have
        StructureChain in its member. When invalidating StructureChain in Structure, we also clear
        cached JSPropertyNameEnumerator so that we do not get a stale JSPropertyNameEnumerator from
        Structure even though watchpoint-based validation is not used.

        This patch also removes ValidatedViaWatchpoint flag in JSPropertyNameEnumerator due to the same
        reason. We should not modify JSPropertyNameEnumerator once it is instantiated. Instead, we encode
        this flag as a lowest bit of m_cachedPropertyNameEnumerator. If it is validated via traversing (not watchpoints),
        then this bit is set. So when loading that pointer from StructureRareData, we can quickly detect
        it without even accessing to the enumerator. This fixes the issue, and it is even cleaner.
        We rename m_cachedPropertyNameEnumerator to m_cachedPropertyNameEnumeratorAndFlag since it now
        includes this flag.

        While reviewing the code, we also found that watchpoint-based validation didn't care about PolyProto.
        We should disable watchpoint-based validation if PolyProto is used.

        this. This patch makes the __proto__ intrinsic getter do the right
        thing. For typed array intrinsic getters, if they have different
        |this| value vs slot base, we chose not to inline them, because
        the type checks are not on the |this| value, so they're not guaranteed
        to be typed arrays. We can improve upon this in the future.

        Consider the following:
        - We have a CodeBlock A.
        - DFG or FTL compiles an exit to A when A is still LLInt code. This means
          the OSR exit code will materialize registers as if A is LLInt.
        - We tier up A to Baseline JIT code.
        - Now, we take the exit to A as if it's LLInt. But the checkpoint OSR exit
          code will actually jump to the tiered up baseline code when it's done,
          because it determines where to jump at runtime. Because of this, when
          we return from the checkpoint code, and if we are jumping into baseline
          code, we must always load the constant pool register.
        - There's no need to load the metadata register because that register is
          shared with LLInt code, and will already contain the right value.

        The phase was searching backwards in the graph to see if it found the RegExp
        node. However, the RegExp node might be a JSConstant. Hence, the program
        didn't allocate it. So we can't assume that we know what the lastIndex is.
        We were incorrectly assuming it was "0" in a program like this:
        a: JSConstant(RegExp)
        b: RegExpExec(@a)
        
        And we assumed we're invoking RegExpExec with lastIndex is 0, because we found
        our RegExp in a backwards search. This is likely because we're also matching
        NewRegExp nodes, in which case, it is valid to say lastIndex is 0.
        
        This caused us to return a constant value that would've been the exec
        result had we invoked it with a NewRegExpNode.

        Make byte codes with arithmetic profiles switch to using an index instead of a pointer in metadata
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230798

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch makes each bytecode that uses a BinaryArithProfile/UnaryArithProfile
        have an index into a table instead of storing a pointer to the profile in its metadata.
        Then, we can just load the profile using the index in the bytecode, which saves memory.

        Speed up setting JSFunction's "prototype" property

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch:

          1. Removes "prototype" lookup from put(), which was non-inlineable and created an
             interim object with "constructor" field. Instead, the new value is put directly,
             with correct attributes, and respecting an altered receiver. This results in 2.8X
             perf boost for very common case of setting "prototype": `Cat.prototype = new Animal`.

          2. Simplifies initialization of class constructor's prototype object, removing tentacles
             from getOwnPropertySlot() and extracting constructPrototypeObject() helper. Provides
             a fast path for op_define_data_property, speeding up `class` creation by ~40%, while
             reifies normal function's prototype with correct attributes for Object.defineProperty().

        This patch adds ApproximateTime, which offers monotonically increasing time but with coarse-grained resolution.
        ApproximateTime::now() is faster than normal MonotonicTime::now(), so that we can use this when we do not care
        about high resolution. For example, in Darwin x64, it is ~4x faster.
        Internally, it is using mach_approximate_time() in Darwin, clock_gettime+CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE in Linux, and
        clock_gettime+CLOCK_MONOTONIC_FAST in FreeBSD. On the other platforms, we simply use the same source to MonotonicTime.

            monotonic-time-now         88.8518+-2.4106

        We would like to use it in some places in JavaScriptCore in a subsequent patch: CodeBlock's creation time, GC time etc.

        Build an unlinked baseline JIT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229223
        <rdar://problem/82321772>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds an "unlinked" baseline JIT to JSVALUE64 platforms. The JIT
        code produced by this baseline JIT can be shared between all CodeBlocks that
        share an UnlinkedCodeBlock. The benefit of this is, if we're creating a CodeBlock
        from an UnlinkedCodeBlock that already compiled an unlinked baseline JIT
        instance, this new CodeBlock just starts off executing in the baseline JIT
        "for free".
        
        To make this work, the code we emit now needs to be independent of a specific
        CodeBlock instance. We use a CodeBlock instance for minimal profiling information
        when compiling, but otherwise, the code is tied to the UnlinkedCodeBlock. When
        we need CodeBlock specific information, we load it. This usually means things
        like we'll load things from the Metadata dynamically. This patch also adds a
        "linked constant pool" concept, and anytime we instantiate such a CodeBlock,
        we also need to instantiate this "linked constant pool". This contains things
        like our inline cache data structures (StructureStubInfo*), JSGlobalObject*,
        etc.
        
        Unlinked baseline JIT always runs ICs in the "data" mode. To make this work, I
        made data ICs work on x86_64. To do this, we no longer call/ret to the IC.
        Instead, we jump to the IC, and the IC jumps back by loading the "done" location
        from the StructureStubInfo dynamically. This simplifies the design to not be
        based on the arm64 calling convention, and keeps the same performance characteristics. 
        
        This patch also adds a new version of InlineAccess that is only used in baseline
        JIT (for now). In the future, we can make the DFG/FTL also use this for Data
        ICs. But we don't need to do that yet since those tiers don't use data ICs by
        default. The baseline JIT now has a pure data IC approach to InlineAccess. So
        instead of repatching code, we repatch fields we load dynamically.
        
        This patch also cleans up a few things in OSR exit, where both DFG/FTL were
        storing callee saves to the callee saves buffer in a weird place, and separate
        from one another. I noticed this code can be simplified if we just store
        callee saves at the end of the OSR exit handler, and from common JIT emission
        code.
        
        This patch also fixes a bug where we could end up with the wrong (and always
        more negative) SP in the baseline JIT. This could happen when we OSR exit
        from an inlined getter/setter. The OSR exit code puts the return PC when
        returning to the call site of the getter/setter to be the inline cache's
        "done location". However, this "done location" didn't used to restore SP.
        This patch conservatively makes it so that we restore the SP at these sites.
        
        This is measured as a 1% speedup on Speedometer2.

        Build an unlinked baseline JIT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229223
        <rdar://problem/82321772>

        This patch adds an "unlinked" baseline JIT to JSVALUE64 platforms. The JIT
        code produced by this baseline JIT can be shared between all CodeBlocks that
        share an UnlinkedCodeBlock. The benefit of this is, if we're creating a CodeBlock
        from an UnlinkedCodeBlock that already compiled an unlinked baseline JIT
        instance, this new CodeBlock just starts off executing in the baseline JIT
        "for free".
        
        To make this work, the code we emit now needs to be independent of a specific
        CodeBlock instance. We use a CodeBlock instance for minimal profiling information
        when compiling, but otherwise, the code is tied to the UnlinkedCodeBlock. When
        we need CodeBlock specific information, we load it. This usually means things
        like we'll load things from the Metadata dynamically. This patch also adds a
        "linked constant pool" concept, and anytime we instantiate such a CodeBlock,
        we also need to instantiate this "linked constant pool". This contains things
        like our inline cache data structures (StructureStubInfo*), JSGlobalObject*,
        etc.
        
        Unlinked baseline JIT always runs ICs in the "data" mode. To make this work, I
        made data ICs work on x86_64. To do this, we no longer call/ret to the IC.
        Instead, we jump to the IC, and the IC jumps back by loading the "done" location
        from the StructureStubInfo dynamically. This simplifies the design to not be
        based on the arm64 calling convention, and keeps the same performance characteristics. 
        
        This patch also adds a new version of InlineAccess that is only used in baseline
        JIT (for now). In the future, we can make the DFG/FTL also use this for Data
        ICs. But we don't need to do that yet since those tiers don't use data ICs by
        default. The baseline JIT now has a pure data IC approach to InlineAccess. So
        instead of repatching code, we repatch fields we load dynamically.
        
        This patch also cleans up a few things in OSR exit, where both DFG/FTL were
        storing callee saves to the callee saves buffer in a weird place, and separate
        from one another. I noticed this code can be simplified if we just store
        callee saves at the end of the OSR exit handler, and from common JIT emission
        code.
        
        This patch also fixes a bug where we could end up with the wrong (and always
        more negative) SP in the baseline JIT. This could happen when we OSR exit
        from an inlined getter/setter. The OSR exit code puts the return PC when
        returning to the call site of the getter/setter to be the inline cache's
        "done location". However, this "done location" didn't used to restore SP.
        This patch conservatively makes it so that we restore the SP at these sites.
        
        This is measured as a 1% speedup on Speedometer2.

        [JSC] Use op_jeq_ptr for empty JSPropertyNameEnumerator check
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230817

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We use op_jeq_ptr for empty JSPropertyNameEnumerator check instead of stricteq for smaller
        bytecode size and efficient branching in LLInt and Baseline. In DFG and FTL, both will get
        the same nodes.

        [JSC] Optimize PutByVal with for-in
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230801

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We found that some of Speedometer2 subtests are heavily using for-in with PutByVal or the other DFG nodes.
        And we also found that we are using polluted non-good type for the property names from for-in: String | Other.
        The reason is that we are returning null when op_enumerator_next finishes instead of string. And this design
        forces DFG and FTL to return null from EnumeratorNextUpdatePropertyName at the end of iteration. This pollutes
        the type of property names as String | Other instead of String, and leading to suboptimal DFG nodes.

        In this patch, we add special sentinel string in vm.smallString.sentinelString(). We know that this string cell
        pointer will be never returned from EnumeratorNextUpdatePropertyName in the normal for-in iteration. This is easy
        since we are always allocating a JSString when creating JSPropertyNameEnumerator. So this string cell (not the content)
        is always different from pre-allocated vm.smallString.sentinelString(). So, we use this special string pointer
        as a sentinel instead of null so that we can avoid polluting return type of EnumeratorNextUpdatePropertyName.

        To check the sentinel in LLInt / Baseline, this patch adds jeq_ptr, which performs cell pointer comparison and do
        not check string content equality. We do not need to have an implementation in DFG since we already have CompareEqPtr
        for existing jneq_ptr bytecode.

        We also clean up DFG operation related to PutByVal.

        [JSC] Optimize PutByVal with for-in
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230801

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We found that some of Speedometer2 subtests are heavily using for-in with PutByVal or the other DFG nodes.
        And we also found that we are using polluted non-good type for the property names from for-in: String | Other.
        The reason is that we are returning null when op_enumerator_next finishes instead of string. And this design
        forces DFG and FTL to return null from EnumeratorNextUpdatePropertyName at the end of iteration. This pollutes
        the type of property names as String | Other instead of String, and leading to suboptimal DFG nodes.

        In this patch, we add special sentinel string in vm.smallString.sentinelString(). We know that this string cell
        pointer will be never returned from EnumeratorNextUpdatePropertyName in the normal for-in iteration. This is easy
        since we are always allocating a JSString when creating JSPropertyNameEnumerator. So this string cell (not the content)
        is always different from pre-allocated vm.smallString.sentinelString(). So, we use this special string pointer
        as a sentinel instead of null so that we can avoid polluting return type of EnumeratorNextUpdatePropertyName.

        To check the sentinel in LLInt / Baseline, this patch adds jeq_ptr, which performs cell pointer comparison and do
        not check string content equality. We do not need to have an implementation in DFG since we already have CompareEqPtr
        for existing jneq_ptr bytecode.

        We also clean up DFG operation related to PutByVal.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch makes each bytecode that uses a BinaryArithProfile/UnaryArithProfile
        have an index into a table instead of storing a pointer to the profile in its metadata.
        Then, we can just load the profile using the index in the bytecode, which saves memory.

        <rdar://problem/82321772>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds an "unlinked" baseline JIT to JSVALUE64 platforms. The JIT
        code produced by this baseline JIT can be shared between all CodeBlocks that
        share an UnlinkedCodeBlock. The benefit of this is, if we're creating a CodeBlock
        from an UnlinkedCodeBlock that already compiled an unlinked baseline JIT
        instance, this new CodeBlock just starts off executing in the baseline JIT
        "for free".
        
        To make this work, the code we emit now needs to be independent of a specific
        CodeBlock instance. We use a CodeBlock instance for minimal profiling information
        when compiling, but otherwise, the code is tied to the UnlinkedCodeBlock. When
        we need CodeBlock specific information, we load it. This usually means things
        like we'll load things from the Metadata dynamically. This patch also adds a
        "linked constant pool" concept, and anytime we instantiate such a CodeBlock,
        we also need to instantiate this "linked constant pool". This contains things
        like our inline cache data structures (StructureStubInfo*), JSGlobalObject*,
        etc.
        
        Unlinked baseline JIT always runs ICs in the "data" mode. To make this work, I
        made data ICs work on x86_64. To do this, we no longer call/ret to the IC.
        Instead, we jump to the IC, and the IC jumps back by loading the "done" location
        from the StructureStubInfo dynamically. This simplifies the design to not be
        based on the arm64 calling convention, and keeps the same performance characteristics. 
        
        This patch also adds a new version of InlineAccess that is only used in baseline
        JIT (for now). In the future, we can make the DFG/FTL also use this for Data
        ICs. But we don't need to do that yet since those tiers don't use data ICs by
        default. The baseline JIT now has a pure data IC approach to InlineAccess. So
        instead of repatching code, we repatch fields we load dynamically.
        
        This patch also cleans up a few things in OSR exit, where both DFG/FTL were
        storing callee saves to the callee saves buffer in a weird place, and separate
        from one another. I noticed this code can be simplified if we just store
        callee saves at the end of the OSR exit handler, and from common JIT emission
        code.
        
        This patch also fixes a bug where we could end up with the wrong (and always
        more negative) SP in the baseline JIT. This could happen when we OSR exit
        from an inlined getter/setter. The OSR exit code puts the return PC when
        returning to the call site of the getter/setter to be the inline cache's
        "done location". However, this "done location" didn't used to restore SP.
        This patch conservatively makes it so that we restore the SP at these sites.
        
        This is measured as a 1% speedup on Speedometer2.

        [JSC] Handle syntactic production for `#x in expr` correctly

        The production for `#x in expr` is easy to get wrong.

                ShiftExpression[?Yield, ?Await]

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        In statements are supposed to throw if they are applied to a non-object. We incorrectly converted
        InByVals into HasIndexedProperty any time they were a cell, so we silently converted non-objects. Before converting
        an InByVal, we first speculate that the base is an object now.

        We do not always require an object edge for HasIndexedProperty because enumerator next() does not
        throw if it encounters a cell that requires conversion during the call to toObject (for example, a
        string literal). That is, we should silently convert the string during enumeration, but not for an
        In statement, and so HasIndexedProperty is prepared to handle both cases.

        In 32 bits the tag of the base was not being preserved before calling

        This patch slightly changes the code to instead of setting the cellTag,
        it now calls the slow path using only the payload if the base is a cell,
        otherwise it uses tag+payload.

        [JSC] Add fast property enumeration mode for JSON.stringify
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230393

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We collected profiles and found several subtests are using JSON.stringify enough. And generated strings are many serialized leaf objects.

        This patch adds fast object property enumeration. When we know that source object meets some conditions, we can say that,
        as long as structure is not changed, we can continue using property names and offset collected from the structure.
        This way removes non observable [[Get]] operations to accelerate JSON.stringify performance for major object iteration cases.

        We also extend MarkedArgumentBuffer: introducing MarkedArgumentBufferWithSize which can take default inline capacity as a template
        parameter. This is used in JSON.stringify to increase the buffer because now we also need to record structures in MarkedArgumentBuffer.

        This offers 0.4% improvement in Speedometer2 (EmberJS-TodoMVC, Vanilla-XXX, EmberJS-Debug-TodoMVC, they have enough amount of JSON.stringify
        time).

        PutByVal and PutPrivateName ICs should emit a write barrier if a butterfly might be allocated

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Right now, PutByVal and PutPrivateName check the value type to determine 
        if a write barrier is needed. For example, putting a primitive is considered 
        to not require a write barrier. This makes sense, except for the case when we 
        might allocate or re-allocate a butterfly in the IC. This does not emit a write 
        barrier, and so the GC might miss the new butterfly. That is somewhat undesirable. 
        This is a temporary conservative fix. If we don't write to the butterfly pointer,
        then we still don't need a write barrier; this work is captured by

        This patch adds UnlinkedValueProfile and UnlinkedArrayProfile to
        UnlinkedCodeBlock. These profiles serialize the data in ValueProfile
        and ArrayProfile. Each time a CodeBlock updates value profiles,
        it mixes in up to date information from the unlinked profiles, and
        also writes back data to the unlinked profiles, so the data is shared
        between CodeBlocks of the same UnlinkedCodeBlock.
        
        This patch also fixes a pre-existing bug where we would sometimes think
        we had more metadata table entries than we really had in practice. This is
        because MetadataTable::forEach used the next opcode's start pointer. That
        pointer was aligned to that opcode's metadata alignment. So that might make
        the previous opcode think it had an extra 1-7 entries (depending on size,
        alignment, etc). This patch fixes that by having the next opcode's start
        offset in the table always be the end offset of the previous opcode, and we
        align the start pointer when using it.

        Fix crash in 32 bits due to not enough scratch registers available
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230241

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Since patch 229229 (Polymorphic PutByVal) landed, jsc is now reaching
        the case Transition in `AccessCase::generateImpl` which needs three
        scratch registers when reallocating, but in ARMv7/MIPS, there are only
        two registers available.

        So in this patch, `AccessCase::createTransition` is changed to actually
        check if there are enough registers available before creating the
        AccessCase object.

        Move some profiling to UnlinkedCodeBlock
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230078
        <rdar://problem/82947571>

        This patch moves ValueProfiles and ArrayProfiles for non-call opcodes into
        UnlinkedCodeBlock. This way, the data is shared between the linked CodeBlocks
        of the same UnlinkedCodeBlock. The profiling bet here is that when the same code
        runs in a different global object, it largely runs in the same way. We've made
        this same bet in other ways with our profiling, and it largely makes sense
        to do for ValueProfile and ArrayProfile since they both hold global object
        independent data.
        
        Because ArrayProfiles are now shared between CodeBlocks, the existing m_usesOriginalArrayStructures
        bit is slightly harder to track now, since the ArrayProfile may see inputs from a different
        global object, an array may be an original array in one lexical global object,
        but not another. So we now track when an ArrayProfile sees a different global
        object than the lexical global object, and when we observe exits in the DFG,
        we propagate that bit to the m_usesOriginalArrayStructures bit.
        
        This patch also makes it so we no longer hold the CodeBlock lock when
        processing ValueProfiles and ArrayProfiles. We now allow multiple compiler
        threads to race against each other when updating these profiles. This is fine.
        It may end up with incomplete data in the profiles, but it won't corrupt them.
        
        This patch also makes it so we finalized visited UnlinkedCodeBlocks to finalize
        their value profiles. We no longer do that work inside CodeBlock for the
        ValueProfiles that UnlinkedCodeBlock owns. This also means that we have to
        WriteBarrier UnlinkedCodeBlock when executing in the LLInt, Baseline, and
        other areas, such as OSR exit, and in the GC when a CodeBlock was executing.
        That way we're guaranteed to visit the UnlinkedCodeBlock, add it to the
        visited set, and then finalize it at the end of GC.
        
        This patch also makes it so that inside CodeBlock::finishCreation, we finish
        linking before we do anything that can throw an exception. It's not valid to
        finalize a CodeBlock that isn't linked.
        
        This was measured as a 0.5-1% speedup on Speedometer2.

        [JSC] Optimize leaf object creation in JSON.parse
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230298

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch optimizes JSON.parse.

        1. Use table in isJSONWhiteSpace.
        2. Extract primitive value creation as parsePrimitiveValue function to use it in different place.
        3. Add leaf-object creation fast path. Previously, when creating a leaf-object from JSON.parse we
           are too generic and jumping around the code. Instead we add a fast path that does not perform
           unnecessary operations and code gets tight.

        It offers 3-4% improvement in microbenchmarks.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230130

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch perfoms a variety of cleanup tasks following the implementation of Temporal.PlainTime.

          1. Do away with the alias Subdurations and refer to ISO8601::Duration directly.
             (But we can still say "subduration" when referring to a single ordered field, as in `largestSubduration`.)
          2. Represent ToTemporalDuration, ToTemporalDurationRecord, and ToLimitedTemporalDuration more directly in code,
             as TemporalDuration::{toTemporalDuration, fromDurationLike, toISO8601Duration}.
             (Note: The last of these doesn't take a disallowedFields parameter;
                    Temporal.Instant can do this after the fact, since no one else makes use of this functionality.)
          3. Extract intlOption<RoundingMode> into a helper function, `temporalRoundingMode`.
          4. Remove largestSubplainTime(), which was declared but not defined.
          5. Correct spelling of TemporalPlainTime::constrainTime().

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230086

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        1. This patch adds fast path of op_get_property_enumerator to LLInt and Baseline. Previously, we only had this fast path in DFG and FTL.
        2. From the profiled data, Speedometer2/React-Redux-TodoMVC has GetPropertyEnumerator(CellOrOther). However, DFG and FTL only optimized
           GetPropertyEnumerator(Cell). We add CellOrOther and Other cases: if the argument is Other, then we can constant fold it to the
           empty enumerator. If the argument is CellOrOther, we can check first, and return empty enumerator for Other case.
        3. This patch also cleans up StructureRareData lookup by introducing StructureType to JSType.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This is a very similar patch to https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226676.
        The difference is that here we allow Strings on both side of the comparison, so we must add code to handle equality among strings.

        Like for that other patch, the optimization is disabled for BigInt32.
        Enabling it in that case would either need modifying the speculation (from banning HeapBigInt to banning all BigInts), or ensuring that we can never have a HeapBigInt so small it compares equal to a BigInt32.

        I only implemented this optimization on 64-bits: it is just painful to write code that handles registers at such a low-level without a 32-bit machine to test things locally.
        If anyone wants to make this optimization work on 32-bit, I don't foretell any major difficulty.

        Finally, like quite a few other useKinds already, this case does not make the CompareStrictEq merge with an adjacent Branch.
        The reason is simply that this patch relies on compileStringEquality, which currently does not support that feature.
        I intend to fix this (for all useKinds at once) in a separate patch.

        Effect on microbenchmarks:
        poly-stricteq-not-double                  46.8000+-0.4110     ^     23.5872+-0.3061        ^ definitely 1.9841x faster
        poly-stricteq-not-double-nor-string       16.6880+-0.2317           16.3627+-0.3729          might be 1.0199x faster

        I looked at how many cases of Untyped/Untyped compareStrictEq have been fixed by this patch and two other recent patches.

        [JSC] Implement Temporal.PlainTime
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229892

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch implements Temporal.PlainTime[1]. This is time representation which is not associated to
        calendars and timezones. This is tuple of hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, and nanosecond.

        1. We add full-fledged ISO8601 DateTime / Time parser, so that Temporal.PlainTime.from can extract
           time as specified.

        2. ISO8601::PlainTime is used for already-validated PlainTime data. When performing arithmetics, we first
           do that in ISO8601::Duration, and then we validate and convert it to PlainTime.

        We also found several spec issues, and reported in [2,3,4].

        [JSC] Implement Temporal.TimeZone

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        This patch implements Temporal.TimeZone. While this patch does not implement features which requires Temporal.Instant,
        we implement the core of Temporal.TimeZone, holding UTC offset or IANA TimeZone ID. This patch implements parsing TimeZoneNumericUTCOffset
        to populate TimeZone from that format.

        Since Temporal.TimeZone is implemented, we also support `Temporal.Now.timeZone()`, which returns current system TimeZone.

        We also fix Intl enumeration not including "UTC". Since it is included in IANA TimeZones, we should include that.

        [JSC] Validate JSPropertyNameEnumerator via watchpoints
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229846

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Looked into Elm-TodoMVC sampling profiler data and found that op_get_property_enumerator is taking enough amount of time.
        And Instruments say validating JSPropertyNameEnumerator via traversing StructureChain is costly.
        We are caching JSPropertyNameEnumerator only when we meet the condition: objects in prototype chain can ensure identity of
        property names if structure is not changed. So we can use watchpoint based approach to invalidate JSPropertyNameEnumerator.

        This patch injects structure transition watchpoints if possible. And when watchpoint is fired, we invalidate JSPropertyNameEnumerator
        cached in StructureRareData, as if we are ensuring prototype chain condition for the other property accesses.

        This offers 0.6% improvement in Speedometer2.

        [JSC] Fix WebKitAdditions directory traversal in offlineasm part 2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229853

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        When DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION is YES, WEBKITADDITIONS_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH is /usr/local/include/WebKitAdditions.
        However, since Xcode implicitly changes it to ${SDKROOT}/usr/local/include/WebKitAdditions, we need to
        pass the path with ${SDKROOT} if this path is used by non-Xcode.

        In this patch, we replace --use-deployment-location with --webkit-additions-path=path and passing WebKitAdditions
        path directly from Xcode. We define WK_WEBKITADDITIONS_INSTALL_PATH and WK_WEBKITADDITIONS_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH in
        JavaScriptCore/Configurations/Base.xcconfig to populate this variable and pass WK_WEBKITADDITIONS_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH
        to the scripts.

        We also fix offlineasm's path concatenation. It was using +, but this does not work if directory doesn't end with '/'.
        We should use File.join when concatenating file paths.

        [JSC] ScriptExecutable::newCodeBlockFor should handle exceptions more predictably
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229787

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        ScriptExecutable::newCodeBlockFor has four codepaths -- one for each of EvalExecutable, ProgramExecutable,
        ModuleProgramExecutable, and FunctionExecutable. These all end up in bool CodeBlock::finishCreation(...),
        but the first three overwrite the current exception with an OOM error while the last does not.
        Furthermore, newCodeBlockFor handles exceptions via an out param, which is then returned by its single caller,
        prepareForExecutionImpl.

        Altogether, this results in some questionable checking of the returned exception against throwScope.exception()
        at prepareForExecution's callsites in Interpreter and elsewhere.

        This patch aims to make this exception handling clearer and more consistent by:
        1. not overwriting an existing exception with an OOM error
        2. doing away with the out param in favor of RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        1. Added a JITOperationValidation.h to tidy up the code for supporting JIT
           operation validation.

        2. Introduce a JITOperationAnnotation struct to record JIT operation function
           pointers, with an extra pointer field for a validation test function.

        3. Changed JSC_ANNOTATE_JIT_OPERATION to capture a JITOperationAnnotation struct
           instead of just a single operation pointer.

        4. Converted the static addPointers() function in JITOperationList.cpp into a
           member function of JITOperationList.  This allows for the code to be more
           terse, as well as enables the use of an inverse map mechanism on debug builds
           only.

        5. Added more macros to help differentiate between different types of JIT
           operation functions.

        6. Made all JIT operation functions use extern "C" linkage to make it possible to
           write validation tests in assembly so that we can run them on a release build
           as well without taking too much time.

        <rdar://problem/82337517>

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Avoid out-of-bounds access into RegisterSet's underlying Bitmap that
        occurs in FTL::saveAllRegisters() and FTL::restoreAllRegisters(). Helper
        Regs::nextRegister() and Regs::nextFPRegister() methods can increase the
        register ID values beyond the valid values, at which point there's a
        possibility of misuse if these register ID values are used to index into
        the Bitmap.

        To avoid this, iterating over RegisterID and FPRegisterID ranges is
        simplified yet kept efficient, and access into the RegisterSet is now
        only done if the register ID values are valid.

        This enables removing Regs::nextFPRegister(). Regs::nextRegister() is
        still used but is not adjusted to also use a for-loop to iterate across
        the valid RegisterID values, and only for those values the access into
        the RegisterSet is possible.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch implements the Duration class for the upcoming Temporal API (currently at stage 3 in TC39).
        Spec: https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#sec-temporal-duration-objects
        Docs: https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html

        A Duration is ultimately an array of doubles (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, ms, μs, ns)
        which can be converted to and from an ISO string representation (e.g. "-P1Y2M3W4DT5H6M7.123456789S")
        and which supports various calculations.

        The spec is still in flux and certain issues were identified in the course of preparing this patch.
        This code aims to be "as correct as possible" for the moment; small corrections are expected in the near future.

        If the base isn't a cell, we're calling the slow path with a random value

        the base is a cell or not, and throw an exception. But we fix this for our

        [JSC] Implement Temporal.Calendar
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229651

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        This patch implements Temporal.Calendar's simple part. Currently, we do not implement many part of Temporal.Calendar since
        we do not have Temporal Date-like structures yet, but this patch implemented core part of Temporal.Calendar: keeping calendar
        identifier.

        We also defer implementing Temporal.Calendar.from's calendar ID parsing part since it requires full-fledged ISO 8601 parser,
        which will be implemented in a separate patch.

        We use `unsigned` for CalendarID, and this id corresponds to the array index of intlAvailableCalendars, which returns array
        of String from ICU.

        RISCV64 support in LLInt
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229035
        <rdar://problem/82120908>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Introduce RISCV64 support at the LLint level. Along with the necessary
        offlineasm backend, plenty of miscellaneous code around MacroAssembler
        infrastructure is also introduced.

        Of the existing supported architectures, RISCV64 is most similar to
        ARM64, with the same word size and similar register abundance. This is
        mirrored in most changes around the MacroAssembler infrastructure as
        well as using same or similar codepaths in LLint for the two ISAs.

        For the MacroAssembler infrastructure, it won't be used until proper JIT
        support is introduced, but the basic facilities are still necessary to
        keep things compiling without complicating the configuration matrix.
        MacroAssemblerRISCV64 class provides no-op methods through C++ templates
        while RISCV64Assembler is also added in a limited form.

        The riscv64 offlineasm backend covers assembly generation for
        instructions that are exhibited by LLInt in the current configuration.
        It doesn't cover instructions that e.g. are only used in the WebAssembly
        opcodes, and WebAssembly won't be enabled until the higher JIT tiers are
        supported anyway.

        The offlineasm backend's assembly generation for specific instructions
        uses pattern matching of operand types for better overview of how
        resulting assembly is constructed. There's still certain improvements
        possible, e.g. in how scratch registers for more expansive operations
        are allocated.

        We were using an unnecessary indirect call to call Probe::executeProbe() when we
        can be using a direct call, which emits less JIT code.  This patch changes the

        Also rename executeProbe to executeJSCJITProbe to make it more unique since we're
        switching to extern "C" linkage for this function now.

        For MacroAssemblerX86Common.cpp, we left the X86 and MSVC implementations unchanged.
        For X86, I don't know the stack alignment requirements (if any) plus we might want
        to delete this code eventually since we're not supporting the X86 JIT anymore.
        For MSVC, I don't know the way to express a direct call in MSVC assembly, and have
        no way to test it.  Will leave that as an exercise for folks working on the Windows
        ports if they are interested.

        [JSC] Polymorphic PutByVal
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229229

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch changes PutByVal IC to modern style. This polymorphic PutByVal can handle multiple array types and multiple identifiers.
        Also, this removes adhoc IC code in Baseline so that it paves the way to unlinked Baseline JIT by cleaning up IC.

        Several interesting points of the design.

        1. We need to pass ArrayProfile* via GPRReg to IC since we need to profile mayStoreToHole, which is still important to avoid the slow path.
        2. Transition / Replace IC need to record propertyRegs if it exists not to clobber these registers. This is important in DFG / FTL since
           IC should not clobber these registers unless it is flushed. It also makes Baseline code smaller since we do not reload them in the slow path call.
        3. Added a path folding String/Symbol when emitting PutByVal in DFG / FTL. This edge-case is found via a microbenchmark. Let's consider the case: one
           put_by_val site has one identifier "foo", but it has so many different Structures. Previously, we emit JITPutByIdGenerator adhocly, and still we
           cache this "foo" identifier in cachedId. In DFG / FTL, while we cannot make it PutByOffset, we can emit PutById since we know that identifier is
           always "foo". But after this patch's change, such a site becomes slow-path. And then this identifier information is missed, and we were emitting
           PutByVal for that. For now, we attempt to fold to one identifier in DFGByteCodeParser so that we can still attempt to make it PutById, which
           can be PutByOffset in constant folding phase. We would like to handle this one identifier slow-path case in PutByStatus / GetByStatus in the future
           patch.
        4. Now, DFG OSR exit does not query to ByValInfo for setter calls since JITPutByValGenerator use StructureStubInfo in Baseline.

        Results of Microbenchmarks look good.

        [ARM64] Fix pre-index address mode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229175

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch fixes the canonicalization phase for pre/post-increment address mode
        due to the potential bugs commented on in the previous patch
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228538. And this patch removed the 
        temporary fix in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229211.

        Previously, the pre-index address mode for Load instruction convert the pattern 
        to the canonical form like this:

            address = Add(base, offset)       address = Add(base, offset)
            ...                          -->  newMemory = Load(base, offset)
            ...                               ...
            memory = Load(base, offset)       memory = Identity(newMemory)

        which is wrong. Assume "..." contains a store to a memory location that aliases for address:

            address = Add(base, offset)       address = Add(base, offset)
            ...                          -->  newMemory = Load(base, offset)
            ...                               ...
            Store(value1, address)            Store(value1, address)
            memory = Load(base, offset)       memory = Identity(newMemory)

        The loaded value should always be value1 which is not true after the conversion.
        So, moving the load above the store is semantically incorrect because it's not identical to
        the behavior of the original program. In this case, maybe we should apply alias analysis to
        detect the violations of reference updating.

        To solve this problem, we moves the address value to just before the memory value instead of
        moving memory value upward.

        Convert Pre-Index Load Pattern to the Canonical Form:

            address = Add(base, offset)                    address = Nop
            ...                                            ...
            ...                                            newAddress = Add(base, offset)
            memory = Load(base, offset)            -->     memory = Load(base, offset)
            ...                                            ...
            parent = B3Opcode(address, ...)                parent = B3Opcode(newAddress, ...)

        Convert Pre-Index Store Pattern to the Canonical Form:

            address = Add(base, offset)                    address = Nop
            ...                                            ...
            ...                                            newAddress = Add(base, offset)
            memory = Store(value1, base, offset)   -->     memory = Store(value1, base, offset)
            ...                                            ...
            parent = B3Opcode(address, ...)                parent = B3Opcode(newAddress, ...)

        To move the address value downward, we need to make sure that no use reference of address between
        the address and memory values.

        [Re-landing] Add some offlineasm enhancements.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229332
        rdar://82163923

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        1. Enhance "include" offlineasm Instruction to always attempt to include an asm
           file from <build-products>/usr/local/include/WebKitAdditions/ first.  If the
           specified file is not available there, then it will attempt to include the file
           from the same directory as the current source file (which in practice, means
           Source/JavaScriptCore/llint/).

        2. Enhance "include" offlineasm Instruction to allow an optional file to be
           included if it exists.  For example, the following offlineasm code:

                include? LowLevelInterpreterAdditions

           ... will attempt to include a file LowLevelInterpreterAdditions.asm.  If the
           file does not exist, this will be a no-op.  Note: the "?" after the "include"
           means the include is optional.

        3. Enhanced "emit" offlineasm Instruction to be able to take more than one operand.

           "emit" used to just copy the string operand that follows into the generated
           LLIntAssembly.h.  Now, "emit" can take multiple comma separated operands, and
           will concatenate all the operands.

           Additionally, "emit" can now take a LocalLabelReference as an operand.  For
           example, this offline asm code:

                   emit "b ", .done
                   ...
                .done:

           ... will generate this inline asm code in LLIntAssembly.h:

                "b " LOCAL_LABEL_STRING(_offlineasm_someLabel_done) "\n"

           This makes it easier to emit branches to local labels.

        4. Also fixed LLInt code alignment for ARM_THUMB2 and ARM64.

           Previously, it was aligned using ".align 4" which means aligned on a 4
           instruction boundary.  Note: the interpretation of .align varies for different
           target CPU architectures.

           Now, we do the alignment using ".balign 4" which means align on a 4 byte
           boundary.  This is the intended alignment because ARM64 instruction size is
           4 bytes, and ARM_THUMB2 instruction size is either 2 bytes or 4 bytes.
           Using .align before was potentially wasting some code space.

        The final instruction in a for-in loop might be the get by val that
        we're rewriting because there was an escape. We won't ever actually
        do peephole optimizations on this get_by_val today, but it breaks
        some bookkeeping that the bytecode generator does. This patch makes

        We were calling flushRegisters() inside code that isn't always runs inside the
        EnumeratorInByVal/EnumeratorHasOwnProperty nodes. That is a violation of how
        flushRegisters() must be used, since flushRegisters() updates global register
        allocation state, and therefore must run each time a node is run. To fix, we
        move flushRegisters() before the code starts emitting branches.

        This patch removes that scratch FPRReg, and removed scratch FPRReg of many arithmetic ICs. This patch is important for PutByVal modern

           specified file is not available there, then it will attempt to include the file
           from the same directory as the current source file (which in practice, means
           Source/JavaScriptCore/llint/).

        2. Enhance "include" offlineasm Instruction to allow an optional file to be
           included if it exists.  For example, the following offlineasm code:

                include? LowLevelInterpreterAdditions

           ... will attempt to include a file LowLevelInterpreterAdditions.asm.  If the
           file does not exist, this will be a no-op.  Note: the "?" after the "include"
           means the include is optional.

        3. Enhanced "emit" offlineasm Instruction to be able to take more than one operand.

           "emit" used to just copy the string operand that follows into the generated
           LLIntAssembly.h.  Now, "emit" can take multiple comma separated operands, and
           will concatenate all the operands.

           Additionally, "emit" can now take a LocalLabelReference as an operand.  For
           example, this offline asm code:

                   emit "b ", .done
                   ...
                .done:

           ... will generate this inline asm code in LLIntAssembly.h:

                "b " LOCAL_LABEL_STRING(_offlineasm_someLabel_done) "\n"

           This makes it easier to emit branches to local labels.

        4. Also fixed LLInt code alignment for ARM_THUMB2 and ARM64.

           Previously, it was aligned using ".align 4" which means aligned on a 4
           instruction boundary.  Note: the interpretation of .align varies for different
           target CPU architectures.

           Now, we do the alignment using ".balign 4" which means align on a 4 byte
           boundary.  This is the intended alignment because ARM64 instruction size is
           4 bytes, and ARM_THUMB2 instruction size is either 2 bytes or 4 bytes.
           Using .align before was potentially wasting some code space.

        Ensure that unused LLInt opcodes are not inadvertently used.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229161

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        The op macro is used for generating LLInt asm code for some entry points to the
        LLInt, where we don't need 16 bits and 32 bit wide versions of the entry point.
        For example, we use it for llint_program_prologue.

        Note that llint_program_prologue is generated using:

            op(llint_program_prologue, macro () ...

        where op is:

            macro op(l, fn)
                commonOp(l, macro () end, macro (size)
                    size(fn, macro() end, macro() end, macro(gen) gen() end)
                    #        ^            ^----- wide32 generator
                    #        `------------------ wide16 generator
                end)
            end

        Note that the generators for the wide16 and wide32 versions of the entry point
        currently emit nothing.  As a result, if we ever have a bug that ends up
        dispatching to llint_program_prologue_wide16 or llint_program_prologue_wide32,
        we'll end up falling thru to llint_module_program_prologue, which just happens
        to be the entry point positioned after those labels.

        This patch adds breakpoints in those 2 unused generators so that we won't
        inadvertently execute code for something else.

        [ARM64] Add Pre/Post-Indexed Address Mode to Air for ARM64 (Store Instruction)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228538

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        The previous patch has introduced the pre/post-index address mode for Load instruction,
        which benefits loop program. Here, this patch adds the corresponding mode for Store
        instruction. Store Register (immediate) stores a word or a doubleword from a register
        to memory. The address that is used for the store is calculated from a base register
        and an immediate offset.

        ######################################
        ## Pre-Index Address Mode For Store ##
        ######################################

        STR Wt, [Xn, #imm]!

        In B3 Reduction Strength, since we have this reduction rule:
            Turns this: Store(value, Add(address, offset1), offset = offset2)
            Into this: Store(value, address, offset = offset1 + offset2)

        The equivalent pattern is:
            address = Add(base, offset)
            ...
            memory = Store(value, base, offset)

        Here, we only consider the pattern:
            address = Add(base, offset)
            memory = Store(value, base, offset)

        And, this patch directly treats it as the canonical form. Ideally, we should move 
        memory to just after the address like what we did for PreIndex Load in the previous 
        patch. But, we cannot provide a better way to do that since the value may be 
        used between address and memory. To move value upward, we must move all descendants 
        of the value along with it to prevent B3 IR index violations, which is risky and expensive.

        Next, lower to Air:
            Move %base, %address
            Move %value, (%address, prefix(offset))

        ## Post-Index Address Mode For Load ##

        Then, the equivalent pattern is:
            memory = Store(value, base, 0)
            ...
            address = Add(base, offset)

        First, we convert it to the canonical form:
            newOffset = Constant
            newAddress = Add(base, offset)
            memory = Store(value, base, 0) // move the offset and address to just before the memory
            ...
            offset = Identity(newOffset)
            address = Identity(newAddress)

        Next, lower to Air:
            Move %base, %newAddress
            Move %value, (%newAddress, postfix(offset))

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228890

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch cleans up and does minor fix to the previous patch (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228047).

        For the modifications in b3/B3Generate.cpp and b3/B3CanonicalizePrePostIncrements.cpp, we
        need to convert post-index candidates to the canonical form. So, the address value needs to
        be moved immediately before the load. This is subject to the dominance constraints that add
        must be controlled equivalent to the load. So, similarly, if we need to move the offset to
        just before the load, the dominance constraints must be satisfied. Since it is a constant
        value, a better approach is to add a new constant value before the memory value. Then,
        eliminate the dead code.

        There is a bug in b3/B3CanonicalizePrePostIncrements.cpp. The insertionSet.execute(BasicBlock)
        will reorder value indexes in the basic block. So, we should re-search for the value index in
        the block every time after the execution.

        In b3/B3LowerToAir.cpp, we need m_locked checks on address and base values. If they are already
        locked, there is no need to convert the Load instruction to the pre/post-increment form.

        Fix ODR violations in JSC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228876

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        When built with LTO enabled, GCC will warn about violations of C++'s one-definition rule.
        JSC currently has two violations. The first is JSC::SpeciesConstructResult, which has two
        different declarations, one in ArrayPrototype.cpp and the other in
        JSArrayBufferPrototype.cpp. I decided to change the version in ArrayPrototype.cpp to make
        the declarations match.

        The next problem is JSC::SignalContext. We have two different versions of this struct, one
        in VMTraps.cpp and the other in SigillCrashAnalyzer.cpp. In this case, I decided to change
        the one in VMTraps.cpp from JSC::SignalContext to JSC::VMTraps::SignalContext.

        for-in should only emit one loop in bytecode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227989

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch redesigns how we implement for-in loops. Before this patch we would emit three copies of the for-in loop body. One for the indexed properties, one for the named-own properties, and one for generic properties (anything else). This had a couple of problems. Firstly, it meant bytecode size grew exponentially to number of nested for-in loops. This in turn meant DFG/FTL compilation took much longer.

        Going off our experience with fast for-of, this patch turns for-in loops specializations into
        a "fused" opcode that internally switches on the enumeration mode it currently sees. For example, if we are enumerating an own-named property, the new enumerator_get_by_val bytecode will check the enumerator cell's cached structure matches the base's then load the property offset directly.

        There are four new opcodes this patch adds, which replace the various operations we had for the specialized loops previously. The new opcodes are EnumeratorGetByVal, EnumeratorInByVal, EnumeratorHasOwnProperty, and EnumeratorNext. The first three correspond to GetByVal, InByVal, and HasOwnProperty respectively. The EnumeratorNext opcode has three results in bytecode, the next enumeration value's mode, the index of the property name, and the property name string itself. When enumeration is done EnumeratorNext returns JS null as the property name string. Since the DFG doesn't support tuples yet this opcode is spilt into four new nodes. The first computes the updated index and mode for the next enumeration key, which is encoded into a single JS number. Then there are two nodes that extract the mode and index. Finally, the last new node produces the property name string or null based on the extracted mode and index.

        Since, in most benchmarks, any given enumeration opcode tends to profile exactly one enumeration mode. This patch focuses primarily on reimplementing all the optimizations we have for any one specific mode. This means there are still potential optimizations for the multi-mode flavors of each new opcode.

        The main optimizations implemented for each new opcode are:

        EnumeratorNext:
        1) IndexedMode loops are loaded and checked for presence inline (DFG/FTL).
        2) NamedMode is computed inline as long as the cached structure on the enumerator cell matches the base (Baseline+). This can only differ if there's a transition.
        3) property names are extracted from the cached buffer inline (Baseline+).

        EnumeratorGetByVal:
        EnumeratorInByVal:
        EnumeratorHasOwnProperty:
        1) IndexedMode has all the optimizations of a normal XByVal on indexed properties (DFG/FTL).
        2) NamedMode will extract the value directly from the inline/out-of-line offset if the structure matches the enumerator's (Baseline+).

        There are also a few interesting changes worth mentioning here:
        1) If a for-in loop would produce an empty enumerator we now always
        return the VMs empty enumerator. This has two benefits, most importantly, it distingishes between an unprofiled for-in loop and empty enumeration, which prevents OSR exit loops. Also, it means that the various Enumerator opcodes no longer need to handle undefined/null when `toObject`ing the base value.

        2) The enumerator now contains a bit set of all the modes it will produce. This removes a few extra branches when speculating on the modes we will see in EnumeratorNext.

        3) In the DFG, enumerator GetByVal relies on compileGetByVal to set the result it also passes a prefix callback which emits code after the various cases set up their operands but before code is emitting to help satisfy the branch over register allocation validation. Also, the array mode branch in compileGetByVal passes the data format that it would prefer, which for normal GetByVal is returned. For EnumeratorGetByVal, that preference is completely ignored and it always returns DataFormatJS.

        [JSC] Yarr's character tracking for BoyerMoore search should be more precise
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228810

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We should track up to 2 candidate characters without masking, so
        that we can search a character without masking. To track candidates,
        we introduce BoyerMooreCharacterCandidates.

        We also add support for m_table because m_table can be used
        for important CharacterClass like `\s`, and still that does not have
        many character candidates if the mode is Char8.

        To make `\s` work on Char8 case, we use Char8 / Char16 information
        to filter characters that never appears in BoyreMoore search bitmap
        construction.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        When I added validation of the dominance of Phis by their Upsilons, I checked two things:
        - There is no path from the entry point to a Phi without going through a corresponding Upsilon (the actual dominance check)
        - There is no way to execute a Phi twice without going through a corresponding Upsilon in between
        The second property is not actually true in B3 IR, I had misunderstood that part of the meaning of Phis/Upsilons.
        So this patch just removes this second check.

        It has no security/stability/performance implication: this is validation code, which runs automatically in debug mode, but should not run at all on customer machines.

        [ARM64] Fix Zoom black screen during video meeting on Safari
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228776

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The problem (rdar://81434487) reports that Zoom turns to a black screen during the video 
        meeting on Safari. The reproduction of this problem is verified and bisected to the previous patch
        (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228057). Previously, we introduce a pattern 
        matching for instruction EON-with-shift on ARM64, where the pattern is d = n ^ ((m ShiftType amount) ^ -1).

            x = m ShiftType amount
            y = x ^ -1
            z = n ^ y

        We check canBeInternal() on x but not on y based on the computing cost analysis in that patch, 
        which is totally wrong. If the pattern matching is triggered, then the compiler would not emit 
        the corresponding Air of x after lowering, leading to data corruption or system crash since y 
        depends on x.

        In the real world example (Zoom video meeting), we find the B3 IR:

            ...
            Int32 b@528 = SShr(b@526, $31(b@527), Wasm: {opcode: I32ShrS, location: 0x26b})
            Int32 b@529 = BitXor(b@528, $-1(b@144), Wasm: {opcode: I32Xor, location: 0x26e})
            ...
            Int32 b@551 = BitXor(b@446, b@529, Wasm: {opcode: I32Xor, location: 0x28e})
            ...


        After Lowering to Air:

            ...
            Not32 %fp, %x2, b@529
            ...
            XorNotRightShift32 %tmp199, %tmp211, $31, %tmp209, b@551
            ...

        Since the implementation of the previous patch does commitInternal() on b@528, the operand of 
        b@529 turns to a frame pointer. To resolve this problem, we should either check canBeInternal() 
        on both b@528 and b@529 or not at all.

        Previously, we pin a register as a temp for materializing a large constant that cannot fit in
        Load/Store imm form. This is not efficient since the register allocator has one less register
        to allocate from. To solve this problem, we should switch to using the link register as the temp
        on ARM64.

        Use loadPair / storePair if possible in YarrJIT. Currently, we are not
        deploying Spooler in YarrJIT, but we should do that in the future too.

        In this patch, we also add appropriate fallback code in loadPair / storePair:
        the offset of these functions are small enough so that we should consider
        overflowing case. If it overflows, we use two loads or stores.

        This patch also adds loadPair32 and storePair32 to all macro assembler so that
        we can call it without CPU(ARM64). Internally, two loads or stores are combined.

        [JSC] Yarr BoyerMoore search should support character-class
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228613

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch adds character-class support for BoyerMoore lookahead search in Yarr.
        Currently, we only support fixed-sized character-class. We can extend it for repeat cases in the future.

        To apply this character-class thing to jQuery's RegExp, we also allow non-fixed-sized disjunction.
        For example, /aaaa.*|bbbb/'s disjunction is not fixed-sized. But still we can use (aaaa|bbbb) prefix since
        this part is fixed-sized and we know minimum-size of this disjunction is 4.

        Plus, instead of giving up BoyerMoore search when we found non-supported terms, we shorten BoyerMoore search
        length not to include this term so that we can still have a chance to leverage BoyerMoore search. In the case
        of /aaaa|bbbb|ccc(d|e|f)/, we previously gave up since it finds `(d|e|f)`. But now, instead we shorten the length
        from 4 to 3, and construct search pattern with `aaa|bbb|ccc`.

        This patch improves jquery-todomvc-regexp by 20%.

        [JSC] Yarr should use Bitmap instead of ByteVector for BoyerMoore search
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228676

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We observed that using Bitmap instead of ByteVector does not pose performance
        issue. It was neutral in jquery-todomvc-regexp.js. In that case, we should use
        Bitmap since it is 8x smaller.

        We also search reusable Bitmap from Vector since comparing 128bit Bitmap is
        super fast so we do not need to bother about linear search here (# of Bitmap
        is currently up to 4).

        To make code simplified, we add regT2 to ARMv7 and MIPS backend of YarrJIT.

        [JSC] branchTest8 should not emit tst for Zero/NonZero cases
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228674

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Previously, branchTest8(NonZero, BaseIndex) emits `tst` instruction
        unnecessarily. This is because the mask is truncated into 8bit, which
        makes branchTest32 (which is internally used in branchTest8) emits tst.
        We observed many unnecessary tst in YarrJIT.

        This patch removes this unnecessary truncation since Zero/NonZero does
        not care high bits of mask in branchTest8. This is ok because the
        ResultCondition version of mask8OnCondition() is always used to generate
        a mask that is only used against a value that is loaded with
        MacroAssemblerHelpers::load8OnCondition(). For Zero/NonZero conditions,
        load8OnCondition() will always zero fill the upper bytes. The 0 filled
        upper bytes will not affect the result of a branch on zero or branch on
        not zero.

        Add Pre/Post-Indexed Address Mode to Air for ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228047

        Reviewed by Phil Pizlo.

        Pre-indexed addressing means that the address is the sum of the value in the 64-bit base register 
        and an offset, and the address is then written back to the base register. And post-indexed 
        addressing means that the address is the value in the 64-bit base register, and the sum of the 
        address and the offset is then written back to the base register. They are relatively common for 
        loops to iterate over an array by increasing/decreasing a pointer into the array at each iteration. 
        With such an addressing mode, the instruction selector can merge the increment and access the array.

        In B3 Reduction Strength, since we have this reduction rule:
            Turn this: Load(Add(address, offset1), offset = offset2)
            Into this: Load(address, offset = offset1 + offset2)

        Then, the equivalent pattern is:
            address = Add(base, offset)
            ...
            memory = Load(base, offset)

        First, we convert it to the canonical form:
            address = Add(base, offset)
            newMemory = Load(base, offset) // move the memory to just after the address
            ...
            memory = Identity(newMemory)

        Next, lower to Air:
            Move %base, %address
            Move (%address, prefix(offset)), %newMemory

            ...
            address = Add(base, offset)

        First, we convert it to the canonical form:
            newOffset = Constant
            newAddress = Add(base, offset)
            memory = Load(base, 0) // move the offset and address to just before the memory
            ...
            offset = Identity(newOffset)
            address = Identity(newAddress)

        Next, lower to Air:

        ## Pattern Match Algorithm ##
        #############################

        To detect the pattern for prefix/postfix increment address is tricky due to the structure in B3 IR. The 
        algorithm used in this patch is to collect the first valid values (add/load), then search for any 
        paired value (load/add) to match all of them. In worst case, the runtime complexity is O(n^2) 
        when n is the number of all values.

        After collecting two sets of candidates, we match the prefix incremental address first since it seems 
        more beneficial to the compiler (shown in the next section). And then, go for the postfix one.

        Stop building WebGPU and the WHLSL compiler to decrease binary size
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228179

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson, Robin Morisset, and Devin Rousso.

        This patch deletes the existing implementation just to reduce binary size in releases of WebKit
        which don't enable WebGPU by default. It doesn't represent a change in direction or policy or
        anything regarding WebGPU. It's a (somewhat temporary) pragmatic change.

        Our current implementation of WebGPU:
        1. Is off by default on all platforms
        2. Is extremely outdated
        3. Has no notion of the GPU Process, and therefore needs to be redesigned and largely rewritten
        4. Only implements a fraction of what is in the spec

        Removing the code from the tree doesn't delete it from existence; it's still in source control.
        The benefit of reducing binary size seems to outweigh having this code in the tree.

        <rdar://80259710>

        Reviewed by Alexey Shvayka.

        definePropertyOnReceiver has a fast path if the slot is not opaque and the receiver doesn't
        have a custom defineOwnProperty implementation, in which case it calls putInlineFast (and
        transitively putDirectInternal<PutModePut>). The issue is that putDirectInternal does not
        handle customValues correctly: it just overwrites the property without changing the attributes.
        To fix that, we should first check if the property might be a custom value, and if that's the case
        we now call `definePropertyOnReceiverSlow`, which has been updated to handle custom values correctly.
        I also added assertions to putInlineFastReplacingStaticPropertyIfNeeded and putDirectInternal
        to make sure we don't accidentally overwrite custom values in the future.

        Reviewed by Tadeu Zagallo.

        This patch implements a part of Legacy RegExp features proposal [1], replacing
        custom values with custom accessors that require |this| value to be RegExp
        constructor of the same realm.

        Apart from fixing property descriptors, this change brings legacy RegExpConstructor
        fields in compliance with invariants of internal methods [2] (described in #151348),
        aligning JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        It doesn't, however, implement [[LegacyFeaturesEnabled]] and RegExp.prototype.compile

        [JSC] Yarr should perform BoyerMoore search
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228301

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch emits skipping fast-path at the beginning of body alternatives with a large stride. So we can quickly discard unrelated characters
        and attempt to find possibly related sequence in the long sequence. The method is derived from V8's implementation (with some extensions).

        If we have a searching pattern /abcdef/, then we can check the 6th character against a set of {a, b, c, d, e, f}.
        If it does not match, we can shift 6 characters. We use this strategy since this way can be extended easily to support
        disjunction, character-class, and ignore-cases. For example, in the case of /(?:abc|def)/, we can check 3rd character
        against {a, b, c, d, e, f} and shift 3 characters if it does not match.

        Then, the best way to perform the above shifting is that finding the longest character sequence which does not have
        many candidates. In the case of /[a-z]aaaaaaa[a-z]/, we can extract "aaaaaaa" sequence and check 8th character against {a}.
        If it does not match, then we can shift 7 characters (length of "aaaaaaa"). This shifting is better than using "[a-z]aaaaaaa[a-z]"
        sequence and {a-z} set since {a-z} set will almost always match.

        We first collect possible characters for each character position. Then, apply heuristics to extract good character sequence from
        that and construct fast searching with long stride.

        ProxyObject callees should be skipped during Function.prototype.caller resolution
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228341

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Just like a bound function, a Proxy with nullish "apply" handler merely forwards
        [[Call]] to its target [1], without pushing onto the execution context stack.
        This fact is also noted in Function.prototype.{caller,arguments} reflection proposal [2].

        This patch aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey if Proxy's "apply" handler is userland
        or nullish. However, since JSC implements proper tail calls, `Function.prototype.caller`
        result is divergent from other engines if the handler is `Reflect.apply`, which performs
        a tail call that gets optimized away [2] (unless called by another Proxy).

        Partly implement Function.prototype.{caller,arguments} reflection proposal
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158116

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        To ensure web-compatibility, only the safe subset of Function.prototype.{caller,arguments}
        reflection proposal [1] is implemented, which is currently shipped in SpiderMonkey.

        Complete list of differences from the proposed spec:

          1. Cross-realm receiver function is allowed instead of throwing a TypeError.

             Throwing is likely safe to ship, but #225997 needs to be fixed first for
             custom properties to receive correct global object.

          2. Cross-realm caller function is returned instead of `null`.

             Hiding cross-realm caller may break things: we currently have a test for
             the opposite behavior.

          3. Defines "caller" and "arguments" setters that throw for disallowed receivers,
             instead failing silently in sloppy mode.

             This is actually more restrictive than the spec, which is preferable,
             and aligns with V8 and SM.

        Most importantly, this patch removes own "caller" and "arguments" properties from
        sloppy mode ES5 functions. They were non-configurable, making it harder to use
        their holder as a [[ProxyTarget]]. They were also non-writable, with a constantly
        changing [[Value]], which violated the invariants of internal methods [2].

        As a result, JSFunction methods are greatly simplified, especially defineOwnProperty()
        and getOwnSpecialPropertyNames(). The latter is now 2.1x faster according to the
        provided microbenchmark. Also, removes double "prototype" lookup from [[Get]],
        which is a 10% progression.

        [JSC] Call custom accessors / values with their holder's global object

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Just like JS built-ins, getter / setter functions of WebIDL attributes are created in realm
        of their holder interface [1][2], which is their _current_ realm for throwing an error [3].

        With this patch, custom properties get correct global object instead of lexical, including
        when inline cached, aligning them with functions and regular accessors.

        The latter allowed switching JS built-ins to CustomAccessor (e.g. Symbol#description),
        which is slightly more efficient to call from C++, doesn't need reification on first access,
        and has nicer signature.

        Also, renames WASM accessors to drop "func" and removes unused function length parameter.

        Fix uses of Dependency::fence with respect to the compiler outsmarting us
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227757
        <rdar://problem/80280931>

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        We were running into issues on arm64 with respect to the memory model
        ordering of loads, and how the compiler optimized code around Dependency::fence.
        The issue manifested as calls to isMarked incorrectly returning true.
        
        To see the issue, let's consider a program like this:
        a = load(p1)
        b = load(p2)
        if (a != b) return;
        d = Dependency::fence(b)
        
        At the point of defining the dependency, the compiler has proven
        a == b. So, instead of building the dependency on the register used
        for b, we end up using the register for a. So the actual compiled
        code ends up with a dependency on load(p1), not load(p2).
        
        To fix this, we end up adding a new API, Dependency::loadEndFence(pointer,
        result), which is defined as:
        
        template<typename T>
        static Dependency loadAndFence(T* pointer, T& output)
        {
            T value = *opaque(pointer);
            Dependency dependency = Dependency::fence(value);
            output = opaque(value);
            return dependency;
        }
        
        The reason for this is that it split "b" in the above program into two values,
        and the "b" the program compares against is not known to the compiler to be
        the same value that we build a dependency on.

        EON Rd Rn Rm <shift> #amount

        Bitwise Exclusive OR NOT (shifted register) performs a bitwise Exclusive OR NOT 
        of a register value Rn and an optionally-shifted register value Rm, and writes the

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        In r279813, we fixed a race condition related to inlineAccessBaseStructure: while we clear inlineAccessBaseStructure,
        we still run code relying on this field's value until stub version of the code is generated. As a result,
        we run the code which relies on the cells that are already collected. And we have the same problem with
        m_identifier field too. This patch makes m_identifier follow to the same protocol of inlineAccessBaseStructure
        so that we fix this race issue too: both fields will be alive until we switch to the code that are not relying on these
        fields.

        We also make inlineAccessBaseStructure to m_inlineAccessBaseStructure to easily find that this is member field.
        And we also use setWithoutWriteBarrier for m_inlineAccessBaseStructure since we emit codeBlock->vm().heap.writeBarrier(codeBlock)
        immediately after that.

        Add ExtendType to Air::Arg Index to fully utilize address computation in memory instruction for ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227970

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The pattern recognition of address computation in the instructions, e.g., Load 
        Resistor (LDR), Store Register (STR), etc., can benefit the instruction selector.
        Then, the Air operand BaseIndex containing base, index, and scale is introduced 
        to Air opcode. However, the <extend> option of index address is not fully leveraged 
        in the previous implementation. 

        To fill that gap, this patch adds a new member, MacroAssembler::Extend, to the current 
        design of BaseIndex to trigger zero/sign extension on the Index address. And this is 
        enabled for Store/Load with valid index address and shift amount.

        Maybe, the ideal approach is to introduce a decorator (Index@EXT) to the Air operand 
        to provide an extension opportunity for the specific form of the Air opcode.

        Load Register (LDR) calculates an address from a base register value and an 
        offset register value, loads a word from memory, and writes it to a register. 
        The offset register value can optionally be shifted and extended.

        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = Z/SExt32(Trunc(ArgumentReg(%x1)))
        Int @2 = scale
        Int @3 = Shl(@1, @2)
        Int @4 = Add(@0, @3)

        Store Register (STR) calculates an address from a base register value and an 
        offset register value, and stores a 32-bit word or a 64-bit doubleword to the 
        calculated address, from a register.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        There have been reports of flaky failures on the scope.releaseAssertNoException()
        after the call to JSMap::create() in JSModuleLoader::finishCreation().

        The scope.releaseAssertNoException() says that we don't expect the JSMap::create()
        to ever throw an exception.  If the assertion is true, the only way that we can
        see an exception there is if we're throwing an asynchronous TerminationException.

        Since JSModuleLoader::finishCreation() does not have any long running loops, we can
        just DeferTerminationForAWhile and let the next exception check site throw the
        asynchronous TerminationException.  We don't want to just use DeferTermination
        because it will throw the TerminationException right at the end of
        JSModuleLoader::finishCreation(), and the caller of JSModuleLoader::finishCreation()
        may be similarly not expecting an exception to be thrown there.

        Also apply the same treatment to AbstractModuleRecord::finishCreation(), and
        getBackingMap() in WebCore for the same reason.  Other than those, other sites that
        call JSMap::create() already check for exceptions.  So, those sites do not need to
        DeferTerminationForAWhile.

        Convert small JIT pool tests into executable fuzzing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226279

        Right now, we try to test our engine on a small JIT pool. This isn't a known configuration for any
        actual ports and causes issues if we run out of JIT memory when we need to compile an OSR exit.
        Instead of testing such a small pool we should just fuzz each executable allocation that says it
        can fail.

        The current fuzzing doesn't do a good job tracking the number of DFG/FTL compiles when allocations
        fail, so when enabled those tests will just exit early. Also, right now we use a random seed picked
        by the engine for these tests, which makes it hard to reproduce crashes on the bots. If we see
        flakiness on the bots we can have the harness pass in a number so it gets logged in the repro command.

        libpas executable-allocator should reserve more than 256KB for non-fail region at least
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227927

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        libpas jit_heap has mediam allocator which allocates 128KB pages at once. However, our JSC stress tests are setting 100KB
        for small executable memory tests. As a result, under this configuration, we fail immediately after using medium allocator.

        But this test's "total size of executable memory is 100KB" is unrealistic: it is possible that only 100KB memory remains,
        but it is impossible that we reserve only 25KB for non-fail reservation. In production, we are always reserving 128MB. So
        this configuration is not realistic actually.

        So, this patch changes,

            1. If non-fail region is less than 256KB, then we add 256KB and keep this 256KB as non-fail executable allocation. If not,
                use 0.25 ratio as we are doing. This means that Options::jitMemoryReservationSize configures failable region of
                executable memory.
            2. We also revive bytesReserved and bytesAllocated to make memoryPressureMultiplier and early-fail allocation (when there is
                not enough memory and allocation can fail, then we should fail).

        SpeculativeJIT::emitObjectOrOtherBranch used to check the validity of the masqueradesAsUndefined watchpoint twice, and assumed that it could not change in between.
        That is clearly incorrect as the main thread is running concurrently with it, and so the watchpoint could fire at any time.
        The fix is trivial: just check the validity once, and store the result in a boolean.
        If the watchpoint triggers later that is fine: we'll notice and cancel the compilation (see WatchpointCollectionPhase, Plan::isStillValid() and Plan::finalize()).
        The change only protects us from rare and hard-to-reproduce crashes on debug builds caused by an ASSERT firing.

        I did not add a testcase, as I can only reproduce the bug by adding an extra wait in the middle of emitObjectOrOtherBranch.

        Add a new Air::Arg kind ZeroReg to let AIR recognise the new instructions/forms accepting zero register in ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227510

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        B3 is designed to be portable to many kinds of CPUs. However, to effectively 
        compile code to different CPUs, the compiler must eventually make explicit 
        instruction set details. Then, Air is introduced, and it is designed to target 
        individual CPU architectures and generate instructions specific to those CPUs. 

        Previously, Air don't recognize the zero register. This problem has been pointed 
        out in #174821, which was trying to introduce the new opcodes to handle the zero 
        register. 

        To solve this problem in a modular reasoning approach, a new Air operand ZeroReg 
        should be introduced. Its goal is to closely match the CPU instructions 
        accepting the zero register in ARM64. Another reason is that the new overloads 
        of the instructions taking the zero register can benefit instruction selection 
        with this implementation. 

        Here, the ZeroReg is added as a new kind for Air::Arg, which acts as a "high 
        level" operand to be emitted with the associative opcodes. In ARM64, the ZeroReg 
        would be emitted as a zero register.

        Switch the ExecutableAllocator to the libpas jit_heap. The libpas jit_heap uses two size
        categories of bitfit and a large heap, and is happy to do its approximate first-fit in any
        ranges of memory you give it. Jit_heap never allocates metadata inside the memory it manages.
        Allocations and deallocations take a constant-bounded amount of time except for unusual
        situations, and are protected by fine-grained locking in most cases. Decommit follows libpas
        scavenging policy. This alone is a speed-up on Speedometer (probably about 1% or more).

        Also expose some libpas introspection via $vm.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The patch in r277027 to make deletion of GCAwareJITStubRoutines incremental has a
        bug: the routine may not be deleted yet by the incremental sweeper before the next
        GC cycle, and the GC will not be happy visiting dead cell pointers in that routine.
        There is also another bug with the triggering of sweeping.

        For now, we're reverting the patch, and will revisit this at a later time.

        Continue to consult InlineAccess's Structure even after switching to a stub IC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227785

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch fixes a crash in: stress/class-subclassing-function.js
        
        The bug is this:
        1. We initialize a StructureStubInfo to be an inline self access doing a load based on structure S.
        2. We transition to being a PolymorphicAccess based StructureStubInfo. But, we haven't
        generated code yet. We're in the buffered state. So we are still running the inline access
        from (1).  But the StructureStubInfo thinks it's a "Stub".
        3. S is collected
        4. We continue to run code from (1), because when we finalize the IC during GC, it
        doesn't think it's an inline access.
        
        The fix is to always track the structure S that we used when generating the inline
        access, and to only stop tracking it once we've generated code for the Stub.

        Add Air opcode add/sub-and-shift for ARM64 and select this instruction in Air

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch includes two modifications:
            1. Add add/sub-with-shift to Air opcode and the corresponding pattern match for 
               instruction selection.
            2. Minor fix in disassembler.

        Given the operation:

            add/sub Rd, Rn, Rm, ShiftType, amount

        ADD/SUB (shifted register), adds/subs a register value Rn and an optionally-shifted register 
        value Rm, and writes the result to the destination register Rd. The instruction selector 
        can utilize this to lowering certain patterns in B3 IR before further Air optimization. 

        The equivalent pattern would be:

            d = n +/- (m ShiftType amount)

        The other client, Heap::stopIfNecessarySlow() sets m_mutatorDidRun to true after
        calling Heap::stopIfNecessarySlow(unsigned oldState).  Heap::waitForCollector()
        needs to do the same.  Constraint solvers rely on this.

        Without this, one fall out we've seen is that DOMGCOutputConstraint fails to
        visitOutputConstraints, and as a result, opaqueRoots may not get updated.  This
        issue was caught by the GC verifier.

        Speculative fix for this crash.  We are crashing while destroying the VM as we are about to
        release the JSLock.  In JSLock::willReleaseLock(), we release heap access.  Therefore we don't
        need to release it again when undertaking the various shutdown steps in the VM destructor.

        Added a new scope class that will only release and then acquire heap access if the caller
        currently has heap access.

        [JSC] Optimize Object.assign and putDirectInternal
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227677

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch improves Object.assign performance (and this requires putDirectInternal improvement).

        1. Object.assign is handled by DFG / FTL as ObjectAssign node
        2. We found that putDirectInternal is suboptimal. This patch removes several bottlenecks. They are super critical from the measurement of
           microbenchmarks.
            2.1. Creating and destroying DeferredStructureTransitionWatchpointFire is not free. We should do that only when we need it.
            2.2. Before r277620, we are checking m_replacementWatchpointSets's nullptr and that was fast. But after that, we are always
                 calling HashMap::get, and it is not inlined. This means that if we have StructureRareData, we are always calling HashMap::get
                 even though there is no m_replacementWatchpointSets set. This patch adds HashMap::isNullStorage to avoid this call by inlinely
                 check this via `LIKELY(m_replacementWatchpointSets.isNullStorage())`.
            2.3. Structure::addPropertyTransitionToExistingStructure has very cheap fast path and we must inline them to get performance benefit
                 for major single-transition case.

        Added microbenchmarks show significant performance improvements. And Speedometer2 shows 0.6 - 1.0% improvement.

        Fix instruction check failure of UBFX and SBFIZ in testb3 due to the speculative fix in bug 227554
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227563

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch includes two modifications to resolve rdar://79978150:
            1. Fix the bug caused by the patch introducing BFI.
            2. Discard the corresponding speculative fix in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227554.

        The previous patch, added bit field insert (BFI) to AIR opcode, causes the Gmail page 
        hanging issue on Safari. The root cause is the incorrect definition of register role in 
        BFI's AIR opcode. Since BFI inserts a bit field at the low end of the destination register 
        while keeping the high bit unchanged, the destination register should have both roles of 
        use and define simultaneously, which is not (missing use) in the previous patch. 

        This will result in the loss of preserving the value of the destination register, 
        which does happen when browsing the Gmail page on Safari.

            // B3 IR snippets from Gmail
            Int32 b@23  = Add(b@104, b@111, D@100)
            ...
            Int32 b@55  = Const32(65535, D@50)
            Int32 b@137 = BitAnd(b@118, $65535(b@55), D@160)
            Int32 b@168 = Const32(16, D@40)
            Int32 b@141 = Shl(b@137, $16(b@168), D@163)
            Int32 b@143 = BitAnd(b@23, $65535(b@55), D@166)
            Int32 b@144 = BitOr(b@141, b@143, D@169)

        The pattern of BFI is d = ((n & mask1) << lsb) | (d & mask2). So, it is obvious that 
        BFI can be utilized in b@144 where the d is b@23.

            // Incorrect AIR opcode of BFI
            arm64: InsertBitField32 U:G:32, U:G:32, U:G:32, ZD:G:32

            ...
            bfi      w4, w3, #16, #16

        In Air, the added value is stored in the w7. But the value is not preserved after 
        lowering with BFI. To fix this, the use role should be enabled for the destination 
        register.

            // Correnct AIR opcode of BFI
            arm64: InsertBitField32 U:G:32, U:G:32, U:G:32, UZD:G:32

        In addition, BFXIL, which has pattern d = ((n >> lsb) & mask1) | (d & mask2), also needs 
        the similar update.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227013 created ActiveScratchBufferScope.
        It is used by operations that can cause the GC to run, to mark as roots the contents of the scratch buffer that is live during that time (if any).
        The bug is that it simply asks the VM for a scratch buffer of the right size, but this will always return the last scratch buffer, and not necessarily the one that the operation is actually using.

        A fairly simple fix is to pass it directly the scratch buffer, since the operation normally can get it easily enough.
        In most cases the operation has access to the m_buffer field of the ScratchBuffer, but getting a pointer to the entire structure from that is fairly simple (I added ScratchBuffer::fromData() to do so).

        [WebIDL] Rework runtime enabled properties leveraging PropertyCallback
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227275

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        To make the implementation of WebIDL runtime enabled properties independent of eager
        property reification, this change:

        1. Introduces IsLazyPropertyEnabledCallback, which is needed separately from existing
           value callback to maintain the invariant that reifyStaticProperty() always puts a
           property, and to keep enumeration fast.

           Calling disableCaching() isn't enough to achieve correct [[Get]] inline caching,
           so isTaintedByOpaqueObject() is leveraged to prohibit caching of runtime disabled
           properties, just like in operationTryGetByIdOptimize().

           The only case that might seem weird is runtime disabled properties, which were
           enabled after all static properties were reified via [[Delete]], are not appearing.
           It's fixable, yet there is currently no demand for it.

        2. Adds support for LazyPropertyCallback returning GetterSetter / CustomGetterSetter,
           ensuring correct structure flags and slot initialization. Previously, the callback
           was used to init only objects and constructors, using putDirect() unconditionally.

           To avoid mixing other non-basic attributes with PropertyCallback, which would require
           hoisting of checks against PropertyCallback and complicating attribute validation in
           HashTableValue methods, this patch checks the type of callback's return value instead.

           In the future, sticking to this approach will make returning CustomValue impossible
           as it can't be distinguished from CustomAccessor. That's fine because all present
           CustomValue usages merely do lazy init, which PropertyCallback is better suited for.

        Also, this patch:

        3. Expands setUpStaticFunctionSlot() to handle constant integers so the code using
           `Node.ELEMENT_NODE` & friends doesn't regress (proven by attached microbenchmark).

        4. Removes extra checks from setUpStaticPropertySlot(), which is called only on

        Remove unnecessary canBeInternal invocations to mitigate the cost of potential unmatched patterns in B3LowerToAir
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227508

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        The bit pattern doesn't cause worse code generation in the all-internals-are-captured 
        case. So, they don't need canBeInternal checks which might terminate potential matched 
        scenarios.

        The equivalent pattern of SBFIZ is ((src << amount) >> amount) << lsb. Given the code:

        a = x << C
        b = a >> C
        c = b << D

        print(a)
        print(b)
        print(c)

        The pattern won't match because of !canBeInternal for a and b (useCounts > 1). 
        So, this would emit three separate instructions. But if we removed canBeInternal, 
        it would still be just three separate instructions, and they wouldn't be any more 
        expensive. Suppose the print(b) is removed, above. Then, with the canBeInternal check, 
        it is emitting three instructions. Without the canBeInternal check, it would emit only 
        two (x << C and SBFIZ to compute c). And that would be less expensive.

        [JSC] Private names should be handled by usedVariables mechanism
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227476
        rdar://76049469

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Private name handling in the current parser has many problems.

            1. The parser backtracks when it sees destructuring assignment, arrow function etc. In that case, the discarded code
               must not have any effect on the outside of that code. However, private name handling is annotating "used" of the
               upper scopes, which is wrong.
            2. In class expression, private name lookup intentionally skips the class-scope when parsing class heritage. But this
               is not correct since CodeBlock will perform lookup on the normal scope chain and this will look into the class-scope
               inconsistently. This means that we could encounter different private name at runtime. (it is tested in the added test).
            3. We skip inner function parsing when it is parsed previously. At that case, we must preserve private name annotation,
               but restored function information does not preserve that.

        This patch changes how private name is handled.

            1. We were anyway defining #XXX variables which holds private symbols. So we track "use" information by the mechanism used
               for usual variables. We remove Used / Declared bits from PrivateNameEntry since they are not necessary at runtime, and
               these information is handled / tracked in Parser's Scope. For backtracking, we already have a mechanism to roll-back
               m_usedVariables, so using variable mechanism automatically fixes the problem.
            2. We define class-head-scope separately from class-scope. class-heritage expression can see class name, but it cannot use
               private names. Previously, our implementation attempted to achieve that by hacky way: skipping this class-scope for private
               names only while parsing class-heritage. But this was wrong since it does not consider CodeBlock's linking phase as described
               in the problem (2). Instead, we just define class-head-scope which holds class constructor name.
            3. We clean up popScopeInternal to populate lexical-variables and function-stack. Previously, we are stealing them before popping
               the scope when necessary, but this is a hack and a bit wrong since scope's popping operation needs to access these information
               in some cases. Instead, popScopeInternal populates them after popping the scope.

            2. Add Signed Bitfield Extract (SBFX) and Signed Bitfield Insert 
               in Zero (SBFIZ) to Air opcode to serve instruction selector.

        -------------------------------------------------------
        ### Part A Sign extending from a variable bit-width ###
        -------------------------------------------------------
        According to Bit Twiddling Hacks, there are two ways to sign extend bitfield.
        (https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#VariableSignExtend)

        int bf;    // sign extend this width-bit number to bfsx
        int width; // number of bits representing the number in bf
        int bfsx;  // resulting sign-extended number

        Approach 1
        mask1 = (1 << width) - 1
        mask2 = 1 << (width - 1)
        bf    = bf & mask1      // zero bits in bf above position width  
        bfsx  = (bf ^ mask2) - mask2

        Approach 2
        amount = CHAR_BIT * sizeof(bf) - width
        bfsx   = (bf << amount) >> amount

        Then, a new strength reduction rule is introduced:
            Turn this: ((bf & mask1) ^ mask2) - mask2 
            Into this: (bf << amount) >> amount

        -------------------
        ### Part B SBFX ###
        -------------------
        Given instruction:
        sbfx Rd, Rn, lsb, width

        Signed Bitfield Extract (SBFX) extracts width number of adjacent bits at lsb position 
        from a register Rn, sign-extends them to the size of the register, and writes the 
        result to the destination register Rd.

        The equivalent patterns of this instruction are:

        Pattern 1:
            bf    = src >> lsb
            dst   = ((bf & mask1) ^ mask2) - mask2
            mask1 = (1 << width) - 1
            mask2 = 1 << (width - 1) // (mask2 << 1) - 1 = mask1

        Pattern 2:
            bf     = src >> lsb
            amount = CHAR_BIT * sizeof(bf) - width
            dst    = (bf << amount) >> amount
        
        Then, (bf << amount) >> amount is selected as the canonical form with the strength reduction 
        rule introduced above.

        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = lsb
        Int @2 = amount
        Int @3 = ZShr(@0, @1)
        Int @4 = Shl(@3, @2)
        Int @5 = SShr(@4, @2)
        Void@6 = Return(@5, Terminal)

        Before Adding BIC:
        // Old optimized AIR
        Urshift %x0,    lsb, %x0, @3
        Lshift  %x0, amount, %x0, @4
        Rshift  %x0, amount, %x0, @5
        Ret     %x0,              @6

        After Adding BIC:
        // New optimized AIR
        ExtractSignedBitfield %x0, lsb, width, %x0, @5
        Ret                   %x0,                  @6
    
        --------------------
        ### Part B SBFIZ ###
        --------------------
        Given instruction:
        sbfiz Rd, Rn, lsb, width

        Signed Bitfield Insert in Zero (SBFIZ) zeroes the destination register Rd and copies 
        width number of contiguous bits from a source register Rn into lsb position in the 
        destination register, sign-extending the most significant bit of the transferred value.

        The equivalent patterns of this instruction are:

        Pattern 1:
            bfsx  = ((src & mask1) ^ mask2) - mask2
            dst   = bfsx << lsb
            mask1 = (1 << width) - 1
            mask2 = 1 << (width - 1) // (mask2 << 1) - 1 = mask1

        Pattern 2:
            amount = CHAR_BIT * sizeof(bf) - width
            bfsx   = (src << amount) >> amount
            dst    = bfsx << lsb
        
        Then, ((src << amount) >> amount) << lsb is selected as the canonical form with the 
        strength reduction rule introduced above.

        Add a new pattern to instruction selector to use BIC supported by ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227202

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch includes three modifications:
            1. Add bit clear (BIC), or not (ORN), and extract and insert bitfield at the 
               lower end (BFXIL) to Air opcode to serve instruction selector.
            2. Add bitfield clear (BFC) to MacroAssembler.
            4. Do refactoring - rename Air opcodes added in the previous patches.

        ------------------
        ### Part A BIC ###
        ------------------
        Given the operation:

        bic Rd, Rn, Rm

        The BIC (Bit Clear) instruction performs an AND operation on the bits in Rn with the 
        complements of the corresponding bits in the value of Rm. The instruction selector can 
        utilize this to lowering certain patterns in B3 IR before further Air optimization. 
        The equivalent patterns of this instruction are:

        Pattern 1:
            d = n & (-m - 1)

        Pattern 2:
            d = n & (m ^ -1)

        In order to get benefits for complement operation, the current instruction selector uses 
        mvn instruction to lower the pattern value ^ -1. Then, a new strength reduction rule is 
        introduced:
            Turn this: -value - 1 
            Into this: value ^ -1

        So, d = n & (m ^ -1) is selected as the canonical form.

        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = ArgumentReg(%x1)
        Int @2 = -1
        Int @3 = BitXor(@1, @2)
        Int @4 = BitAnd(@0, @3)
        Void@5 = Return(@4, Terminal)

        Before Adding BIC:
        // Old optimized AIR
        Not %x1, %x1,      @3
        And %x0, %x1, %x0, @4
        Ret %x0,           @5

        After Adding BIC:
        // New optimized AIR
        Bic %x0, %x1, %x0, @4
        Ret %x0,           @5

        ------------------
        ### Part A ORN ###
        ------------------
        Given the operation:

        orn Rd, Rn, Rm

        Bitwise OR NOT (shifted register) performs a bitwise (inclusive) OR of a register value 
        Rn and the complement of an optionally-shifted register value Rm, and writes the result 
        to the destination register Rd.

        The equivalent patterns of this instruction are:

        Pattern 1:
            d = n | (-m - 1)

        Pattern 2:
            d = n | (m ^ -1)

        Then, d = n | (m ^ -1) is selected as the canonical form.

        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = ArgumentReg(%x1)
        Int @2 = -1
        Int @3 = BitXor(@1, @2)
        Int @4 = BitOr(@0, @3)
        Void@5 = Return(@4, Terminal)

        Before Adding BIC:
        // Old optimized AIR
        Not %x1, %x1,      @3
        Or  %x0, %x1, %x0, @4
        Ret %x0,           @5

        After Adding BIC:
        // New optimized AIR
        Orn %x0, %x1, %x0, @4
        Ret %x0,           @5

        --------------------
        ### Part A BFXIL ###
        --------------------
        Given the operation:

        bfxil Rd, Rn, lsb, width

        Bitfield extract and insert at low end(BFXIL) copies any number of low-order bits 
        from a source register into the same number of adjacent bits at the low end in 
        the destination register, leaving other bits unchanged.

        The equivalent patterns of this instruction are:

        Pattern 1:
        mask1 = (1 << width) - 1
        mask2 = ~mask1
        ((n >> lsb) & mask1) | (d & mask2)

        Pattern 2:
        mask1 = ((1 << width) - 1) << lsb
        mask2 = ~(mask1 >> lsb)
        ((n & mask1) >> lsb) | (d & mask2)

        Then, introduce a strength reduction rule for easier recognization.
        Turn this: (v & maskShift) >> shiftAmount
        Into this: (v >> shiftAmount) & mask

        with constraints:
        1. maskShift = mask << lsb
        2. mask = (1 << width) - 1
        3. 0 <= shiftAmount < datasize
        4. 0 < width < datasize
        5. shiftAmount + width <= datasize

        The canonical form to match BFXIL is d = ((n >> lsb) & mask1) | (d & mask2).
        
        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = ArgumentReg(%x1)
        Int @2 = lsb
        Int @3 = mask1
        Int @4 = mask2
        Int @5 = BitAnd(@1, @3)
        Int @6 = BitAnd(@0, @4))
        Int @7 = ZShr(@5, @2)
        Int @8 = BitOr(@7, @6)
        Void@9 = Return(@8, Terminal)

        Before Adding BIC:
        // Old optimized AIR
        And                      mask2, %x0,   %x0,      @6
        ExtractUnsignedBitfield    %x1, lsb, width, %x1, @7
        Or                         %x0, %x1,   %x0,      @8
        Ret                        %x0,                  @9

        After Adding BIC:
        // New optimized AIR
        ExtractInsertBitfieldAtLowEnd %x1, lsb, width, %x0, @8
        Ret64                         %x0,                  @9

        --------------
        ### Part B ###
        --------------
        The Bitfield Clear (BFC), leaving other bits unchanged, is similar to BFI which is an 
        alias of BFM. Given the operation:

        bfc Rd, lsb, width

        The equivalent pattern of this instruction is:

        mask = ((1 << width) - 1) << lsb
        d = d & ~mask

        Since mask is a constant and B3 performs constant fold in the optimization phase, this 
        pattern will directly lower to the BitAnd binary operation. So, no need to match this pattern.

        --------------
        ### Part C ###
        --------------
        At MacroAssembler level, the emitters are exepected to be expressed in english 
        (e.g. something like clearBitField for BFC). Do refactoring to rename Air opcode for 
        UBFX, UBFIZ, BFI, and BIC.

        [WASM-Function-References] Add support for (ref null? $t) type constructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226296

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Adds the `ref` type constructor from the typed function references proposal:

          https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/blob/master/proposals/function-references/Overview.md

        It's also required for the type imports and GC proposals as well. Ref types represent
        references to any heap type (including existing funcref and externref) with a specified
        nullability.

        This requires a new isNullable flag in the type representation. This flag also enables
        non-null externref and funcrefs, and hence this commit also adds the necessary checks
        at Wasm/JS boundaries.

        Non-null reference types also generally cannot be used as function locals.

        if appropriate.

        There are 4 spooler classes:
        a. Spooler
           - template base class for LoadRegSpooler and StoreRegSpooler.
           - encapsulates the batching strategy for load / store pairs.

        b. LoadRegSpooler - specializes Spooler to handle load pairs.
        b. StoreRegSpooler - specializes Spooler to handle store pairs.

        d. CopySpooler
           - handles matching loads with stores.
           - tries to emit loads as load pairs if possible.
           - tries to emot stores as store pairs if possible.
           - ensures that pre-requisite loads are emitted before stores are emitted.
           - other than loads, also support constants and registers as sources of values
             to be stored.  This is useful in OSR exit ramps where we may materialize a
             stack value to store from constants or registers in addition to values we
             load from the old stack frame or from a scratch buffer.

        In this patch, we also do the following:

        1. Use spoolers in many places so that we can emit load / store pairs instead of
           single load / stores.  This helps shrink JIT code side, and also potentially
           improves performance.

        2. In DFG::OSRExit::compileExit(), we used to recover constants into a scratch
           buffer, and then later, load from that scratch buffer to store into the
           new stack frame(s).

           This patch changes it so that we defer constant recovery until the final
           loop where we store the recovered value directly into the new stack frame(s).
           This saves us the work (and JIT code space) for storing into a scratch buffer
           and then reloading from the scratch buffer.

           There is one exception: tmp values used by active checkpoints.  We need to call
           operationMaterializeOSRExitSideState() to materialize the active checkpoint
           side state before the final loop where we now recover constants.  Hence, we
           need these tmp values recovered before hand.

           So, we check upfront if we have active checkpoint side state to materialize.
           If so, we'll eagerly recover the constants for initializing those tmps.

           We also use the CopySpooler in the final loop to emit load / store pairs for
           filling in the new stack frame(s).

           One more thing: it turns out that the vast majority of constants to be recovered
           is simply the undefined value.  So, as an optimization, the final loop keeps
           the undefined value in a register, and has the spooler store directly from
           that register when appropriate.  This saves on JIT code to repeatedly materialize
           the undefined JSValue constant.

        3. In reifyInlinedCallFrames(), replace the use of GPRInfo::nonArgGPR0 with
           GPRInfo::regT4.  nonArgGPRs are sometimes map to certain regTXs on certain ports.
           Replacing with regT4 makes it easier to ensure that we're not trashing the
           register when we use more temp registers.

           reifyInlinedCallFrames() will be using emitSaveOrCopyLLIntBaselineCalleeSavesFor()
           later where we need more temp registers.

        4. Move the following functions to AssemblyHelpers.cpp.  They don't need to be
           inline functions.  Speedometer2 and JetStream2 shows that making these non
           inline does not hurt performance:

                AssemblyHelpers::emitSave(const RegisterAtOffsetList&);
                AssemblyHelpers::emitRestore(const RegisterAtOffsetList&);
                AssemblyHelpers::emitSaveCalleeSavesFor(const RegisterAtOffsetList*);
                AssemblyHelpers::emitSaveOrCopyCalleeSavesFor(...);
                AssemblyHelpers::emitRestoreCalleeSavesFor(const RegisterAtOffsetList*);
                AssemblyHelpers::copyLLIntBaselineCalleeSavesFromFrameOrRegisterToEntryFrameCalleeSavesBuffer(...);

           Also renamed emitSaveOrCopyCalleeSavesFor() to emitSaveOrCopyLLIntBaselineCalleeSavesFor()
           because it is only used with baseline codeBlocks.

        Add a new pattern to instruction selector to utilize BFI supported by ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227201

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Bitfield insert(BFI), leaving other bits unchanged. The instruction selector 
        can utilize this to lowering certain patterns in B3 IR before further Air 
        optimization. Given the operation:

        bfi d, n, lsb, width

        The equivalent pattern would be:

        Pattern 1:
            mask1 = ((1 << width) - 1) << lsb
            mask2 = ~mask1
            d = ((n << lsb) & mask1) | (d & mask2);

        Pattern 2:
            mask1 = (1 << width) - 1
            mask2 = ~(mask1 << lsb)
            d = ((n & mask1) << lsb) | (d & mask2)

        Current optimizer already has the strength reduction rule:
            Turn This: (n << lsb) & mask1)
            Into This: (n & mask1) << lsb)

        Then, d = ((n & mask1) << lsb) | (d & mask2) is the canonical form.

        With constraints:
            1. 0 <= lsb < datasize
            2. 0 < width < datasize

        Add a new pattern to instruction selector to utilize UBFIZ supported by ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227204

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch includes three parts:
            A) Add UBFIZ to instruction selector.
            B) Fix UBFX, introduced in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226984, 
               to match all patterns. 
            C) Fix error condition in one strength reduction rule introduced 
               in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227138.

        Part A
        Unsigned Bitfield Insert in Zero(UBFIZ), supported by ARM64, zeros the 
        destination register and copies any number of contiguous bits from a 
        source register into any position in the destination register. The 
        instruction selector can utilize this to lowering certain patterns in 
        B3 IR before further Air optimization. 

        Given the operation: ubfiz d, n, lsb, width

        This is equivalent to "d = (n << lsb) & (((1 << width) - 1) << lsb)". 
        Since wasm introduces constant folding, then the matched patterns would be:
        1.1 d = (n << lsb) & maskShift
        1.2 d = maskShift & (n << lsb)

        2.1 d = (n & mask) << lsb
        2.2 d = (mask & n) << lsb

        Where:
            maskShift = mask << lsb
            mask = (1 << width) - 1

        To make the pattern matching in instruction selection beneficial to JIT, these 
        constraints should be introduced:
            1. 0 <= lsb < datasize
            2. 0 < width < datasize
            3. lsb + width <= datasize

        Choose (n & mask) << lsb as the canonical form and introduce a strength reduction.
        Turn this: (n << lsb) & maskShift
        Into this: (n & mask) << lsb

        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = lsb
        Int @2 = 0b0110
        Int @3 = Shl(@0, @1)
        Int @4 = BitAnd(@3, @2)  
        Void@5 = Return(@4, Terminal)      

        Before Adding UBFIZ Pattern:
        // Old optimized AIR
        Lshift  %x0, $62, %x0, @3
        And  0b0110, %x0, %x0, @4
        Ret     %x0,           @5

        After Adding UBFIZ Pattern:
        // New optimized AIR
        Ubfiz %x0, lsb, 2, %x0, @4
        Ret   %x0,              @5

        Part B
        Fix UBFX to match both patterns:
        dest = (src >> lsb) & mask
        dest = mask & (src >> lsb)

        Where:
        1. mask = (1 << width) - 1
        2. 0 <= lsb < datasize
        3. 0 < width < datasize
        4. lsb + width <= datasize       

        Part C
        Fix one B3 strength reduction.
        Turn this: (src >> shiftAmount) & mask
        Into this: src >> shiftAmount

        With updated constraints:
        1. mask = (1 << width) - 1
        2. 0 <= shiftAmount < datasize
        3. 0 < width < datasize
        4. shiftAmount + width >= datasize

        [JSC] Fix consistency check during stack splitting in Wasm::LLIntGenerator::addLoop
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226012

        Reviewed by Tadeu Zagallo.

        It is possible for the wasm llint generator to call
        checkConsistency() on a stack that is only halfway through being
        properly setup. Specifically, when generating a loop block, we use
        splitStack() to pop the arguments for the loop into a new stack,
        and materializeConstantsAndLocals() to materialize the constants
        and aliases in the loop arguments, but the arguments won't be
        added back to the stack until the very end of the loop code
        generation. Since materializeConstantsAndLocals() will check the
        correctness of the expression stack, which isn't yet fully formed,
        we'll fail its ASSERT. To workaround this, we create a variant of
        materializeConstantsAndLocals() that does not check for
        correctness (similar to what we do in push()), and manually check
        the correctness of the new split stack in
        Wasm::LLIntGenerator::addLoop(), which is the place that knows the
        details of this intermediate state.

        Add a new pattern to instruction selector to utilize SMSUBL supported by ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227195

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Signed Multiply-Subtract Long(SMSUBL), supported by ARM64, multiplies two 
        32-bit register values, subtracts the product from a 64-bit register value, 
        and writes the result 64-bit destination register. The instruction selector 
        can utilize this to lowering certain patterns in B3 IR before further Air 
        optimization. Given the operation:

        smsubl d, n, m, a

        The equivalent pattern would be:

        d = a - SExt32(n) * SExt32(m)

        Given B3 IR:
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%x0)
        Int @1 = SExt32(Trunc(ArgumentReg(%x1)))
        Int @2 = SExt32(Trunc(ArgumentReg(%x2)))
        Int @3 = Mul(@1, @2)
        Int @4 = Sub(@0, @3)
        Void@5 = Return(@4, Terminal)

        Before Adding SMSUBL:

        Add a new pattern to B3ReduceStrength based on Bug 226984

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        In the previous patch bug 226984, a new pattern could be introduced to 
        B3ReduceStrength.cpp for further optimization, which is that:

        dest = (src >> shiftAmount) & mask

        is equivalent to

        src >> shiftAmount

        under these constraints:

        1. shiftAmount >= 0 
        2. mask has a binary format in contiguous ones starting from the 
           least significant bit.
        3. shiftAmount + bitCount(mask) == maxBitWidth

        For instance (32-bit):

        (src >> 12) & 0x000fffff == src >> 12

        This reduction is more beneficial than UBFX in this case.  

        // B3 IR
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%0)
        Int @1 = 12
        Int @2 = ZShr(@0, @1)

        [DFG] Untyped branches should eliminate checks based on results from the AbstractInterpreter
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227159

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        We currently emit a ton of code for Untyped branches, as we use branchIfTruthy which does not know anything about the abstract interpreter.
        Even worse: we call branchIfTruthy after emitting some fast paths, and branchIfTruthy replicates these fast paths (Int32 and Booleans).
        While I plan to reduce the number of Untyped branches in some separate patches, there is a very long tail of predicted types visible in benchmarks, so I expect some of them to remain no matter what, justifying making the code emitted in that case more reasonable.

        The implementation in this patch is fairly straightforward, as it follows very closely branchOnValue() from AssemblyHelpers (which was previously called through branchIfTruthy).

        It was tested on the JSC stress tests, as well as on JetStream2.

        On JetStream2, it reduced the average number of bytes emitted for Branch by the DFG from 30.1 to 27.5 (highly significant, it only changes by about 0.1 between runs).
        Since only about 1.5k branches are untyped out of 34k in that benchmark, it means that this patch reduces the amount of code emitted for untyped branches by about 50 bytes on average.

        Add a new pattern to instruction selector to utilize UBFX supported by ARM64
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226984

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        UBFX, supported by ARM64, copies adjacent bits from the source register into 
        the least significant bits of a destination register in zero extension. The 
        instruction selector can utilize this to lowering certain patterns in B3 IR 
        before further Air optimization.

        ubfx dest, src, lsb, width
           tmp, tmp, imm, imm

        This is equivalent to "dest = (src >> lsb) & ((1 << width) - 1)". Since wasm 
        introduces constant folding, then the pattern would be:

        dest = (src >> lsb) & mask

        where the mask should have a binary format in contiguous ones starting from 
        the least significant bit. For example:

        0b00111111

        To make the pattern matching in instruction selection beneficial to JIT, these 
        constraints should be introduced:

        1. lsb >= 0 
        2. width > 0
        3. lsb + width <= bit field limit (32 or 64)

        Given:
        // B3 IR
        Int @0 = ArgumentReg(%0)
        Int @1 = lsb
        Int @2 = 0b0011
        Int @3 = ZShr(@0, @1)
        Int @4 = BitAnd(@3, @2)  
        Void@5 = Return(@4, Terminal)      

        w/o UBFX Pattern:
        // Old optimized AIR
        Urshift %x0, lsb, %x0, @3
        And  0b0011, %x0, %x0, @4

        w/ UBFX Pattern:

        Ubfx %x0, lsb, 2, %x0, @4
        Ret  %x0,              @5

        Note:
        Suppose a 32-bit version of (src >> 20) & 0x0FFF, it is equivalent to src >> 20. 
        In this case, Logical Shift Right should be utilized instead when:

        lsb + width == bit field limit (32 or 64)

        This case/pattern should be added and upadated in the future patch.

        We also use KeywordLookup.h's COMPARE_XCHARS to perform "true" / "false" / "null" lexing in JSON parser.

        Trivial fix to a broken rebase: while it is ok to share most code between DelById and DelByVal, only the latter has a child2(), so it should not be accessed if we are compiling the former.
        No new test, as it was caught by one of our existing tests.

        Add Air opcode sub32/64(Reg, Imm, Reg) form for ARM64 and select this instruction in Air
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226937

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Previously, Air arm64 sub32/64 utilize sub(Imm, Tmp) at optlevel = 0 and 
        add(Tmp, -Imm) at optlevel > 0 to perform and optimize sub(Tmp, Imm, Tmp).
        The issue with this is that we were not eliding redundant operations. 

        For example:
        // B3 IR
        @0 = Trunc(ArgumentReg(0))
        @1 = Const
        @2 = Sub(@0, @1)
        @3 = Return(@2)

        // Old optimized Air IR
        // OptLevel = 0
        Move    %x0, %tmp1, @0
        Move $Const, %tmp2, @1
        Move  %tmp1, %tmp0, @2 // Redundant
        Sub  $Const, %tmp0, @2
        Move  %tmp0,   %x0, @3
        Ret32   %x0,        @3

        To remove those redundant instructions, Air arm64 sub32/64 opcode should 
        indicate a new form sub(Tmp, Imm, Tmp).

        Drop the FTL(DFG) graph after lowering to B3
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226556

        Reviewed by Phil Pizlo.

        This patch originally landed as r278463, was reverted in r278463.
        I believe that the bug for which it was reverted actually comes from r278371, which was also reverted at the same time. So I am now relanding this.

        The challenge in this patch was dealing with all of the Patchpoints created by FTLLowerDFGToB3: they get a lambda at that time, which they execute at the end of Air, and many of these lambdas were capturing a pointer to some parts of the DFG graph and reading through it when being executed.
        In all cases but one it was easily fixed: they were only reading a few bits from a given node, so I just read these bits in FTLLowerDFGToB3, and captured them (by value) instead of the pointer to the node.
        The exception was compileCallOrConstructVarargsSpread(): its patchpoint generator was walking through the graph, flattening a tree of PhantomSpread/PhantomNewArrayWithSpread/PhantomNewArrayBuffer/PhantomCreateRest, emitting some code along the way.
        We now do this flattening of the tree in FTLLowerDFGToB3, store just enough information to later emit the required code in a vector, and capture that vector in the lambda (through a move capture, which is allowed since C++14). See `struct VarargsSpreadArgumentToEmit` for the information that we need to store in that vector.

        I tested this change by completing a full run of JetStream2 with ASAN.
        I also ran the stress tests with "spread" in their name in Debug mode.

        RegisterSet should be smaller

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        Previously, every RegisterSet would have an extra 64-bit word in it just to hold state
        relevant to hashtable keys.

        But RegisterSet is almost never used as a hashtable key.

        This patch moves the hashtable key support into a subclass, HashableRegisterSet. That class
        ends up only being used in one place.

        On ARM64, this makes RegisterSet use 64 bits instead of 128 bits.

        On X86_64, this makes RegisterSet use 32 bits instead of 64 bits.

        AssemblyHelpers should save/restore callee save FPRs

        <rdar://77080162>

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We have 3 functions in AssemblyHelpers to save and restore callee save registers that were filtering
        out any FPRs. This is an issue since we do have callee save FPRs in arm64 and these functions can be
        called from the FTL, and FTL uses those callee saves. The test case shows how that's an issue with tail
        calls on FTL: the callee saves are correctly stored in the prologue and restored in the epilogue, but
        when emitting a tail call we use AssemblyHelpers::emitRestoreCalleeSaves to restore the callee saves,
        which doesn't restore FPRs. This results in the callee save FPRs being trashed. To fix this we just need
        to stop filtering out the FPRs, if they are listed as used by the code block they should be saved/restored
        accordingly. I also changed DFGOSREntry to stop filtering out the callee save FPRs and instead assert
        there aren't any, since they aren't currently used in the DFG, but it could help avoid the same issue in
        the future.

        [JSC] Optimize JSON.parse with small content by dropping single character Identifier pool
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227057

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Profiler results and investigation suggest interesting things.

            1. Sampling profiler says Flight-TodoMVC is mostly JSON.parse benchmark.
            2. Each JSON data of Flight-TodoMVC is small. And JSON.parse is super frequently called.
            3. In the case of JSON.parse with small data, LiteralParser's construction / destruction costs much since
               it has large Identifier pool with std::array<>.

        As a simple first step, this patch removes single character Identifier pool from LiteralParser since
        the exact same Identifier data can be retrieved from VM's SmallStrings.

        We created a microbenchmark from Flight-TodoMVC's data, and the result is roughly 20% better.
        And we observed 0.6% improvement in Speedometer2.

        Move setting of scratch buffer active lengths to the runtime functions.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227013
        rdar://79325068

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        We previously emit JIT'ed code to set and unset the ScratchBuffer active length
        around calls into C++ runtime functions.  This was needed because the runtime
        functions may allow GC to run, and GC needs to be able to scan the values stored
        in the ScratchBuffer.

        In this patch, we change it so that the runtime functions that need it will
        declare an ActiveScratchBufferScope RAII object that will set the ScratchBuffer
        active length, and unset it on exit.  This allows us to:

        1. Emit less JIT code.  The runtime function can take care of it.
        2. Elide setting the ScratchBuffer active length if not needed.  The runtime
           functions know whether they can GC or not.  They only need to set the active
           length if they can GC.

        Note that scanning of the active ScratchBuffer is done synchronously on the
        mutator thread via Heap::gatherScratchBufferRoots(), which is called as part of
        the GC conservative root scan.  This means there is no urgency / sequencing that
        requires that the active length be set before calling into the runtime function.
        Setting it in the runtime function itself is fine as long as it is done before
        the function executes any operations that can GC.

        This patch also made the following changes:

        1. Introduce ActiveScratchBufferScope RAII object used to set/unset the
           ScratchBuffer length in the runtime functions.  ActiveScratchBufferScope takes
           the active length in units of number of stack slots / Registers / JSValues
           instead of bytes.

        2. Deleted ScratchRegisterAllocator::preserveUsedRegistersToScratchBufferForCall()
           and ScratchRegisterAllocator::restoreUsedRegistersFromScratchBufferForCall().
           These functions are unused.

        The reasoning behind what values to pass to ActiveScratchBufferScope, is any:

        1. AssemblyHelpers::debugCall() in AssemblyHelpers.cpp:
           The ScratchBuffer is only used for operationDebugPrintSpeculationFailure(),
           which now declares an ActiveScratchBufferScope.

           The active length is GPRInfo::numberOfRegisters + FPRInfo::numberOfRegisters.
           See scratchSize in AssemblyHelpers::debugCall().

        2. genericGenerationThunkGenerator() in FTLThunks.cpp:
           The scratch buffer size for determining the active length is
           requiredScratchMemorySizeInBytes().  

           However, genericGenerationThunkGenerator() generates code to call either
           operationCompileFTLOSRExit() or operationCompileFTLLazySlowPath().  Both of
           these functions will DeferGCForAWhile.  Hence, GC cannot run, and we don't need
           to set the active length here.

        3. compileArrayPush() in FTLLowerDFGToB3.cpp:

           Cases Array::Int32, Array::Contiguous, or Array::Double calls
           operationArrayPushMultiple() or operationArrayPushDoubleMultiple().

           For operationArrayPushMultiple(), the active length is elementCount.  See
           computation of scratchSize.

           For operationArrayPushDoubleMultiple(), we don't need to set the active length
           because the ScratchBuffer only contains double values.  The GC does not need
           to scan those.

           Case Array::ArrayStorage calls operationArrayPushMultiple().
           The active length is elementCount.  See computation of scratchSize.

           compileNewArray() in FTLLowerDFGToB3.cpp:

           Calls operationNewArray().  Active length is m_node->numChildren(), which is
           passed to operationNewArray() as the size parameter.  See computation of
           scratchSize.

           compileNewArrayWithSpread() in FTLLowerDFGToB3.cpp:

           Calls operationNewArrayWithSpreadSlow().  Active length is m_node->numChildren(),
           which is passes to operationNewArrayWithSpreadSlow() as the numItems parameter.
           See computation of scratchSize.

        4. osrExitGenerationThunkGenerator() in DFGThunks.cpp:

           Calls operationCompileOSRExit().  Active length is GPRInfo::numberOfRegisters +
           FPRInfo::numberOfRegisters.  See computation of scratchSize.

        5. compileNewArray() in DFGSpeculativeJIT.cpp:

           Calls operationNewArray().  Active length is node->numChildren(), which is
           passed in as the size parameter.

           compileNewArrayWithSpread() in DFGSpeculativeJIT.cpp:

           Calls operationNewArrayWithSpreadSlow().  Active length is node->numChildren(),
           which is passed in as the numItems parameter.

           compileArrayPush() in DFGSpeculativeJIT.cpp:

           Calls operationArrayPushMultiple().  Active length is elementCount, which is
           passed in as the elementCount parameter.

           Calls operationArrayPushDoubleMultiple().  Active length is elementCount, but
           we don't need to set it because the ScratchBuffer only contains double values.

        [JSC] Workaround ICU uloc_addLikelySubtags / uloc_minimizeSubtags bugs

        Reviewed by Ross Kirsling.

        ICU has bugs that uloc_addLikelySubtags / uloc_minimizeSubtags cannot handle very long locale ID that exceeds ULOC_FULLNAME_CAPACITY,
        while these functions can take arbitrary sized buffer for output. This can be achieved simply by (1) attaching many unicode extensions,
        or (2) having many variants.

        In this patch, we add a workaround: if uloc_addLikelySubtags / uloc_minimizeSubtags failed, we perform them without having locale ID
        keywords part. After performing the operations, we append these keywords back.

        This is workaround, and still this workaround is not complete since we could have many variants. In that case, uloc_addLikelySubtags / uloc_minimizeSubtags
        still fails, and in that case, for now, we give up performing uloc_addLikelySubtags / uloc_minimizeSubtags. Fixing this needs to be
        done in ICU side: https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21639

        Add ldp and stp support for FP registers, plus some bug fixes.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226998
        rdar://79313717

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        This patch does the following:
        1. Add ldp and stp support for FP registers.
           This simply entails providing wrappers that take FPRegisterID and passing true
           for the V bit to the underlying loadStoreRegisterPairXXX encoding function.
           V is for vector (aka floating point).  This will cause bit 26 in the instruction
           to be set indicating that it's loading / storing floating point registers.

        2. Add ARM64 disassembler support ldp and stp for FP registers.
           This includes fixing A64DOpcodeLoadStoreRegisterPair::mask to not exclude the
           FP versions of the instructions.

        3. Add ARM64Assembler query methods for determining if an immediate is encodable
           as the signed 12 bit immediate of ldp and stp instructions.

        4. Fix ldp and stp offset form to take an int instead of an unsigned.  The
           immediate it takes is a 12-bit signed int, not unsigned.

        5. In loadStoreRegisterPairXXX encoding functions used by the forms of ldp and stp,
           RELEASE_ASSERT that the passed in immediate is encodable.  Unlike ldur / stur,
           there is no form of ldp / stp that takes the offset in a register that can be
           used as a fail over.  Hence, if the immediate is not encodable, this is a
           non-recoverable event.  The client is responsible for ensuring that the offset
           is encodable.

        6. Added some testmasm tests for testing the offset form (as opposed to PreIndex
           and PostIndex forms) of ldp and stp.  We currently only use the offset form
           in our JITs.

        Add Air opcode sub32/64(Reg, Imm, Reg) form for ARM64 and select this instruction in Air
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226937

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Previously, Air arm64 sub32/64 utilize sub(Imm, Tmp) at optlevel = 0 and 
        add(Tmp, -Imm) at optlevel > 0 to perform and optimize sub(Tmp, Imm, Tmp).
        The issue with this is that we were not eliding redundant operations. 

        For example:
        // B3 IR
        @0 = Trunc(ArgumentReg(0))
        @1 = Const
        @2 = Sub(@0, @1)
        @3 = Return(@2)

        // Old optimized Air IR
        // OptLevel = 0
        Move    %x0, %tmp1, @0
        Move $Const, %tmp2, @1
        Move  %tmp1, %tmp0, @2 // Redundant
        Sub  $Const, %tmp0, @2
        Move  %tmp0,   %x0, @3
        Ret32   %x0,        @3

        To remove those redundant instructions, Air arm64 sub32/64 opcode should

        We should drop B3 values while running Air
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226187

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        NB: this patch first landed as r278371, then was reverted in r278587 as it broke --dumpDisassembly().
        I fixed the bug (a missing line setDisassembler()) and am now re-landing it. Below is a copy of the original Changelog.

        We must keep the following values:
        - WasmBoundsCheck, to know whether it is Pinned or Maximum, and if it is pinned find its argument.
        - CCall/Patch/Check/CheckAdd/CheckSub/CheckMul and all of their children, because all of these are lowered to Air::Patchpoint, which needs to know the type of its arguments, and does so by looking at the children of its        origin.
        I intend to fix these in later patches if possible.

        Finally we must preserve all B3 values in the following cases:
        - if we dump the disassembly or the Air graph: because otherwise we cannot print the origins
        - if we are using the sampling profiler, because it relies on PCToCodeOriginMap which we cannot accurately fill without these origins.

        We must also keep m_tuples alive, as it is used by Patchpoints in Air to understand the types of their arguments.
        We also don't touch StackSlots (in this patch), because one of them is captured by FTL::State.

        Also now PCToOriginMap has a Vector with no inline capacity, since it is either quite large (if needed) or empty (otherwise).

        The performance impact of this is a progression on various RAMification subtests on Mac, but is more mitigated on iPhone7, with various regressions.
        I suspect these to be noise, and will monitor the performance bots post-landing to make sure of it.

        Air ARM64 sub32 opcode should indicate that it zero-extends its result

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Sub32 was previously not saying that its result is zero defined. However,
        sub32 on arm64 architectures zero defines its result, so the top 32 bits
        are zeroed. The issue with this is what we were not eliding provably
        redundant zero extend operations.

        For example:
        // B3 IR
        @0 = Trunc(ArgumentReg(0))
        @1 = Trunc(ArgumentReg(1))
        @2 = Sub(@0, @1)
        @3 = ZExt32(@2) // i64
        @4 = Return(@3) or Store(@3, @x)

        To remove that redundant zero extend instruction (Move32), Air arm64

        It looks like the issue is that we aren't checking for the
        presence of dropped locks when deciding to drain microtasks during
        JSLock::unlock. This meant that when we drop all locks when
        calling out to API clients we would drain our microtasks at that
        point. An alternative would be to pass an extra parameter to the
        unlock function that says not to drain microtasks. I chose not to
        do that since it seemed a bit less robust.

        This patch is very likely to break existing API users. So I'm adding
        a linked on or after check to protect existing Apps.

        Lastly, change our Poker Bros check to use applicationSDKVersion too
        so others trying to add a linked on or after check don't use
        the dyld function directly too.

        [JSC] Rename *ByIdVariant to *ByVariant and *ByKind::Normal to *ByKind::ById

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Cleanup patch following r278445.

        1. {Get, Delete, In}ByStatus (but not `Put`) have had `Id` removed from their names; likewise, remove `Id`
           from the names of {Get, Delete, In}ByIdVariant. These are used *before* ByVal has been converted to ById.

        2. The {Get, Del, In}ByKind enum classes shouldn't really call ById `Normal` -- let's say `ById` explicitly.

        3. Bonus: In DFGBytecodeParser, move some *Status::computeFor calls inside the conditional that uses them.

        Original patch by Angelos Oikonomopoulos.

        The cast was sign-extending the JSValue address in 32 bits, so that addresses
        that had the most significant set gave us a sign-extended result in
        asNumber which was then converted to an invalid NaN by the bitcast.

        Instead, cast the address to uintptr_t, and the result will be promoted
        uint64_t without sign-extending the address.

        [JSC] Use DataIC for AccessCase
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226072

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Filip Pizlo.

        This patch adds non-repatching IC for Baseline JIT in ARM64.
        This does not work in non-ARM64 architectures (including X64) due to the use of link-register.

        1. We add non-repatching IC, which is enabled only in Baseline due to performance reason. We are using the
           existing IC in DFG and FTL. Non-repatching includes fast-path, and slow-path's operation function.
        2. We still keep InlineAccess in all tiers. Removing that causes 0.3 ~ 1.0% regression in Speedometer2. This
           means that we still need some repatching when we first introduce stubs.
        3. We add a mechanism to share generated code stubs in non-repatching IC. Currently, getter / setter / custom
           accessors are excluded since their code relies on JSGlobalObject, CodeBlock etc. which are not included in
           AccessCase's data structure.
        4. This patch still relies on that CodeBlock will be destroyed synchronously since we need to ensure that sharing-hash-table
           does not include already-dead JIT code stubs. We can fix it (e.g. annotating epoch to these stubs, bump them in
           finalizeUnconditionally), but we avoid doing that to prevent from further enlarging this patch. This patch is already
           significant in its size.
        5. Added callOperation(Address) support in CCallHelpers, which can save the target in nonArgGPR0, and call it so that we can use
           Address including GPR which is also used for arguments.

        Performance is neutral in JetStream2 and Speedometer2. But it offers the way to remove some code generation in Baseline.

        [JSC] Use ResolvedClosureVar to get brand from scope
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226677
        rdar://78802869

        Private brand lookup is doing wrong way to get scope.

            1. op_resolve_scope with private name (e.g. #x)
            2. then, doing op_get_from_scope with (1)'s scope with different name (e.g. @privateBrand)

        This is wrong in JSC. We resolve scope at link-time in CodeBlock. So we need to ensure that both op_resolve_scope and op_get_from_scope
        starts with the current scope-register. As a result, private-brand lookup is broken right now. Let's see the buggy case.

            class D {
              #x() {}
              m() {
                class C {
                  #yy;
                  #z() { }
                  a() {
                    this.#x(); // <===== This point.
                  }
                }
                let c = new C();
                c.a();
              }
            }

        In the above point, we first lookup the scope with #x, and we get the D's class-scope. But our get_from_scope is using privateBrand, and
        privateBrand property exists too in C's class-scope too since C also has #yy and #z. As a result, CodeBlock linking configures the offset for
        C's class-scope in get_from_scope. And this offset is different from D's class-scope's privateBrand.

        Only allowed case for the above usage is ResolvedClosureVar. And generatorification uses it too. In this patch,

        1. We ensure that class-scope (with private name) must have @privateBrand and @privateClassBrand with offset 1 and 0.
        2. Use ResolvedClosureVar with the above pre-defined offset

        Since CodeBlock's linking does not resolve the scope for get_from_scope if it is ResolvedClosureVar, we can just perform the desired ResolvedClosureVar lookup
        with the given scope with the compiled offset.

        Unreviewed, reland r276592 with a fix for put() override in prototype chain of a JSProxy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226185

        The API test added in r278366 revealed a flaw in JSObject::definePropertyOnReceiver()
        that caused putDirectInternal() to be performed on a JSProxy instead of it's target.
        Remedies that via a type check, ensuring the test and iOS apps are functional.

        The issue was originally missed because the prototype chain of a global object is immutable
        and none of the global object's prototypes override put(). OpaqueJSClass::prototype() sets
        the [[Prototype]] directly, ignoring the IsImmutablePrototypeExoticObject type info flag.

        Also, excludes an invariant from the original patch that required put() to be overriden
        when implementing custom [[DefineOwnProperty]]. It is now broken by WindowProperties object.

        Introduce LexicalScopeFeatures to enable future bytecode optimizations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224072

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Before this patch, BytecodeGenerator was capable of reasoning about the presence of `with`
        statements, direct `eval`, or any other code features only within the current executable:

            ```
            with (foo) {
                (function() {
                    // There was no way to detect WithScope during generation of this function.
                })();
            }
            ```

        This change is required for op_to_this rewrite (#225397): if FunctionCallResolveNode and
        friends knew there is no WithScope, op_call could be emitted with |this| value of
        `undefined` as per spec [1], instead of resolved scope. This would:
          - simplify op_to_this on all tiers, likely resulting in minor perf boost;
          - save 1 instruction per strict function by removing op_to_this;
          - remove toThis() from the method table and ~30 its call sites from built-ins;
          - fix built-in methods that were observably lacking toThis();
          - fix __proto__ getter / setter called on global scope;
          - fix WebIDL accessors called with |this| value of `undefined` and `null`.

        Also, if ResolveNode knew that unforgeable global properties are not shadowed and there
        is no `with` statement or sloppy mode direct `eval`, then `undefined` / `Infinity` / `NaN`
        lookups could be constant-folded. This would save up to 3 bytecode ops per each usage
        and allow emitting op_is_undefined_or_null for `x === undefined || x === null`.
        V8 performs this optimization [2].

        This patch introduces LexicalScopeFeatures to allow passing such information from Parser
        to BytecodeGenerator with a minimal code diff. These features are kept separate from
        CodeFeature to simplify reasoning about feature's scope and because we need to propagate
        lexical features from parent to child scope.

        Strict mode is the first use case of LexicalScopeFeatures, which this change carefully
        fits into existing abstractions without increasing their memory usage even by 1 byte.

        Put the Baseline JIT prologue and op_loop_hint code in JIT thunks.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226375

        Reviewed by Keith Miller and Robin Morisset.

        Baseline JIT prologue code varies in behavior based on several variables.  These
        variables include (1) whether the prologue does any arguments value profiling,
        (2) whether the prologue is for a constructor, and (3) whether the compiled
        CodeBlock will have such a large frame that it is greater than the stack reserved
        zone (aka red zone) which would require additional stack check logic.

        The pre-existing code would generate specialized code based on these (and other
        variables).  In converting to using thunks for the prologue, we opt not to
        convert these specializations into runtime checks.  Instead, the implementation
        uses 1 of 8 possible specialized thunks to reduce the need to pass arguments for
        runtime checks.  The only needed argument passed to the prologue thunks is the
        codeBlock pointer.

        There are 8 possible thunks because we specialize based on 3 variables:
        1. doesProfiling
        2. isConstructor
        3. hasHugeFrame

        2**3 yields 8 permutations of prologue thunk specializations.

        Similarly, there are also 8 analogous arity fixup prologues that work similarly.

        The op_loop_hint thunk only takes 1 runtime argument: the bytecode offset.

        We've tried doing the loop_hint optimization check in the thunk (in order to move
        both the fast and slow path into the thunk for maximum space savings).  However,
        this seems to have some slight negative impact on benchmark performance.  We ended
        up just keeping the fast path and instead have the slow path call a thunk to do
        its work.  This realizes the bulk of the size savings without the perf impact.

        This patch also optimizes op_enter a bit more by eliminating the need to pass any
        arguments to the thunk.  The thunk previously took 2 arguments: localsToInit and
        canBeOptimized.  localsToInit is now computed in the thunk at runtime, and
        canBeOptimized is used as a specialization argument to generate 2 variants of the
        op_enter thunk: op_enter_canBeOptimized_Generator and op_enter_cannotBeOptimized_Generator,
        thereby removing the need to pass it as a runtime argument.

           BaselineJIT: 93319628 (88.996532 MB)   => 83851824 (79.967331 MB)   0.90x

        Optimize compareStrictEq when neither side is a double and at least one is neither a string nor a BigInt
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226676

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        There is exactly one case where x === y must return false despite x and y being JSValues with the same bits:
            NaN === NaN
        There are a few cases where x === y must return true despite x and y being JSValues with potentially different bits:
            Double === Int32
            String === String
            HeapBigInt === HeapBigInt
            HeapBigInt === BigInt32 (if they are enabled)
        If we don't have a double on either side, at least one side has neither a String nor a HeapBigInt, and BigInt32 are disabled, we can clearly ignore all of these pathological cases.

        This optimization was decided based on looking at DFG graphs of Speedometer2; here is a sample of the compareStrictEq(Untyped, Untyped), courtesy of Phil:
            Final|Array|String|Bool, Final|Array|String|Bool
            Array|String|Bool, String|Bool (twice)
            Array|String|Bool, String|Int32 (once in DFG, once in FTL)
        !   Array|String|Bool, Array|Bool
        !   Final|Other, Final|Other
        !   Int32|Other, Int32
            Final|StringIdent, Final|StringIdent (3 times)
            Final|StringIdent|BoolInt32, StringIdent|BoolInt32 (twice)
            String|Bool, String|Bool (4 times)
            DoublePureNaN, String|Bool
        !   Other, Function|Other
        !   Final|Other, Final|Function|Other (twice)
            Final|String|Bool|Other, Final|String|Bool|Other (3 times, two in the FTL)
            Final|String|Int32, String|Int32 (four times)
            String|Int32|Bool, Function|String|Int32|Bool (twice)
            String|DoublePureNaN, String|Bool (twice)
        !   Final|Bool|Other, Final|Function|Other (four times, twice in FTL)
        I marked with a ! those for which this optimization should apply.

        The only slightly interesting part of this patch is DFG::SpeculativeJIT::speculateNeitherDoubleNorHeapBigIntNorString where I took care to skip every test whose result we can predict from the abstract interpreter.

        fall back to the domain's `"targetTypes"`, which includes ITML.

        Drop the FTL(DFG) graph after lowering to B3
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226556

        Reviewed by Phil Pizlo.

        The challenge in this patch was dealing with all of the Patchpoints created by FTLLowerDFGToB3: they get a lambda at that time, which they execute at the end of Air, and many of these lambdas were capturing a pointer to some parts of the DFG graph and reading through it when being executed.
        In all cases but one it was easily fixed: they were only reading a few bits from a given node, so I just read these bits in FTLLowerDFGToB3, and captured them (by value) instead of the pointer to the node.
        The exception was compileCallOrConstructVarargsSpread(): its patchpoint generator was walking through the graph, flattening a tree of PhantomSpread/PhantomNewArrayWithSpread/PhantomNewArrayBuffer/PhantomCreateRest, emitting some code along the way.
        We now do this flattening of the tree in FTLLowerDFGToB3, store just enough information to later emit the required code in a vector, and capture that vector in the lambda (through a move capture, which is allowed since C++14). See `struct VarargsSpreadArgumentToEmit` for the information that we need to store in that vector.

        I tested this change by completing a full run of JetStream2 with ASAN.
        I also ran the stress tests with "spread" in their name in Debug mode.

        Optimize Function.prototype.toString
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226418
        <rdar://77861846>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Add caching to Function.prototype.toString. This is used heavily in Speedometer2, and repeatedly recomputing a
        string which is a constant is costly. We cache the results of toString in all cases except for bound functions.
        To make this work for bound functions, we'd need to add a new field they can use for this cache. For other
        functions, we cache it on the executable (either NativeExecutable or FunctionExecutable). The reason we can't
        do this on the executable for bound functions is that all bound functions share the same executable, but
        individual bound functions can have different names. The reason it's valid to cache the results in general is that a
        function's name field can't be changed from JS code -- it's non-writable.

        This patch also makes Function.prototype.toString an intrinsic in the DFG/FTL. We emit code on the fast path
        which reads the cached value if it's present. If not, we call into the slow path, which will compute
        the cached value for non bound functions, or compute the result for bound functions.

        I added a new microbenchmark that speeds up by >35x:

        function-to-string     2197.5952+-30.7118    ^     59.9861+-2.5550        ^ definitely 36.6350x faster

        [JSC] Implement JIT ICs for InByVal
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226563

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Until now, InByVal has had few optimizations implemented:
        DFG would attempt to convert string index lookups to InById and int32 lookups to HasIndexedProperty,
        but there has been no inline caching nor any special handling for symbol lookups.

        This has become a more urgent problem now, as `#x in obj` (i.e. HasPrivateName / HasPrivateBrand)
        will need to mimic InByVal's inline caching strategy in order to be deemed performant enough to ship.

        This patch thus implements inline caching for InByVal at all JIT tiers.
        The result is a night-and-day difference for symbols, a nice boost for string indices, and no change for int32s: 

        in-by-val-symbol                  203.5572+-2.7647     ^     19.1035+-0.7498        ^ definitely 10.6555x faster
        in-by-val-string-index             87.0368+-44.7766          45.9971+-32.0007         might be 1.8922x faster

        - PutByOffset doesn't GC! So let's not say that it does.

        - The store barrier clustering phase is no longer called the store barrier fencing phase in

        Web Inspector: [Cocoa] `RemoteInspector` won't connect to a new relay if it hasn't yet failed to communicate with a previously connected relay
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226539

        Reviewed by Devin Rousso.

        `RemoteInspector` communicates with a relay daemon running on the same device in order to send updates like new
        or removed inspectable targets and receive changes to settings like automatic debugging. The relay daemon then
        communicates with a client that connects for debugging. Only one relay daemon should ever be running at a time,
        and its lifecycle is managed separately from JavaScriptCore.

        RemoteInspector holds a RefPtr to its connection to this relay, and only clears this pointer upon a failure to
        communicate over the XPC connection or a known disconnection. However, it is possible, and in some cases likely
        (for example the relay restarting from a brief client disconnection and reconnection), that we can be informed
        of a newly launched relay being available while still thinking we are connected to the old relay, as we have not 
        yet sent a message and triggered a failure in the interim period of time.

        To correct this we now send a simple message any time `setupXPCConnectionIfNeeded` is called if we have an
        existing RefPtr to a relay connection in order to verify the connection is still functional. We now also retry
        to connect to a relay upon failure in order to create a new connection to the current relay.

        In order to prevent entering a retry loop where every subsequent retry's failure results in another retry
        forever, a flag to retry connecting is set when a call to setupXPCConnectionIfNeeded is made while we already
        have a RefPtr to a relay connection. On failure if we are in this special state we will retry once to connect
        but subsequent failures will not automatically reattempt a connection.

        sure the connection is either still valid or is torn down properly on failure.

        - If the retry flag is set, schedule a retry and clear the retry flag.

        B3MoveConstants should filter directly on Values, and only create ValueKeys when useful
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226420

        Reviewed by Phil Pizlo.

        I did a few runs of JetStream2 to measure results, the time spent in B3MoveConstants goes from 160-180ms to 100-110ms.
        The total time spent in B3+Air is in the 6 to 8s range, so this is approximately a 1% speedup.

        Merge B3::StackSlot and Air::StackSlot
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226362

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This is a very simple and safe (although small) memory saving, since every B3StackSlot eventually becomes an AirStackSlot with an exact copy of all the same information.
        Simply dropping the B3StackSlot past that point is tricky, because one of them might be retained by FTLState (and modified by Air).
        It is much simpler to just use Air::StackSlot throughout. It saves us:
        - 16 bytes per B3StackSlot (for the structure itself)
        - another 8 bytes per B3StackSlot (for the pointer in the SparseCollection)
        - 8 bytes per AirStackSlot (for the pointer to the B3::StackSlot)
        I also took the opportunity to save an extra 8 bytes per AirStackSlot, by shrinking the bytesize field to a uint16_t (with a RELEASE_ASSERT that we never overflow it) and moving the StackSlotKind in the hole this creates.
        Total savings: 16 bytes per spill slot and 40 bytes per locked (by B3) slot.

        We should drop B3 values while running Air
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226187

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We must keep the following values:
        - WasmBoundsCheck, to know whether it is Pinned or Maximum, and if it is pinned find its argument.
        - CCall/Patch/Check/CheckAdd/CheckSub/CheckMul and all of their children, because all of these are lowered to Air::Patchpoint, which needs to know the type of its arguments, and does so by looking at the children of its        origin.
        I intend to fix these in later patches if possible.

        Finally we must preserve all B3 values in the following cases:
        - if we dump the disassembly or the Air graph: because otherwise we cannot print the origins
        - if we are using the sampling profiler, because it relies on PCToCodeOriginMap which we cannot accurately fill without these origins.

        We must also keep m_tuples alive, as it is used by Patchpoints in Air to understand the types of their arguments.
        We also don't touch StackSlots (in this patch), because one of them is captured by FTL::State.

        Also now PCToOriginMap has a Vector with no inline capacity, since it is either quite large (if needed) or empty (otherwise).

        The performance impact of this is a progression on various RAMification subtests on Mac, but is more mitigated on iPhone7, with various regressions.
        I suspect these to be noise, and will monitor the performance bots post-landing to make sure of it.

        Convert small JIT pool tests into executable fuzzing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226279

        Right now, we try to test our engine on a small JIT pool. This isn't a known configuration for any
        actual ports and causes issues if we run out of JIT memory when we need to compile an OSR exit.
        Instead of testing such a small pool we should just fuzz each executable allocation that says it
        can fail.

        The current fuzzing doesn't do a good job tracking the number of DFG/FTL compiles when allocations
        fail, so when enabled those tests will just exit early. Also, right now we use a random seed picked
        by the engine for these tests, which makes it hard to reproduce crashes on the bots. If we see
        flakiness on the bots we can have the harness pass in a number so it gets logged in the repro command.

        DFG OSR exit isn't set up to allow materializing phantom arguments objects

        We don't analyze any locals when reconstructing the variable event stream
        if that local is past the extent of the inline call frame.
        
        This patch makes it so we treat it as an escape if between the definition and
        the last use of a sink candidate (either via an IR use or bytecode liveness)

        AirAllocateStackByGraphColoring should use the optimized interference graphs from AirAllocateRegistersByGraphColoring
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226258

        Reviewed by Phil Pizlo.

        The main change in this patch is that AirAllocateStackByGraphColoring is now using the optimized datastructures in wtf/InterferenceGraph.h.
        This required templating most of it over the interference graph used (Small/Large/Huge), but I tried keeping some common parts out of the templated class to minimize the impact on compile times and binary size.

        A consequence of that change is that coalescableMoves and remappedStackSlots now store indices instead of direct pointers to StackSlots, resulting in a memory reduction of about 3x as well.

        Another consequence is that I had to slightly alter the way that coalescing works: instead of carefully removing the interference edges of the killed slot, we simply use mayClear() which is not guaranteed to remove anything.
        I believe that this is sound, because every subsequent access to m_interference checks whether a slot has been coalesced first, so dropping these edges is purely a memory saving, but has no logical effect.

        The new code was tested in a few ways:
        - running on JetStream2 with asan
        - running on JetStream2 with TEST_OPTIMIZED_INTERFERENCE_GRAPH
        - running on JetStream2 and logging the frame sizes at the end of this phase, and comparing to the results of doing the same on ToT (same average frame size)

        The two functions where this code had the largest memory footprint in JetStream2 were both in tsf-wasm.
        One has 751 stack slots, and had an interference graph of 2.1MB and a coalescableMoves vector of 440kB
        The other has 673 stack slots, and had an interference graph of 1.9MB and a coalescableMoves vector of 421kB.
        With this patch, they respectively use 79kB+146kB and 67kB+140kB
        The effect on the rest of JetStream2 is less likely to matter as few functions used more than a few dozens of kB in this phase, but in percentages are just as huge.

        More importantly (and the reason I wrote this patch in the first place), I checked mruby-wasm.aotoki.dev which with a few other pages forced us to lower Options::maximumTmpsForGraphColoring because of jetsams.
        It has two massive functions that reach this phase if I increase Options::maximumTmpsForGraphColoring:
        - about 6k stack slots -> 215MB + 6MB (interference graph + coalescableMoves)
        - about 9k stack slots -> 395MB + 4MB
        After this patch, they respectively use 4.5MB+2MB and 9MB+1.5MB, or roughly a 40x improvement.
        Combined with the recent improvements to the register allocator, I hope to be able to increase Options::maximumTmpsForGraphColoring soon (in a different patch for easier bisection if either cause a perf regression).
        This would be helpful, since its lowering cratered our performance on some other wasm application by 8x.

        In terms of compile times, this patch lowered the time spent in AllocateStackByGraphColoring over the course of a run of JetStream2 from roughly 350ms to roughly 270ms.
        This is almost certainly negligible, but at least it guarantees that it did not regress.

        Merge all the JIT worklists into a shared worklist
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226207

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Delete the DFG and FTL worklists and refactor JITWorklist to handle the compilation
        for all tiers. This reduces the total number of compiler threads while allowing each
        tier to use more threads whenever necessary. The default configuration is for the
        worklist to have 3 threads, baseline can use up to all 3 threads and DFG and FTL follow
        the previous limits set through JSC::Options. Right now, the worklist will only do work
        on upper tiers when all lower tiers have no pending tasks or have exceeded the maximum
        number of concurrent compilations. i.e. by default we only DFG compile when there are
        no baseline tasks in the queue and we only FTL compile when we either have no DFG tasks
        in the queue OR there are already 2 DFG compilations in progress.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We make this work by tracking if we're a compiler thread when generating
        the CTI stub. If so, it means that the main thread needs to issue a
        crossModifyingCodeFence when it's going to run the CTI stub for the first
        time.
        
        This patch also does away with pre-generating thunks. Thunks can now generate
        other thunks while they're running. To do this, we make JITThunks lock a
        recursive lock. The reason this is ok is that we don't have any recursive
        thunks in the thunk graph. It's a DAG.

        Make CheckedLock the default Lock
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226157

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Make CheckedLock the default Lock so that we get more benefits from Clang
        Thread Safety Analysis. Note that CheckedLock 100% relies on the existing
        Lock implementation and merely adds the clang anotations for thread 
        safety.

        That this patch does is:
        1. Rename the Lock class to UncheckedLock
        2. Rename the CheckedLock class to Lock
        3. Rename the Condition class to UncheckedCondition
        4. Rename the CheckedCondition class to Condition
        5. Update the types of certain variables from Lock / Condition to
           UncheckedLock / UncheckedCondition if I got a build failure. Build 
           failures are usually caused by the following facts:
           - Locker<CheckedLock> doesn't subclass AbstractLocker which a lot of
             JSC code passes as argument
           - Locker<CheckedLock> has no move constructor
           - Locker<CheckedLock> cannot be constructed from a lock pointer, only
             a reference

        For now, CheckedLock and CheckedCondition remain as aliases to Lock and 
        Condition, in their respective CheckedLock.h / CheckedCondition.h headers.
        I will drop them in a follow-up to reduce patch size.

        I will also follow-up to try and get rid of as much usage of UncheckedLock
        and UncheckedCondition as possible. I did not try very hard in this patch
        to reduce patch size.

        Change virtualThunkFor() to return 1 of 6 possible singleton thunks.
        These thunks are cached via vm.jitStubs->ctiStubs().

        This change saves us ~16M of executable JIT memory (for the unique thunks) on a
        single run of Speedometer2.  On an M1 Mac, switching to singleton thunks here also
        appears to be a 1.012x speed up on Speedometer2.  Performance is neutral on
        JetStream2.

        Support Ergonomic Brand Checks proposal (`#x in obj`)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221093

        Reviewed by Caio Araujo Neponoceno de Lima.

        This patch implements the following Stage 3 proposal (behind a runtime option):
        https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-fields-in-in

        Specifically, it extends the `in` keyword to allow the LHS to be a private name,
        thereby allowing users to implement Array.isArray-esque brand checks for their own classes
        *without* having to wrap a private member get in a try-catch.

        For example:
        ```
        class C {
            #x;
            static isC(obj) { return #x in obj; }
        }
        ```

        This is done by adding two new bytecode ops, HasPrivateName and HasPrivateBrand. For the moment,
        these are implemented without fast paths, as we should do so for InByVal first and then have these follow suit.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Remove WTF::holdLock() / WTF::holdLockIf() because they are not compatible with
        Clang Thread Safety Analysis. All call sites have been converted to use the Locker
        constructor directly.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Replace LockHolder with Locker in local variables. It is shorter and it allows switching the lock
        type more easily since the compiler with deduce the lock type T for Locker<T>.

        Stop using holdLock() in JSC as it is not compatible with Clang thread safety analysis
        (WTF::CheckedLock). Use the Locker constructor instead.

        I'll eventually get rid of the holdLock() definition once I have managed to get rid of
        all its usages.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch is fixing some fallout from moving JIT::link() to a background
        thread:
        1. We can't shrink the CodeBlock's constant pool on a background thread
        since we read from it without grabbing a lock on the main thread (when
        reading things off the stack in slow path calls).
        2. We can't create GCAwareJITStubRoutines on the compilation thread, since
        creating a GCAwareJITStubRoutines adds to a global hash table inside Heap. This
        means that we have to do that step of emitting virtual calls for eval when
        we're finalizing code on the main thread.
        
        This patch also makes it so that a baseline JIT compilation thread is
        correctly marked as such.

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        This patch makes it so that Polymorphic stubs don't repatch when using
        Data Call ICs. We add a branch to the Data IC fast path to see if we're
        polymorphic. If we are, then we either call or tail call the polymorphic
        stub, depending on the CallLinkInfo's call type. This patch also changes
        the polymorphic stub to handle being called instead of jumped to, since that
        will now happen for Data ICs of non tail calls.

        Ripping out broken Baseline JIT rare case profiling.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Robin Morisset.

        The profiling has been broken in recent times.  Fixing it to work does not appear
        to improve performance.  Ripping out the profiling appears to not hurt performance.
        However, ripping out the profiling appears to save on code size generated for the
        Baseline JIT.

        Speed up debug validation in CacheableIdentifier::createFromIdentifierOwnedByCodeBlock().

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        1. Introduce CodeBlock::hasIdentifier() so that we can encapsulate the identifier
           search better.  Change CacheableIdentifier::createFromIdentifierOwnedByCodeBlock()
           to call this method instead of rolling its own identifier search.

        2. If the CodeBlock is pathological and has a ridiculous number of identifiers
           to search, create a cached hash set of the identifiers, and use that for
           doing the search instead.

           Apparently, YouTube can have a single JS function with 2177689 bytecodes, where
           a large portion of those are put_by_ids.  The function also has some 17k+
           identifiers.  With that may bytecodes doing a validation search on 17k+
           identifiers in a Debug build, the site can become un-useable.  This optimization
           brings it back from un-useable to barely tolerable on the Debug build.

        3. Also fetch the UnlinkedCodeBlock from the WriteBarrier field just once in
           CodeBlock::identifier() and CodeBlock::hasIdentifier().  This may not matter
           on a Release build, but it can add up on a Debug build, which is already slow.
           We should try to avoid doing redundant validation via the WriteBarrier access.

        Make AirAllocateRegistersByGraphColoring use less memory
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225848

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        We've had some jetsam problems caused by the main Air register allocator, which caused us to lower Options::maximumTmpsForGraphColoring.
        Hence this patch tries to improve the memory usage of the allocator. It includes several changes:
        - Change the datastructure used for representing the interference graph. Before it was effectively a HashSet<std::pair<uint16_t, uint16_t>. Now, it is either a Bitvector (for n < 400 for now, can be tweaked easily), or a Vector<LikelyDenseUnsignedIntegerSet<uint16_t>> otherwise.
        LikelyDenseUnsignedIntegerSet is a new datastructure introduced by this patch, it is either a HashSet if very sparse, or a BitVector + an amount to shift it by.
        This is by far the largest memory reduction in this patch, it reduces the maximum memory used for an interference graph in tsf-wasm in JetStream2 from 16MB to 700kB, and in mruby-wasm.aotoki.dev from 262MB to 20MB (the later only happen when we increase Options::maximumTmpsForGraphColoring.. this is the exact function which caused us to lower it).
        Its effect on smaller functions in JetStream2 is rarely as dramatic but always an improvement, and improvements between 2x and 5x are extremely common (10x to 30x are significantly rarer but do occur).
        - In order to easily test this change and any further change to this datastructure, the old approach was preserved as InterferenceHashSet, and a template to run two such datastructures in parallel, checking their equivalence was added: InstrumentedInterferenceGraph. Running with it and reportInterferenceGraphMemoryUse set to true was used to compute the numbers given above.
        - There was already some template parameter to change the size of the tmp indices from unsigned to uint16_t but the code failed to compile unless it was unsigned. I fixed this, made more consistent use of it, and switched to uint16_t in the very common case that we have less than 65k Tmps (we can have more despite the option because of spilling). This halved the memory usage of various other datastructures in the register allocator
        - unspillableTmps was a HashSet<unsigned>. Since it is often quite dense (often around 20% on JetStream2), I replaced it by a Bitvector instead
        - m_biases was a HashMap<IndexType, HashSet<IndexType>>. Since it is extremely rare that the sets have more than 8 elements (from looking at some instrumented run of JetStream2), I replaced it by HashMap<IndexType, SmallSet<IndexType>>. This not only significantly reduces memory, but nearly halves the time spent in assignColors(around 80ms -> 40ms in JetStream 2)
        - UseCounts was needlessly general: it is only used by the register allocator (all other references to UseCounts refer to the completely different B3::UseCounts), so there is no point in it computing, and then storing lots of irrelevant data. A float is also more than enough precision (especially since it is pretty much always 1, 10, 100, or 1000 in practice…). Also, since we only need it indexed by Tmps, we can use a Vector with AbsoluteTmpMapper instead of its HashMap. These changes are not just memory savings, they also make selectSpill way faster (570ms -> 250ms on my machine on JetStream2)
        - While I was at it, I did a couple of other tweaks to the logic of selectSpill. In particular, instead of having to check for isFastTmp every time, I just put the fast tmps directly in unspillableTmps, which prevents them from getting added to m_spillWorklist in the first place. This + a bit of clean-up (for example putting an early exit instead of setting score to infinity in the case of dead tmps) resulted in a further perf win (to roughly 200ms spent in selectSpill() on JetStream2)

        All together, this patch reduces the time spent in the register allocator by roughly 15 to 20% in JetStream2 (tested both with the Briggs and the IRC allocators on my MBP 2019).

        I do not yet have precise performance numbers for this exact patch, but benchmarking a previous version of it (with a less optimized interference graph) resulted in significant RAMification improvements (around 1%), and more surprisingly some JetStream2 improvements on weaker machines (e.g. an iPhone 7 gained > 1%). I believe these gains come either from less trashing of the caches, or less contention caused by the memory traffic.
        I will try to update the bugzilla with more up-to-date thorough results when I get them.

        This patch does not increase Options::maximumTmpsForGraphColoring, I intend to do that in a separate patch to make it easier to revert in case of a problem.

        Add Data Call ICs that don't repatch and use them in the baseline JIT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225321
        <rdar://problem/77773796>

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        This patch adds Data ICs for calls. Data ICs for calls work by loading a code 
        pointer from CallLinkInfo, and indirect calling that pointer. This means that
        to repatch such an IC, all we need to do is replace a code pointer inside
        CallLinkInfo. No need to repatch the JIT code.
        
        The current implementation only does this for monomorphic calls. We still
        repatch the JIT code for polymorphic calls. In a followup, we will also
        opt polymorphic call ICs into data-based calls:
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225793
        
        This patch only uses Data Call ICs for the Baseline JIT. Even with that, it
        reduces the number of calls to cacheFlush by ~45% on JetStream2.
        
        Performance is neutral on AS Macs, but it paves the way towards doing
        unlinked JITting in JSC.

        This patch loosens `function.caller` to allow non-strict getters, setters, arrow functions,
        and ES6 methods to be returned as callers, fixing web compatibility.

        The intent of r230662 is preserved: generator / async functions are never exposed. There is
        no good way to acquire wrapper function from the internal body one, nor from its arguments.
        Also, this behavior is on standards track [1] (seems to be considered desirable).

        Implement baseline op_enter, op_ret, op_check_traps, op_throw using JIT thunks.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225846

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        op_enter, op_ret, op_check_traps are 3 of the most common opcodes.  Throwing in
        op_throw because it's easy.

        In this patch, the following changes were also made:

        1. Renamed copyCalleeSavesFromFrameOrRegisterToEntryFrameCalleeSavesBuffer() to
           copyLLIntBaselineCalleeSavesFromFrameOrRegisterToEntryFrameCalleeSavesBuffer().

           It is only used by the baseline JIT.  Changed it to always operate on
           RegisterAtOffsetList::llintBaselineCalleeSaveRegisters().  This removes the
           dependency on a current codeBlock being compiled, and allows us to use it
           for a JIT thunk.

        2. Added JIT::emitNakedNearJump() to make it easy to emit direct jumps to JIT thunks.

           Currently, it is only used by op_ret and op_throw.

        3. Changed some thunks to use emitNonPatchableExceptionCheck() instead
           emitExceptionCheck() to make it explicit that these are not intended to be
           patchable.

        With this patch, --dumpLinkBufferStats shows the following changes in emitted

        IsoAlignedMemoryAllocator should use BitVector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225852

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Right now IsoAlignedMemoryAllocator uses FastBitVector, which does
        not have inline storage for small sizes. However, it's not
        uncommon for IsoAlignedMemoryAllocator to be holding onto only a
        few blocks. Those blocks may exist for a long time, which some
        data indicates causes IsoAlignedMemoryAllocator's FastBitVector to
        pin a full physical page for one 8 byte allocation. Since
        accessing the commited blocks list is not a particularly hot
        operation, we should just use a BitVector instead.

        This seems to be perf neutral on benchmarks.

        DFGVarargsForwardingPhase shouldn't consult Flush
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225824

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo and Yusuke Suzuki.

        In the Varargs Forwarding Phase, we were treating Flush as if it
        were any other form of node that interferes with an argument
        via clobbering a stack location.
        
        This isn't how Flush works though. It doesn't have execution
        semantics at the node's graph location. Instead, Flush means that
        any variable it's linked to in CPS should be flushed to the stack
        between it and the Flush.
        
        The semantics of arguments is that they're already flushed to the
        stack, and they've always been. Seeing a Flush node doesn't prevent
        arguments elimination, we already know the arguments are on the stack,
        and all we're searching for is if there is an interference operation
        that says it'll clobber that stack slot. Flush isn't an interference operation.
        
        This is a 0.5% Speedometer progression.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki and Saam Barati.

        This patch applies the following strategy to Baseline JIT property access slow paths:

        1. If the slow path operation call is not patchable, emit a near call to a JIT
           thunk to do the entire operation call.

        2. If the slow path operation call is patachable, emit a near call to a prepare
           call JIT thunk before the patchable operation call, and a near call to an exception
           check JIT thunk after.

        This strategy reduces the amount of instructions emitted for all the slow paths.
        Performance is expected to be neutral or slightly improved due to the reduced
        compile times and better cache locality.

        Implement some common Baseline JIT slow paths using JIT thunks.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225682

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch implements the following changes:

        1. Implement exception handling thunks:
           a. handleExceptionGenerator, which calls operationLookupExceptionHandler().
           b. handleExceptionWithCallFrameRollbackGenerator, which calls
              operationLookupExceptionHandlerFromCallerFrame().

           All the JIT tiers were emitting their own copy of these routines to call these
           operation, one per CodeBlock.  We now emit 2 thunks for these and have all the
           tiers just jump to them.

           PolymorphicAccess also now uses the handleExceptionGenerator thunk.

           DFG::JITCompiler::compileExceptionHandlers() has one small behavior difference
           before it calls operationLookupExceptionHandlerFromCallerFrame(): it first
           re-sets the top of stack for the function where we are about to throw a
           StackOverflowError from.  This re-setting of top of stack is useless because
           we're imminently unwinding out of at least this frame for the StackOverflowError.
           Hence, it is ok to use the handleExceptionWithCallFrameRollbackGenerator thunk
           here as well.  Note that no other tiers does this re-setting of top of stack.

           FTLLowerDFGToB3 has one case using operationLookupExceptionHandlerFromCallerFrame()
           which cannot be refactored to use these thunks because it does additional
           work to throw a StackOverflowError.  A different thunk will be needed.  I left
           it alone for now.

        2. Introduce JITThunks::existingCTIStub(ThunkGenerator, NoLockingNecessaryTag) so
           that a thunk can get a pointer to another thunk without locking the JITThunks
           lock.  Otherwise, deadlock ensues.

        3. Change SlowPathCall to emit and use thunks instead of emitting a blob of code
           to call a slow path function for every bytecode in a CodeBlock.

        4. Introduce JITThunks::ctiSlowPathFunctionStub() to manage these SlowPathFunction
           thunks.

        5. Introduce JITThunks::preinitializeAggressiveCTIThunks() to initialize these
           thunks at VM initialization time.  Pre-initializing them has multiple benefits:
           a. the thunks are not scattered through out JIT memory, thereby reducing
              fragmentation.
           b. we don't spend time at runtime compiling them when the user is interacting
              with the VM.  Conceptually, these thunks can be VM independent and can be
              shared by VMs process-wide.  However, it will require some additional work.
              For now, the thunks remain bound to a specific VM instance.

        These changes are only enabled when ENABLE(EXTRA_CTI_THUNKS), which is currently
        only available for ARM64 and non-Windows x86_64.

        Using 4 GC markers (which really means 3 parallel GC worker threads -- the mutator thread is

        Add support to collect stats on cumulative LinkBuffer linked sizes based on profiles.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225617

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        There are 2 ways to dump the stats:
        1. Specify --dumpLinkBufferStats as an argument to the jsc shell.
        2. Call $vm.dumpLinkBufferStats() from your JS script to get the stats as a string.
           e.g.
                $vm.print($vm.dumpLinkBufferStats());

        Here's an example of what the dump looks like:

            Cummulative LinkBuffer profile sizes:

        [JSC] Fix invalid exception checks after recent ErrorInstance changes

        Of particular note:
        The earlier patch sought to consolidate Error#cause logic under ErrorInstance::finishCreation.
        This part must be undone as it is crucial that non-user-thrown errors be able to bypass that logic

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225535

        Reviewed by Alexey Shvayka.

        Error#cause is specified such that `new Error(message, {})` and `new Error(message, { cause: undefined })`
        are not the same -- namely, the latter should create a property descriptor with an undefined `value`.

        This would seem absurd, but the reason is because the `cause` field is meant to store a thrown object,
        and `throw undefined;` is valid code.

        In aligning our implementation with the spec, this patch also consolidates the relevant logic in one place
        (ErrorInstance::finishCreation) to minimize confusion.

        We also used loadLoadFence in some places where I couldn't think of any good reason for the

        1. Enhance JITStubRoutineSet::deleteUnmarkedJettisonedStubRoutines() to be able to

        2. Added JITStubRoutineSet::notifyHaveRoutinesToDelete() so that
           GCAwareJITStubRoutine::observeZeroRefCount() can flag that the GC may have
           some dead GCAwareJITStubRoutines to delete.

        3. Added JITStubRoutineSet::mayHaveRoutinesToDelete() so that clients can do

           calling JITStubRoutineSet::deleteUnmarkedJettisonedStubRoutines() altogether
           if not needed.

        4. Added Heap::mayHaveJITStubRoutinesToDelete() and Heap::deleteDeadJITStubRoutines()
           as wrappers around JITStubRoutineSet::mayHaveRoutinesToDelete() and
           JITStubRoutineSet::deleteUnmarkedJettisonedStubRoutines() because the use of
           the JITStubRoutineSet is a heap internal implementation detail.

        5. Enhanced the IncrementalSweeper to also call Heap::deleteDeadJITStubRoutines()
           if needed.

        6. Enhanced Heap::sweepSynchronously() to also call Heap::deleteDeadJITStubRoutines()
           if needed.

        7. Time slices for Heap::deleteDeadJITStubRoutines() is currently set at the
           current values:
           a. max of 1 ms (1/10 of the IncreamentalSweeper's time slice) when invoked from
              the IncreamentalSweeper.
           b. max of 5 ms when invoked from Heap::deleteUnmarkedCompiledCode().
           c. unlimited time (with a sanity check) when called from Heap::sweepSynchronously().

           The choices of 1ms and 5ms were picked to not be too long, but would still delete
           the bulk of the dead GCAwareJITStubRoutines quickly enough based on data from my
           instrumented runs the CLI version of JetStream2.

           I think these hardcoded values will do for now.  If need be, we can try something
           more sophisticated later.

        Fix syntax error message for AUTOPLUSPLUS token.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        For the record, it's not easy to tell from the code why AUTOPLUSPLUS is needed.
        It's needed to distinguish this:
            ```
            statement ++ stuff  // ++ is a postfix operator applied to `statement`.
            ```
        from this:
            ```
            statement
            ++stuff    // The `\n` before the ++ makes it a prefix operator applied to `stuff``.
            ```

        If we merely tokenize the ++ as a PLUSPLUS token, then it's unclear whether it acts
        as a postfix or prefix token in the 2nd case above.

        This is why the correct fix is not to get rid of the AUTOPLUSPLUS token, but to
        teach the syntax error message to be aware of the AUTOPLUSPLUS token.

        If we ask for a JIT pool that is smaller than the smallest possible "region" (thing with jump
        island) that we can create -- i.e. smaller than a jump region, then assume that the user is
        asking us to create a pool that has that much usable space plus a jump region.

        I think that this makes the option easier to use when you're testing ridiculously small JIT
        pools, which we happen to do in our test suite.

        samples taken for ~7 seconds of code running time. It's worth figuring out

        This patch also fixes a bug where we mis-attribute JITTypes for inline

        of using the machine frame's JITType.

        rdar://76694909

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        Some pre-existing functions assertNoException() or releaseAssertNoException().
        These assertion may not be valid anymore in light of the TerminationException, and
        require some fix up:

        1. If it makes sense to convert the assertion into an exception check, then do so.

           For example, see objectPrototypeToString(), slow_path_create_this().

        2. If the assertion is at the end of a function just before it returns, or if the
           remaining code in the function will not be affected by the pending exception,
           then we can replace the assertion as follows:

               assertNoException() => assertNoExceptionExceptTermination()
               releaseAssertNoException() => releaseAssertNoExceptionExceptTermination()

           For example, see objectPrototypeHasOwnProperty(), JSObject::getOwnNonIndexPropertyNames().

        3. If the assertion is in a function where perf is not absolutely critical, and the
           function isn't calling any other functions that will re-enter the VM or potentially
           get stuck in an infinite loop, then we can use a DeferTermination scope to defer
           termination.

           For example, see Debugger::pauseIfNeeded(), SamplingProfiler::StackFrame::nameFromCallee().

        4. If the assertion is in an initializer function is only run once and adding
           exception checks would complicate the code more than it's worth (an engineering
           judgement), then use a DeferTermination scope.

           For example, see ProgramExecutable::initializeGlobalProperties(), setupAdaptiveWatchpoint().

           Some leaf (or near-leaf) functions that currently DECLARE_CATCH_SCOPE() may also
           fall under this category.

           For example, see JSFunction::prototypeForConstruction().

        [JSC] Remove defaultValue() from the method table
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225032

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch not only removes the unnecessary method table entry, but also makes
        the presence of custom ToPrimitive behavior observable to userland code.

        To maintain object identity and (possibly) enable caching, Symbol.toPrimitive
        method is stored on a structure. To avoid any potential breakage, it's made
        replaceable and configurable, covering the case when its holder is a [[ProxyTarget]].

        For JSCallbackObject, Symbol.toPrimitive method is created only if ConvertToType
        callback is present, before initialization is performed.

        Also, this change adds additional ordinaryToPrimitive() cast to fix the invariant
        that toPrimitive() returns a primitive value, which was broken if ConvertToType
        callback returned an object. The invariant is enforced by the spec [1][2] and is
        validated via assertion in JSValue::toStringSlowCase().

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        All of the various CodeBlock classes currently have the
        numCalleeLocals and numVars marked as ints. I believe this is just
        a historical artifact or because VirtualRegister's offset is an
        int to make handling constants easier. Regardless, it's a bit
        strange to not handle the sign conversion at the point of
        comparison between a VirtualRegister offset and the local/var
        count. This doesn't completely fix every place we use ints for
        these values but starts on the right track. Lastly, I also added
        some Check<unsigned>s to the wasm parser for sanity checking.

        [JSC] OrdinarySet should invoke custom [[Set]] methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217916

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch fixes putInlineSlow() to handle special properties (like JSFunction's "name"
        and JSArray's "length") in prototype chain. When such property is encountered, prototype
        chain traversal is stopped; if it's read-only, a TypeError is thrown in strict mode.

        This change adds OverridesPut out of line type info flag, and utilizes it in putInlineSlow()
        to invoke overriden methods. While this approach requires put() methods to be aware of
        altered receivers, it renders several benefits:
          1. put() method can be used for both "real" [[Set]] overrides and special properties,
             with its return value remaining `bool`;
          2. it is simpler, faster, and more predictable than calling [[GetOwnProperty]] in
             putInlineSlow() or adding defineOwnPropertyViaPut() to the method table.

        Removes ordinarySetSlow() for non-index properties, which didn't invoke some [[Set]]
        methods as well. Instead, definePropertyOnReceiver() is introduced for altered receivers,
        which performs correctly when reached because:
          1. all special properties were already handled (unless it's Reflect.set);
          2. performing putDirectInternal() is unobservable (unless ProxyObject was seen);
          3. putDirectInternal() now fully implements property definition of OrdinarySet [1];
          4. put() override is required if a spec defines custom [[DefineOwnProperty]].

        Since indexed puts handle overrides / altered receivers quite differently, they will
        be fixed in a follow-up, completely removing ordinarySetSlow().

        Also, by merging putEntry() / putToPrimitive() into putInlineSlow() and introducing
        putInlineFastReplacingStaticPropertyIfNeeded() helper, this patch fixes a few bugs:
          1. Direct [[Set]] to non-reified static property now preserves its attributes when replacing [[Value]].
          2. Prototype chain [[Set]] to non-reified static property now throws if receiver is non-extensible.
          3. Non-reified static writable property now shadows read-only one that is further in prototype chain.
          4. Non-reified static properties in prototype chain of a primitive are now considered.

        Fixes a few issues that were previously unobservable:
          1. PropertyAttribute::CustomValue is now unset when a setter-less property is reassigned.
          2. uint64_t putByIndexInline() now calls put() via method table like uint32_t counterpart.

        Other notable refactors:
          1. Inlines callCustomSetter(), dropping weird TriState return value.
          2. Simplifies initialization of StringPrototype.
          3. Simplifies isThisValueAltered() to pointer comparisons at non-JSProxy call sites.
          4. Removes doPutPropertySecurityCheck() methods as the same checks are performed by put() methods.
          5. Removes prototypeChainMayInterceptStoreTo(), which pretty much duplicated canPerformFastPutInline().
          6. Removes dummy JSArrayBufferView::put() method.
          7. Removes now unused lookupPut().

        Aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        This patch carefully preserves the current behavior of Reflect.set with CustomValue
        and prototype chain [[Set]] to a JSCallbackObject / legacy platform object.

        This change is performance-neutral on /put/ microbenchmarks as it doesn't affect
        caching, only the slow path. Reflect.set with JSFinalObject receiver is 130% faster.
        putInlineSlow() microbenchmarks progress by 4-18%.

        [JSC] DFG / FTL should inline switch_string
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224578

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Because of r275840 change, we no longer copy StringJumpTable when compiling DFG / FTL code.
        Instead we are using a pointer to UnlinkedStringTable stored in UnlinkedCodeBlock.
        This allows DFG / FTL to inline CodeBlock which includes op_switch_string. We were previously not able
        to do that because we cannot copy StringImpl in DFG / FTL concurrent compiler thread.

        1. We handle StringJumpTable / UnlinkedStringJumpTable in the same way as SimpleJumpTable / UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable.
        2. We put m_ctiDefault of StringJumpTable in the last element of m_ctiOffsets vector of StringJumpTable to make
           sizeof(StringJumpTable) small.
        3. We use m_indexInTable instead of m_branchOffset in FTL switch generation to make switch table dense.

        The microbenchmark shows 30% improvement because of unlocking inlining feature.

        FullGCActivityCallback should use the percentage of pages uncompressed in RAM to determine deferral.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224817

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Right now we try to determine if too many pages are paged out by
        dereferencing them and bailing out of the GC if we go over a
        deadline. While this works if the only goal is to avoid causing
        extensive thrashing on spinny disks (HDD), it doesn't prevent
        thrashing when access to disk is fast (e.g. SSD). This is because
        on fast disks the proportional time to load the memory from disk
        is much lower. Additionally, on SSDs in particular we don't want
        to load the pages into RAM then bail as that will force a
        different page onto disk, increasing wear.

        This patch switches to asking the OS if each MarkedBlock is paged
        out. Then if we are over a threshold we wait until we would have
        GC'd anyway. This patch uses the (maxVMGrowthFactor - 1) as the
        percentage of "slow" pages (paged out or compressed) needed to
        defer the GC. The idea behind that threshold is that if we add
        that many pages then the same number of pages would be forced
        out of RAM for us to do a GC anyway (in the limit).

        [JSC] Do not use Bag<> for DFG / FTL watchpoints
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224715

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        While Bag<> is useful since its allocated memory will not be moved,
        this is really memory-inefficient data structure. Each entry gets a
        tail pointer (so adding 8 bytes) and we allocate each entry separately.

        In DFG and FTL, we are using Bag<> for watchpoints. But this is not necessary actually: thanks to
        concurrent compilers, our watchpoint registration is batched at the end of compilation. This means
        that we have a way to know how many watchpoints we should register at that point.

        In this patch, we introduce WatchpointCollector. In DesiredGlobalProperties, we run reallyAdd twice
        with WatchpointCollector. First time, we just count # of watchpoints. Then we allocate FixedVector<XXXWatchpoint>
        and install them. Since we do not (cannot) grow this fixed vector, watchpoint's address will not be changed as required.

        We also move DesiredGlobalProperties under DesiredWatchpoints since this basically registers watchpoints.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        1. DFG::JITCode::m_osrEntry / DFG::JITCode::m_osrExit / DFG::JITCode::m_speculationRecovery are changed to FixedVector.
           They are added at compiling time, and after that, these vectors are not modified. So when finalizing, we can easily make it FixedVector.
           We also change OSREntry::{m_reshufflings,m_expectedValues} to FixedVector and FixedOperands.
        2. FTL::JITCode::m_osrExit is changed from SegmentedVector to Vector. We are still using Vector since it also involves osrExitDescriptor.
           But later, we should merge m_osrExit to osrExitDescriptor. Vector is still better than SegmentedVector since it wastes several entries
           per segment. SegmentedVector was used to use a direct pointer of OSRExit (this is not possible in Vector since this pointer can be invalidated
           after growing), but usage of that is fairly limited so that we can just replace them with m_index + osrExit vector.

        HashMapImpl::rehash() should use a version of jsMapHash that cannot throw.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224610
        rdar://76698910

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        For context, HashMapImpl::rehash()'s rehash operation relies on jsMapHash().
        jsMapHash() can be interrupted by a TerminationException, and as a result, may
        not return the string hash we are expecting.  This in turn can lead to the
        rehash operation hashing with wrong keys.

        However, all the keys should have already been hashed.  Hence, rehash() should
        never see an exception thrown there.  We can avoid this complication with the
        TerminationException by simply calling an alternate version of jsMapHash() that
        is guaranteed to never throw e.g. a jsMapHashForAlreadyHashedValue() function.

        Optimize the DeferTermination scope to be more efficient.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224619

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This can be beneficial since we may be using DeferTermination in more places in
        the code.

        1. Added a VMTrapsInlines.h to hold the inline functions.

        2. Split deferTermination() and undoDeferTermination() into fast and slow functions.
           The fast functions are inlineable.

        3. Remove the locking of VMTraps::m_lock in these functions.  These functions only
           modify the following:
           a. VMTraps::m_deferTerminationCount
           b. VMTraps::m_suspendedTerminationException
           c. VMTraps::m_trapBits for setting the NeedTermination bit if needed.
           d. VM::m_exception

           Except for VMTraps::m_trapBits, all of these are only written to from the mutator
           thread.  VMTraps::m_trapBits is always written to using Atomics.  There isn't
           anything that needs to be guarded by VMTraps::m_lock.

        4. Fix VMTraps::deferTermination() to only set m_suspendedTerminationException
           and clear an existing TerminationException if it's being called from the
           outermost DeferTermination (i.e. m_deferTerminationCount is 1 after incrementing).
           These conditional operations are not done in VMTraps::deferTerminationSlow().

           In practice, it wouldn't have mattered anyway because we would never throw a
           TerminationException while a DeferTermination scope is in effect.  The
           the vm.isTerminationException() in the original deferTermination() would
           always have prevented the slow path operations from being executed anyway.

           However, for the purpose of this patch, we want to avoid as much unnecessary
           work as possible in the fast path.  Hence, it is good to skip the slow path
           if deferTermination() isn't called from the outermost scope.

        [JSC] Do not copy SimpleJumpTable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224472

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch avoids copying UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable to SimpleJumpTable by decoupling CTI addresses from jump offset in SimpleJumpTable.
        SimpleJumpTable and UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable are almost identical. SimpleJumpTable adds JIT jump target for each branch.
        We should use data from UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable and jump via SimpleJumpTable. Do not need to have copy of branches from UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable.

        This way removes Vector<SimpleJumpTable> from CodeBlock::RareData. And this is moved to CodeBlock::JITData. And it only includes jump target addresses,
        and branch offset information is kept in UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable side. We no longer need to carefully copy these vectors in CodeBlock including DFG / FTL ones.

        In LLInt, we instead use UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable for jumping.

        In Baseline, we first allocate enough FixedVector<SimpleJumpTable> and fill content via SimpleJumpTable::ensureCTITable() call when compiling corresponding
        switch opcode. Finally we fill these data structures with actual code locations in JIT::link function.

        In DFG, we first collect UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable without copying. This is OK since it is kept by UnlinkedCodeBlock, and UnlinkedCodeBlock is kept by baseline CodeBlocks that
        are handled by this DFG compilation. We hold Vector<const UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable*> in DFG::Graph and we materialize Vector<SimpleJumpTable> in DFG::Graph.
        During DFG compilation, we touch this DFG::Graph's jump tables, and JIT compiler generates code via these tables. And when linking, we move the content to CodeBlock.

        In FTL, while we use UnlinkedSimpleJumpTable in FTL code generation, FTL do not use SimpleJumpTable and instead FTL uses Switch in B3.

        sizeof(KeyValuePair<const Instruction*, MathICGenerationState>) is 136 on some platforms.
        That's on the big side for sparse HashTable entries.  I think using UniqueRef will help performance.

        This is to make sure that these functions don't get in the way of testing with

        Defer TerminationExceptions when evaluating ASSERT in HashMapIml::addNormalized().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224565
        rdar://76645980

        HashMapImpl::addNormalized() has an ASSERT that calls jsMapHash(), which can
        potentially throw exceptions.  As a result, it has a RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION which
        provides an opportunity to handle traps and throw a TerminationException.  This
        in turn causes the ASSERT to fail.

        To fix this, we do:

        1. Introduce VMTraps::DeferAction, which gives us DeferForAWhile and DeferUntilEndOfScope.

        2. Templatize the DeferTermination RAII object on VMTraps::DeferAction.
           Introduce DeferTerrminationForAWhile, which is DeferTermination<VMTraps::DeferAction::DeferForAWhile>.
           DeferForAWhile means that the deferScope will not throw the TerminationException
           on exit.  Instead, it will re-set the NeedTermination bit in the traps, and let
           the next trap check handle it.

        3. Introduce DEFER_TERMINATION_AND_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE (and friends) which creates
           a DeferTerrminationForAWhile scope before doing an ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE.

        4. Use DEFER_TERMINATION_AND_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE instead in HashMapImpl::addNormalized().

        The watchdog is only active when we have entered the VM.  If we haven't entered
        the VM, we postpone starting the watchdog.  For example, see Watchdog::enteredVM()
        and Watchdog::exitedVM().

        The underlying timer may still fire the NeedWatchdogCheck event after
        Watchdog::stopTimer() is called.  So, we need to just ignore the event if the
        watchdog isn't active.

        [JSC] Do not copy StringSwitchJumpTable

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        Previously, we were copying UnlinkedStringJumpTable to CodeBlock's StringJumpTable because we embed CodeLocation pointer
        inside CodeBlock's StringJumpTable. This is copying a mostly identical hashtable to each CodeBlock even in DFG and FTL. This
        even prevents us from inlining op_switch_string in DFG and FTL because (1) we don't want to copy this string tables collected from
        each inlined CodeBlock into a new DFG / FTL CodeBlock and (2) we cannot ref/deref StringImpl inside DFG / FTL compilers so copying
        these tables in the compiler threads need additional "DesiredStringSwitchJumpTable" etc.

        In this patch, we stop copying StringSwitchJumpTable. We decouple CodeLocation pointers from the hashtable so that we can use
        UnlinkedStringJumpTable in UnlinkedCodeBlock. UnlinkedStringJumpTable's hashtable inclues m_indexInTable in each entry so that
        we can have array of CodeLocation pointers in CodeBlock's JITData to have JIT jump targets separately. This design prevents us
        from copying unnecessary hashtables, and even this paves the way to inlining switch_string in DFG and FTL.

        Enable VMTraps checks in RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION.

        rdar://75037057

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        In pre-existing code, termination of a VM's execution can already be requested
        asynchronously (with respect to the mutator thread).  For example, sources of such
        a request can be a watchdog timer firing, or a request to stop execution issued
        from a main web thread to a worker thread.

        This request is made by firing the VMTraps::NeedTermination event on VMTraps.
        Firing the event here only means setting a flag to indicate the presence of the
        request.  We still have to wait till the mutator thread reaches one of the
        pre-designated polling check points to call VMTraps::handleTraps() in order to
        service the request.  As a result of this need to wait for a polling check point,
        if the mutator is executing in a long running C++ loop, then a termination request
        may not be serviced for a long time.

        However, we observed that a lot of our C++ loops already have RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION
        checks.  Hence, if we can check VMTraps::needHandling() there, we can service the
        VMTraps events more frequently even in a lot of C++ loops, and get a better response.

        Full details of what this patch changes:

        1. Shorten some type and methods names in the VMTraps class to make code easier to
           read e.g. EventType => Event, needTrapHandling => needHandling.

        2. Remove the VMTraps::Mask class.  Mask was introduced so that we can express a
           concatenation of multiple VMTraps events to form a bit mask in a simple way.
           In the end, it isn't flexible enough but makes the code more complicated than
           necessary.  It is now replaced by the simpler solution of using macros to define
           the Events as bit fields.  Having Events as bit fields intrinsically make them
           easy to concatenate (bitwise or) or filter (bitwise and).

           Also removed the unused VMTraps::Error class.

        3. Make VMTraps::BitField a uint32_t.  There was always unused padding in VMTraps
           to allow for this.  So, we'll just extend it to a full 32-bit to make it easier
           to add more events in the future for other uses.

        4. Add NeedExceptionHandling as a VMTrap::Event.

        5. Make VMTraps::m_trapBits Atomic.  This makes it easier to set and clear the
           NeedExceptionHandling bit from the mutator without a lock.

        6. RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION now checks VMTraps::m_trapBits (via VMTraps::needHandling())
           instead of checking VM::m_exception.  If the VMTraps::m_trapBits is non-null,
           the macro will call VM:hasExceptionsAfterHandlingTraps() to service VMTraps
           events as appropriate before returning whether an exception is being thrown.
           The result of VM:hasExceptionsAfterHandlingTraps() will determine if
           RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION returns or not.

           VM:hasExceptionsAfterHandlingTraps() is intentionally designed to take a minimum
           of arguments (just the VM as this pointer).  This is because RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION
           is called from many places, and we would like to minimize code size bloating
           from this change.

        7. Simplify paramaters of VMTraps::handleTraps().

           NeedDebuggerBreak's callFrame argument was always vm.topCallFrame anyway.
           So, the patch makes it explicit, and removes the callFrame parameter.

           NeedWatchdogCheck's globalObject argument should have always been
           vm.entryScope->globalObject(), and we can remove the globalObject parameter.

           Before this, we pass in whichever globalObject was convenient to grab hold of.
           However, the idea of the watchdog is to time out the current script executing
           on the stack.  Hence, it makes sense to identify thay script by the globalObject
           in use at VM entry.

           So far, the only clients that uses the watchdog mechanism only operates in
           scenarios with only one globalObject anyway.  So this formalization to use
           VMEntryScope's globalObject does not change the expected behavior.

        8. Make the execution of termination more robust.  Before reading this, please
           read the description of the Events in VMTraps.h first, especially the section
           on NeedTermination.

           Here's the life cycle of a termination:

           a. a client requests termination of the current execution stack by calling
              VM::notifyNeedTermination().  notifyNeedTermination() does 2 things:

               i. fire the NeedTermination event on VMTraps.
              ii. set the VM::m_terminationInProgress flag.

           b. Firing the NeedTermination event on VMTraps means setting the NeedTermination
              bit on VMTraps::m_trapBits.  This bit will be polled by the mutator thread
              later at various designated points (including RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION, which we
              added in this patch).

              Once the mutator sees the NeedTermination bit is set, it will clear the bit
              and throw the TerminationException (see VMTraps::handleTraps()).  This is
              unless the mutator thread is currently in a DeferTermination scope (see (8)
              below).  If in a DeferTermination scope, then it will not throw the
              TerminationException.

              Since the NeedTermination bit is cleared, the VM will no longer call
              VMTraps::handleTraps() to service the event.  If the mutator thread is in
              a DeferTermination scope, then on exiting the scope (at scope destruction),
              the scope will see that VM::m_terminationInProgress is set, and throw the
              deferred TerminationException then.

           c. The TerminationException will trigger unwinding out of the current stack
              until we get to the outermost VMEntryScope.

           d. At the the outermost VMEntryScope, we will clear VM::m_terminationInProgress
              if the NeedTermination bit in VMtraps::m_trapBits is cleared.

              If the NeedTermination bit is set, then that means we haven't thrown the
              TerminationException yet.  Currently, clients expect that we must throw the
              TerminationException if NeedTermination was requested (again, read comments
              at the top of VMTraps.h).

              If the NeedTermination bit is set, we'll leave VM::m_terminationInProgress
              set until the next time we re-enter the VM and exit to the outermost
              VMEntryScope.

           e. The purpose of VM::m_terminationInProgress is to provide a summary of the
              fact that the VM is in a state of trying to terminate the current stack.

              Note that this state is first indicated by the NeedTermination bit being set
              in VMTraps::m_trapBits.  Then, in VMTraps::handleTraps(), the state is
              handed of with the NeedTermination bit being cleared, and the
              TerminationException being thrown.

              While the VM is in this termination state, we need to prevent new DFG/FTL
              JIT code from being compiled and run.  The reason is the firing of the
              NeedTermination event has invalidated DFG/FTL code on the stack, thereby
              allowing their baseline / LLInt versions which have VMTraps polling checks
              to run.  We don't want to compile new DFG / FTL code and possibly get stuck
              in loops in there before the termination is complete.

              In operationOptimize(), we check if VM::m_terminationInProgress is set, and
              prevent new DFG (and therefore FTL) code from being compiled if needed.
              Note: it is easier to check a single flag, VM::m_terminationInProgress,
              then to check both if the NeedTermination bit is set or if the
              TerminationException is being being thrown.

        9. One complication of being able to service VMTraps in RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION checks
           is that some of our code (usually for lengthier initializations and bootstrapping)
           currently does not handle exceptions well, e.g. JSGlobalObject::init().  They
           rely on the code crashing if an exception is thrown while still initializing.

           However, for a worker thread, a TerminationException (requested by the main
           thread) may arrive before the initialization is complete.  This can lead to
           crashes because part of the initialization may be aborted in the presence of
           an exception, while other parts still expect everything prior to have been
           initialized correctly.  For resource exhaustion cases (which is abnormal), it
           is OK to crash.  For the TerminationException (which can be part of normal
           operation), we should not be crashing.

           To work around this, we introduce a DeferTermination RAII scope object that we
           deploy in this type of initialization code.  With the scope in effect,

           a. if a TerminationException arrives but hasn't been thrown yet, it will be
              deferred till the scope ends before being thrown.
           b. if a TerminationException has already been thrown, the scope will stash
              the exception, clear it from the VM so that the initialization code can
              run to completion, and then re-throw the exception when the scope ends.

           Currently, we only need to use the DeferTermination scope in a few places
           where we know that initialization code will only run for a short period of time.

           DeferTermination should not be used for code that can block waiting on an
           external event for a long time.  Obviously, doing so will prevent the VM
           termination mechanism from working.

       10. Replaced llint_slow_path_check_if_exception_is_uncatchable_and_notify_profiler
           and operationCheckIfExceptionIsUncatchableAndNotifyProfiler with
           llint_slow_path_retrieve_and_clear_exception_if_catchable and
           operationRetrieveAndClearExceptionIfCatchable.

           The 2 runtime functions doesn't actually do anything to notify a profiler.
           So, we drop that part of the name.

           After returning from these runtime functions respectively, the previous LLInt
           and JIT code, which calls these runtimes functions, would go on to load
           VM::m_exception, and then store a nullptr there to clear it.  This is wasteful.

           This patch changes the runtime function to clear and return the Exception
           instead.  As a result, the calling LLInt and JIT code is simplified a bit.

           Note also that clearing an exception now also entails clearing the
           NeedExceptionHandling bit in VMTraps::m_trapBits in an atomic way.  The above
           change makes it easy to do this clearing with C++ code.

       11. Fix ScriptFunctionCall::call() to handle exceptions correctly.  Previously,
           it had one case where it propagates an exception, while another eats it.
           Change this function to eat the exception in both cases.  This is approproiate
           because ScriptFunctionCall is only used to execute some Inspector instrumentation
           calls.  It doesn't make sense to propagate the exception back to user code.

       12. Fix the lazy initialization of JSGlobalObject::m_defaultCollator to be able to
           handle the TerminationException.

       13. Not related to TerminationException, but this patch also fixes
           MarkedArgumentBuffer::expandCapacity() to use Gigacage::tryMalloc() instead of
           Gigacage::malloc().  This is needed as one of the fixes to make the
           accompanying test case work.

        This patch increases code size by 320K (144K for JSC, 176K for WebCore) measured
        on x86_64.

        Remove className() and toStringName() from the method table
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224247

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        ES6 introduced Symbol.toStringTag to customize Object.prototype.toString return value.
        It was adopted by WebIDL spec, Chrome's DevTools, Node.js etc. There is no reason to
        keep 2 method table methods, each with only 1 call site, instead of using the symbol.

        Also, it's a bit confusing that for some objects, method table's className() returns
        different result than JSCell::className(VM&).

        This change:

        1. Removes JSProxy's className() / toStringName() methods because its target() is a
           global object that never has these overrides and uses Symbol.toStringTag instead.

        2. Removes DebuggerScope's className() / toStringName() overrides because its objectAtScope()
           has these methods extremely rarely (e.g. `with (new Date) {}`), and its not displayed
           by Web Inspector.

        3. Merges JSCallbackObject's className() / toStringName() methods into Symbol.toStringTag
           branch of getOwnPropertySlot(), with permissive property attributes. To avoid any possible
           breakage, we make sure that it will be shadowed by a structure property.

        4. Reworks JSObject::calculatedClassName() to rely on Symbol.toStringTag, matching Chrome's
           DevTools behavior. On its own, it's a nice change for Web Inspector. We make sure to
           lookup Symbol.toStringTag if `constructor.name` inference fails to avoid confusion when
           extending builtins.

        5. Removes now unused className() from the method table.

        6. Removes toStringName() override from JSFinalizationRegistry because its builtin tag [1]
           is already "Object".

        7. Introduces BooleanObjectType for Boolean wrapper object, and Boolean.prototype as it's
           also required to have a [[BooleanData]] internal slot [2].

        8. Reworks Object.prototype.toString to determine builtin tag [1] based on JSType rather than
           performing method table call. It's guaranteed that a) the set of types we are checking
           against won't be expanded, and b) objects with these types have correct `className`.

        9. Removes now unused toStringTag() from the method table.

        This patch is performance-neutral and carefully preserves current behavior for API objects,
        including isPokerBros() hack.

        [JSC] DUCET level-1 weighs are equal if characters are alphabets
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224047

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Mark Lam.

        ASCII comparison optimization was based on that DUCET level-1 weights are all different (except for 0000 case), but this was wrong.
        If we have the same latin letters with different capitalization, then they have the same level-1 weight ('A' v.s. 'a').
        In this patch,

            1. If we found that the result of level-1 weight comparison is equal, and characters are not equal, then we do level-3 weight comparison.
               We do not perform level-2 since they are all the same weight in ASCII (excluding control characters) region.
            2. We do not perform level-4 weight comparison since level-1 and level-3 comparison must distinguish the strings. Level-1 weights are equal
               only when characters are the same latin letters. And level-3 weight puts different weights for capital latin letters. Since we already know
               that these strings are different while they are equal in level-1 weight comparison, the only case is that they have same latin letters in
               the same position. In that case, level-3 weight must say different results for these characters so that we never meet "equal" status in
               level-3 weight comparison if characters are different.

        Rename and make the TerminationException a singleton.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224295

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        We previously call it the TerminatedExecutionException, which is a mouthful but
        adds no meaningful information.  It's now renamed to TerminationException.

        We can make it a singleton because the TerminationException is just a VM internal
        mechanism for implementing the termination of the current execution stack.  It
        should never be exposed to user JS code, and therefore, there is no value in
        making it a JS object.  Making it a singleton simplifies the code.

        A TerminationException is now implemented as an Exception cell which holds a
        Symbol with the name "TerminationError".  The TerminationException is only created
        if needed e.g. if the JSC watchdog is created, or if the VM is for a Worker thread
        which needs to be able to handle termination requests.

        We'll also stop notifying the debugger when we throw the TerminationException.
        This is because the TerminationException is not like ordinary exceptions that
        should be reported to the debugger. The fact that the TerminationException uses
        the exception handling mechanism is just a VM internal implementation detail.
        It is not meaningful to report it to the debugger as an exception.

        [JSC] WasmMemory caging should care about nullptr

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        1. Fix Wasm::MemoryHandle::boundsCheckingSize. We should just return m_mappedCapacity here since UINT32_MAX is not 4GB.
           This checking size can include redzone for fast-memory, but this is OK: bounds-check pass in LLInt (in upper tiers, we
           do not use bounds-check for fast-memory), and access to redzone, then fault occurs and signal handler can make it error
           since signal handler is checking whether the access is within Memory::fastMappedBytes which includes redzone.
        2. Fix caging of wasm memory-base pointer in LLInt. We should use pointer sized length since it can be larger than 4GB.
           And we should handle nullptr case correctly: Wasm::MemoryHandle's memory can be nullptr when mapped size is zero.
           caging needs to handle this case as we do in CagedPtr::getMayBeNull.

        Use FixedVector more aggressively. This reduces sizeof(Holder) since sizeof(FixedVector) is 8
        while sizeof(Vector) is 16. And since this allocates just-fit size, this does not waste memory.

        Symbol and BigInt wrapper objects should perform OrdinaryToPrimitive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224208

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        ES6 introduced Symbol.toPrimitive as the only way to override ToPrimitive;
        if it's nullish, OrdinaryToPrimitive [1] is performed unconditionally.

        This patch removes two redundant defaultValue() overrides, fixing JSC to call
        (possibly userland) toString() / valueOf() methods of a) Symbol objects whose
        Symbol.toPrimitive was removed, and b) BigInt wrapper objects.

        Aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey. Coercion of primitives is unaffected.
        Also, removes dummy BigIntObject::internalValue() override.

        Aligns JSC with V8 and SpiderMonkey.

        DFG arity fixup nodes should exit to the caller's call opcode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223278

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Right now when we do arity fixup in the DFG we model it in the
        same way that it executes, which means all the nodes are part of
        the callee. Unfortunately, this causes PhantomInsertionPhase to
        think those nodes could be replacing previously defined
        VirtualRegisters as they are part of the callee's header (always
        alive). When PhantomInsertionPhase then inserts a Phantom it will
        put that node in the caller's frame as that's the first ExitOK
        node. The caller however may have no knowledge of that
        VirtualRegister though. For example:

        --> foo: loc10 is a local in foo.
            ...
            1: MovHint(loc10)
            2: SetLocal(loc10)
        <-- foo // loc10 ten is now out of scope for the InlineCallFrame of the caller.
        ...
        // Phantom will be inserted here refering to loc10, which doesn't make sense.
        --> bar // loc10 is an argument to bar and needs arity fixup.
            ... // All of these nodes are ExitInvalid
            3: MovHint(loc10, ExitInvalid)
            4: SetLocal(loc10, ExitInvalid)

        Reduce bytecode instruction count emitted for `class extends`
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223884

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch adds a variant of globalFuncSetPrototypeDirect() that throws on
        invalid [[Prototype]] values (instead of ignoring them) and utilizes it in
        ClassExprNode::emitBytecode(), removing equivalent checks.

        Throwing for invalid `superclass.prototype` value after setting the [[Prototype]]
        of `constructor` is unobservable because it's a newly created extensible object
        and `superclass` is a proven object.

        The fact that [[Prototype]] set can throw only in case of `superclass.prototype`
        allows keeping descriptive error message via custom appender. To find "extends"
        in a source code, ClassExprNode is made an instance of ThrowableExpressionData.

        This change reduces the number of emitted bytecodes by 4, and fixes IsConstructor's
        error [1] to point to correct source code location.

        REGRESSION(r274724): JITCage trampoline needs to be adjusted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224065

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        r274724 introduced a new parameter to custom setters, but it didn't change the parameter recognization of JITCage trampolines for custom accessors.
        As a result, we are jumping with the wrong pointer, and crash when custom setter is called with JITCage.

        This patch fixes the above bug.

        1. Now, custom getter and custom setter have different number of parameters. We should have two different trampolines to invoke it. We remove vmEntryCustomAccessor, and
           add vmEntryCustomGetter/vmEntryCustomSetter.
        2. vmEntryCustomSetter should use a4 parameter as a executable address for trampoline.

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        createListFromArrayLike() changes:

          1. Use toLength() / getIndex() methods that have fast paths.
          2. Remove RuntimeTypeMask and error messages from its signature: type checks are better
             performed in advance / inside a functor to keep the helper more versatile.
          3. Invert functor's return value to align with Structure::forEachProperty() and friends.
          4. Rename it to forEachInArrayLike() as no list is actually returned.

        ProxyObject::performGetOwnPropertyNames() changes:

          1. Remove RuntimeTypeMask filtering as it's already performed by PropertyNameArray::add().
          2. Store target's keys in a HashSet for faster insertion / search.
          3. Don't populate `targetConfigurableKeys` for extensible target as it won't be used [1].
          4. Leverage return value of HashSet::remove() instead of using a helper.

        This patch advances Proxy's [[OwnPropertyKeys]] microbenchmarks by 20-30%,
        mainly due to createListFromArrayLike() changes. No behavior changes.

        Also, utilizes forEachInArrayLike() for allow list of JSON.stringify().

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This patch speeds up the constructors by avoiding call() for non-observable
        "set" / "add" methods and using getIndex() for Map / WeakMap collections.

        For Map / Set, this change leverages existing cloning helpers, which rely on
        watchpoints, to avoid even a method lookup. However, slower path is used for
        subclasses. Results in 1.9x speed-up for common case.

        For WeakMap / WeakSet, adder function is checked by C++ pointer, which enables
        fast path even for cross-realm subclasses. Results in 2.3x progression.

        Both approaches require special handling of a cross-realm NewTarget to ensure
        that raised exceptions (OOM / TypeError) belong to realm of the adder function,
        and not to constructor's or NewTarget's.

        Also, adds descriptve error messages for non-callable "set" / "add" properties.

        We rely on GlobalPropertyInfo being allocated on the stack to allow its JSValue
        value to be scanned by the GC.  Unfortunately, an ASAN compilation would choose
        to allocate the GlobalPropertyInfo on a side buffer instead of directly on the
        stack.  This prevents the GC from doing the needed scan.

        We'll fix this by suppressing ASAN on the functions that allocated GlobalPropertyInfo
        arrays.  Also added an ASSERT in the GlobalPropertyInfo constructor to assert that
        it is allocated on the stack.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        uloc_canonicalize does not perform alias mapping. This is different from ECMA402's canonicalization requirement.
        ICU C++ icu::Locale can canonicalize locale ID with alias mapping, but this is not exposed to C API.

        In this patch, we adopt AppleICU SPI "ualoc_canonicalForm" added in rdar://74314220. This canonicalization can perform
        alias mapping too. We do not extend uloc_canonicalize since this API explicitly says "It does NOT map aliased names in any way."[1].

        So we can modify underlying HashMap while we are just touching it for HashMap::ensure. This
        can corrupt HashMap. To ensure this invariant, we put DisallowGC for WeakGCMap::ensureValue.
        So we cannot invoke GC in the functor of that function (otherwise, assertion hits).

        And we use DeferGC in createCustomGetterFunction / createCustomSetterFunction to avoid invoking
        GC in WeakGCMap::ensureValue. This defers GC invocation until this DeferGC scope is destroyed,

        PropertyName is the holder for passing it as an argument, and it does not ref/deref underlying UniqueStringImpl.
        We should use Identifier to keep it strongly ref-ed in JSCustomGetterFunction/JSCustomSetterFunction.
        And we should make JSCustomGetterFunction/JSCustomSetterFunction destructible objects since Identifier needs to
        deref underlying UniqueStringImpl when destroying these functions.

        We need to check that we read an actual character before seeing if it is part of a character class.
        In the case where we are checking that a character is not in a character class, like .,
        the failed to read result from input.readChecked(), -1, is not part of the newline character class.

        BrandedStructure should keep its members alive.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223495
        rdar://75565765

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Normally, each type of JSCell would have its own structure (and therefore, its own
        ClassInfo, MethodTable, etc), which would have handled visiting m_parentBrand.
        Similarly, it would have its own destructor, which would deref m_brand.

        However, the design of BrandedStructure is not like other JSCells.  As present,
        we have chosen to go with having BrandedStructure look exactly like a regular
        Structure, except that its isBrandedStructure flag is set to true.

        This design has advantages because we do checks all over the system for whether
        a cell is a Structure by simply comparing its structureID to structureStructure's
        structureID.  By virtue of BrandedStructure having the same structure as Structure,
        none of this code need to change.

        The downside is that we need to enhance Structure's methods to check if it is
        actually working on an instance of BrandedStructure, and do some additional work.

        This patch fixes 2 bugs:

        1. m_parentBrand was not visited by visitChildren().

           Structure::visitChildrenImpl() now calls BrandedStructure::visitAdditionalChildren()
           to handle this.

        2. m_brand needs to be ref'ed.

           In Structure::setBrandTransition(), if the BrandedStructure is a dictionary,
           then its m_transitionPropertyName will be cleared.  m_transitionPropertyName
           was the only means by which the UniqueStringImpl pointed to by m_brand was
           ref'ed.  The fix is to make m_brand a RefPtr.

           Hence, it follows that we also need to deref m_brand on destruction.
           Structure's destructor now calls BrandedStructure::destruct() to handle this.
