            JavaScriptCore ArrayPrototype::join shouldn't cache butterfly when it makes effectful calls
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155776

            Reviewed by Saam Barati.

            Array.join ends up calling toString, possibly on some object.  Since these calls
            could be effectful and could change the array itself, we can't hold the butterfly
            pointer while making effectful calls.  Changed the code to fall back to the general
            case when an effectful toString() call might be made.

            Web Inspector: Reduce list of saved console messages
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151225

            Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

            Inspector saves messages so that when an inspector frontend opens it can report
            these messages to the frontend. However we were saving a rather large list of
            1000 messages. Most pages do not produce a large number of console messages.
            However pages that live for a long time can generate many errors over time,
            especially periodic engine issues such as cross-origin access errors. This could
            result in a lot of wasted memory for console messages that may never be used.

            Likewise when an inspector first open sending all 1000 messages to the frontend
            results in a poor experience.

            Lets reduce the list of saved messages. Developer will still be able to see
            all messages as long as they have Web Inspector open at the time the messages
            are generated.

            * inspector/agents/InspectorConsoleAgent.cpp:
            Reduce the list from 1000 to 100. Also, when expiring
            messages from this list, chunk in 10s instead of 100s.

            Web Inspector: no need to allocate protocolErrors array for every dispatched backend command
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146466

            Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

            Clean up some of the backend dispatcher code, with a focus on eliminating useless allocations
            of objects in the common case when no protocol errors happen. This is done by saving the
            current id of each request as it is being processed by the backend dispatcher, and tagging any
            subsequent errors with that id. This also means we don't have to thread the requestId except
            in the async command code path.

            This patch also lifts some common code shared between all generated backend command
            implementatations into the per-domain dispatch method instead. This reduces generated code size.

            To be consistent, this patch standardizes on calling the id of a backend message its 'requestId'.
            Requests can be handled synchronously or asynchronously (triggered via the 'async' property).

            No new tests, covered by existing protocol tests.

            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147097

            Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

            A new test revealed that the protocol "method" parameter was being parsed in a naive way.
            Rewrite it to use String::split and improve error checking to avoid failing later.

            StackOverflow stack unwinding should stop at native frames.
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148749

            Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

            In the present code, after ping-pong'ing back and forth between native and JS
            code a few times, if we have a stack overflow on re-entry into the VM to run
            JS code's whose stack frame would overflow the JS stack, the code will end up
            unwinding past the native function that is making the call to re-enter the VM.
            As a result, any clean up code (e.g. destructors for stack variables) in the
            skipped native function frame (and its chain of native function callers) will
            not be called.

            This patch is based on the Michael Saboff's fix of this issue landed on the
            jsc-tailcall branch: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/188555

            We now check for the case where there are no JS frames to unwind since the
            last native frame, and treat the exception as an unhandled exception.  The
            native function is responsible for further propagating the exception if needed.

            Other supporting work:
            1. Remove vm->vmEntryFrameForThrow.  It should always be the same as
               vm->topVMEntryFrame.
            2. Change operationThrowStackOverflowError() to use the throwStackOverflowError()
               helper function instead of rolling its own.
            3. Added a test that exercises this edge case.  The test should not hang or crash.

            We need to ensure that we round up sizeof(MarkedBlock) to an
            atomSize boundary. We need to do this because the first atom
            inside the MarkedBlock will start at the rounded up multiple
            of atomSize past MarkedBlock. If we end up with an allocation
            that is perfectly aligned to the page size, then we will be short
            8 bytes (in the current implementation where atomSize is 16 bytes,
            and MarkedBlock is 248 bytes).

            DFG::ArgumentsEliminationPhase should emit a PutStack for all of the GetStacks that the ByteCodeParser emitted
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147433

            Reviewed by Mark Lam.

            Ideally, the ByteCodeParser would only emit SetArgument nodes for named arguments.  But
            currently that's not what it does - it emits a SetArgument for every argument that a varargs
            call may pass.  Each SetArgument gets turned into a GetStack.  This means that if
            ArgumentsEliminationPhase optimizes away PutStacks for those varargs arguments that didn't
            get passed or used, we get degenerate IR where we have a GetStack of something that didn't
            have a PutStack.

            This fixes the bug by removing the code to optimize away PutStacks in
            ArgumentsEliminationPhase.

            Fixed VM pool allocation should have a reserve for allocations that cannot fail
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147154

            This adds the notion of a JIT pool reserve fraction. Some fraction, currently 1/4, of
            the JIT pool is reserved for allocations that cannot fail. It makes sense to make this
            a fraction rather than a constant because each allocation that can fail may cause some
            number of allocations that cannot fail (for example, the OSR exit thunks that we
            compile when we exit from some CodeBlock cannot fail).

            I've tested this by adding a test mode where we artificially limit the JIT pool size.
            Prior to the fix, we had >20 failures. Now we have none.
