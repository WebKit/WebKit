        REGRESSION (182567): regress/script-tests/sorting-benchmark.js fails on 32 bit dfg-eager tests

        For 32 bit builds, we favor spilling unboxed values.  The ASSERT at the root of this bug doesn't
        fire for 64 bit builds, because we spill an "Other" value as a full JS value (DataFormatJS).
        For 32 bit builds however, if we are able, we spill Other values as JSCell* (DataFormatCell).
        The fix is to add a check in fillSpeculateInt32Internal() before the ASSERT that always OSR exits
        if the spillFormat is DataFormatCell.  Had we spilled in DataFormatJS and the value was a JSCell*,
        we would still OSR exit after the speculation check.

        DFG OSR exit shouldn't assume that the frame count for exit is greater than the frame count in DFG
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142948

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.
        
        It's necessary to ensure that the stack pointer accounts for the extent of our stack usage
        since a signal may clobber the area below the stack pointer. When the DFG is executing,
        the stack pointer accounts for the DFG's worst-case stack usage. When we OSR exit back to
        baseline, we will use a different amount of stack. This is because baseline is a different
        compiler. It will make different decisions. So it will use a different amount of stack.
        
        This gets tricky when we are in the process of doing an OSR exit, because we are sort of
        incrementally transforming the stack from how it looked in the DFG to how it will look in
        baseline. The most conservative approach would be to set the stack pointer to the max of
        DFG and baseline.
        
        When this code was written, a reckless assumption was made: that the stack usage in
        baseline is always at least as large as the stack usage in DFG. Based on this incorrect
        assumption, the code first adjusts the stack pointer to account for the baseline stack
        usage. This sort of usually works, because usually baseline does happen to use more stack.
        But that's not an invariant. Nobody guarantees this. We will never make any changes that
        would make this be guaranteed, because that would be antithetical to how optimizing
        compilers work. The DFG should be allowed to use however much stack it decides that it
        should use in order to get good performance, and it shouldn't try to guarantee that it
        always uses less stack than baseline.
        
        As such, we must always assume that the frame size for DFG execution (i.e.
        frameRegisterCount) and the frame size in baseline once we exit (i.e.
        requiredRegisterCountForExit) are two independent quantities and they have no
        relationship.
        
        Fortunately, though, this code can be made correct by just moving the stack adjustment to
        just before we do conversions. This is because we have since changed the OSR exit
        algorithm to first lift up all state from the DFG state into a scratch buffer, and then to
        drop it out of the scratch buffer and into the stack according to the baseline layout. The
        point just before conversions is the point where we have finished reading the DFG frame
        and will not read it anymore, and we haven't started writing the baseline frame. So, at
        this point it is safe to set the stack pointer to account for the frame size at exit.
        
        This is benign because baseline happens to create larger frames than DFG.

        Before this patch, added function JSValue::toPropertyKey returns PropertyName.
        Since PropertyName doesn't have AtomicStringImpl ownership,
        if Identifier is implicitly converted to PropertyName and Identifier is destructed,
        PropertyName may refer freed AtomicStringImpl*.

        This patch changes the result type of JSValue::toPropertyName from PropertyName to Identifier,
        to keep AtomicStringImpl* ownership after the toPropertyName call is done.
        And receive the result value as Identifier type to keep ownership in the caller side.

        To catch the result of toPropertyKey as is, we catch the result of toPropertyName as auto.

        However, now we don't need to have both Identifier and PropertyName.

        Stale entries in WeakGCMaps are keeping tons of WeakBlocks alive unnecessarily.
        <https://webkit.org/b/142115>
        <rdar://problem/19992268>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Prune stale entries from WeakGCMaps as part of every full garbage collection.
        This frees up tons of previously-stuck WeakBlocks that were only sitting around
        with finalized handles waiting to die.

        Note that WeakGCMaps register/unregister themselves with the GC heap in their
        ctor/dtor, so creating one now requires passing the VM.

        Average time spent in the PruningStaleEntriesFromWeakGCMaps GC phase appears
        to be between 0.01ms and 0.3ms, though I've seen a few longer ones at ~1.2ms.
        It seems somewhat excessive to do this on every Eden collection, so it's only
        doing work in full collections for now.

        Because the GC may now mutate WeakGCMap below object allocation, I've made it
        so that the classic HashMap::add() optimization can't be used with WeakGCMap.
        This caused intermittent test failures when originally landed due to having
        an invalid iterator on the stack after add() inserted a new entry and we
        proceeded to allocate the new object, triggering GC.

        The wrapper function that grabs a snapshot of the current stack boundaries and register values

        This is a speculative fix for what appears to be overly conservative behavior in the garbage
        collector following r178364 which caused a measurable regression in memory usage on Membuster.
        The theory being that we were putting pointers to dead things on the stack before scanning it,

        MachineThreads::Thread clean up has a use after free race condition.
        <https://webkit.org/b/141990>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        MachineThreads::Thread clean up relies on the clean up mechanism
        implemented in _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key(), which looks like this:

        void _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key(pthread_t self, pthread_key_t key)
        {
            void (*destructor)(void *);
            if (_pthread_key_get_destructor(key, &destructor)) {
                void **ptr = &self->tsd[key];
                void *value = *ptr;

            // === Start of window for the bug to manifest =================

                // At this point, this thread has cached "destructor" and "value"
                // (which is a MachineThreads*).  If the VM gets destructed (along
                // with its MachineThreads registry) by another thread, then this
                // thread will have no way of knowing that the MachineThreads* is
                // now pointing to freed memory.  Calling the destructor below will
                // therefore result in a use after free scenario when it tries to
                // access the MachineThreads' data members.

                if (value) {
                    *ptr = NULL;
                    if (destructor) {

            // === End of window for the bug to manifest ==================

                        destructor(value);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        The fix is to add each active MachineThreads to an ActiveMachineThreadsManager,
        and always check if the manager still contains that MachineThreads object
        before we call removeCurrentThread() on it.  When MachineThreads is destructed,
        it will remove itself from the manager.  The add, remove, and checking
        operations are all synchronized on the manager's lock, thereby ensuring that
        the MachineThreads object, if found in the manager, will remain alive for the
        duration of time we call removeCurrentThread() on it.

        There's also possible for the MachineThreads object to already be destructed
        and another one happened to have been instantiated at the same address.
        Hence, we should only remove the exiting thread if it is found in the
        MachineThreads object.

        There is no test for this issue because this bug requires a race condition
        between 2 threads where:
        1. Thread B, which had previously used the VM, exiting and
           getting to the bug window shown in _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key() above.
        2. Thread A destructing the VM (and its MachineThreads object)
           within that window of time before Thread B calls the destructor.

        It is not possible to get a reliable test case without invasively
        instrumenting _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key() or MachineThreads::removeCurrentThread()
        to significantly increase that window of opportunity.

        When window.Symbol is exposed to user-space pages,
        Facebook's JavaScript use it (maybe, for immutable-js and React.js's unique key).

        1) Object.getOwnPropertySymbols (for mixin including Symbols)
        2) the latest ES6 Iterator interface that uses Iterator.next and it returns { done: boolean, value: value }.
        Since they are not landed yet, comments in Facebook don't work.

        This patch introduces RuntimeFlags for JavaScriptCore.
        Specifying SymbolEnabled flag under test runner and inspector to continue to work with Symbol.
        And drop JavaScriptExperimentsEnabled flag

        DFG JIT needs to check for stack overflow at the start of Program and Eval execution
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141676

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Added stack check to the beginning of the code the DFG copmiler emits for Program and Eval nodes.
        To aid in testing the code, I replaced the EvalCodeCache::maxCacheableSourceLength const
        a options in runtime/Options.h.  The test script, run-jsc-stress-tests, sets that option
        to a huge value when running with the "Eager" options.  This allows the updated test to 
        reliably exercise the code in questions.

        I broke C-Loop when moving the common code of pow()
        to JITOperations because that file is #ifdefed out
        when the JITs are disabled.

        It would be weird to move it back to MathObject since
        the function needs to know about the calling conventions.

        To avoid making a mess, I just gave the function its own file
        that is used by both the runtime and the JIT.

        DFG SSA should use GetLocal for arguments, and the GetArgument node type should be removed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141623

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.
        
        During development of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141332, I realized that I
        needed to use GetArgument for loading something that has magically already appeared on the
        stack, so currently trunk sort of allows this. But then I realized three things:
        
        - A GetArgument with a non-JSValue flush format means speculating that the value on the
          stack obeys that format, rather than just assuming that that it already has that format.
          In bug 141332, I want it to assume rather than speculate. That also happens to be more
          intuitive; I don't think I was wrong to expect that.
        
        - The node I really want is GetLocal. I'm just getting the value of the local and I don't
          want to do anything else.
        
        - Maybe it would be easier if we just used GetLocal for all of the cases where we currently
          use GetArgument.
        
        This changes the FTL to do argument speculations in the prologue just like the DFG does.
        This brings some consistency to our system, and allows us to get rid of the GetArgument
        node. The speculations that the FTL must do are now made explicit in the m_argumentFormats
        vector in DFG::Graph. This has natural DCE behavior: even if all uses of the argument are
        dead we will still speculate. We already have safeguards to ensure we only speculate if
        there are uses that benefit from speculation (which is a much more conservative criterion
        than DCE).

        This simple adjustment appears to be a 2% speed-up on Octane. Over time, the slow case
        heuristic has essentially stopped working because the typical execution count threshold for a
        bytecode instruction is around 66 while the slow case threshold is 100: virtually
        guaranteeing that the DFG will never think that a bytecode instruction has taken the slow
        case even if it took it every single time. So, this changes the slow case threshold to 20.
        
        I checked if we could lower this down further, like to 10. That is worse than 20, and about
        as bad as 100.

        doesn't actually put the argument count at the JSStack::ArgumentCount offset. In fact there
        is really no such thing as an inlineStackOffset except when we OSR exit; while the code is

        Crash in JSC::FTL::LowerDFGToLLVM::compileCompareStrictEq
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139398

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Due to CFA analysis, the CompareStrictEq node was determined to be unreachable, but later
        was determined to be reachable.  When we go to lower to LLVM, the edges for the CompareStrictEq
        node are UntypedUse which we can't compile.  Fixed this by checking that the IR before
        lowering can still be handled by the FTL.

        Had to add GetArgument as a node that the FTL can compile as the SSA conversion phase converts
        a SetArgument to a GetArgument.  Before this change FTL::canCompile() would never see a GetArgument
        node.  With the check right before lowering, we see this node.

        Not only was this not used, I believe that the math was wrong. The callee frame doesn't
        actually land past m_nextMachineLocal; instead it lands just below wherever we put SP and
        that decision is made elsewhere. Also, it makes no sense to subtract 1 from

        DFG::StackLayoutPhase should always set the scopeRegister to VirtualRegister() because the DFG doesn't do anything to make its value valid
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141412

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        StackLayoutPhase was attempting to ensure that the register that
        CodeBlock::scopeRegister() points to is the right one for the DFG. But the DFG did nothing
        else to maintain the validity of the scopeRegister(). It wasn't captured as far as I can
        tell. StackLayoutPhase didn't explicitly mark it live. PreciseLocalClobberize didn't mark
        it as being live. So, by the time we got here the register referred to by
        CodeBlock::scopeRegister() would have been junk. Moreover, CodeBlock::scopeRegister() was
        not used for DFG code blocks, and was hardly ever used outside of bytecode generation.
        
        So, this patch just removes the code to manipulate this field and replaces it with an
        unconditional setScopeRegister(VirtualRegister()). Setting it to the invalid register
        ensures that any attempst to read the scopeRegister in a DFG or FTL frame immediately
        punts.

        Varargs frame set-up should be factored out for use by other JITs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141388

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        Previously the code that dealt with varargs always assumed that we were setting up a varargs call
        frame by literally following the execution semantics of op_call_varargs. This isn't how it'll
        happen once the DFG and FTL do varargs calls, or when varargs calls get inlined. The DFG and FTL
        don't literally execute bytecode; for example their stack frame layout has absolutely nothing in
        common with what the bytecode says, and that will never change.
        
        This patch makes two changes:
        
        Setting up the varargs callee frame can be done in smaller steps: particularly in the case of a
        varargs call that gets inlined, we aren't going to actually want to set up a callee frame in
        full - we just want to put the arguments somewhere, and that place will not have much (if
        anything) in common with the call frame format. This patch factors that out into something called
        a loadVarargs. The thing we used to call loadVarargs is now called setupVarargsFrame. This patch
        also separates loading varargs from setting this, since the fact that those two things are done
        together is a detail made explicit in bytecode but it's not at all required in the higher-tier
        engines. In the process of factoring this code out, I found a bunch of off-by-one errors in the
        various calculations. I fixed them. The distance from the caller's frame pointer to the callee
        frame pointer is always:
        
            numUsedCallerSlots + argCount + 1 + CallFrameSize
        
        where numUsedCallerSlots is toLocal(firstFreeRegister) - 1, which simplifies down to just
        -firstFreeRegister. The code now speaks of numUsedCallerSlots rather than firstFreeRegister,
        since the latter is a bytecode peculiarity that doesn't apply in the DFG or FTL. In the DFG, the
        internally-computed frame size, minus the parameter slots, will be used for numUsedCallerSlots.
        In the FTL, we will essentially compute numUsedCallerSlots dynamically by subtracting SP from FP.
        Eventually, LLVM might give us some cleaner way of doing this, but it probably doesn't matter
        very much.
        
        The arguments forwarding optimization is factored out of the Baseline JIT: the DFG and FTL will
        want to do this optimization as well, but it involves quite a bit of code. So, this code is now
        factored out into SetupVarargsFrame.h|cpp, so that other JITs can use it. In the process of factoring
        this code out I noticed that the 32-bit and 64-bit code is nearly identical, so I combined them.

        DFG should only have two mechanisms for describing effectfulness of nodes; previously there were three

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        We previously used the NodeMightClobber and NodeClobbersWorld NodeFlags to describe
        effectfulness.  Starting over a year ago, we introduced a more powerful mechanism - the
        DFG::clobberize() function.  Now we only have one remaining client of the old NodeFlags,
        and everyone else uses DFG::clobberize().  We should get rid of those NodeFlags and
        finally switch everyone over to DFG::clobberize().
        
        Unfortunately there is still another place where effectfulness of nodes is described: the
        AbstractInterpreter. This is because the AbstractInterpreter has special tuning both for
        compile time performance and there are places where the AI is more precise than
        clobberize() because of its flow-sensitivity.
        
        This means that after this change there will be only two places, rather than three, where

        The VM's MachineThreads registry object is being referenced from other
        threads as a raw pointer.  In a scenario where the VM is destructed on
        the main thread, there is no guarantee that another thread isn't still
        holding a reference to the registry and will eventually invoke
        removeThread() on it on thread exit.  Hence, there's a possible use
        after free scenario here.

        The fix is to make MachineThreads ThreadSafeRefCounted, and have all
        threads that references keep a RefPtr to it to ensure that it stays
        alive until the very last thread is done with it.

        Remove BytecodeGenerator::preserveLastVar() and replace it with a more robust mechanism for preserving non-temporary registers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141211

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Previously, the way non-temporary registers were preserved (i.e. not reclaimed anytime
        we did newTemporary()) by calling preserveLastVar() after all non-temps are created. It
        would raise the refcount on the last (highest-numbered) variable created, and rely on
        the fact that register reclamation started at higher-numbered registers and worked its
        way down. So any retained register would block any lower-numbered registers from being
        reclaimed.
        
        Also, preserveLastVar() sets a thing called m_firstConstantIndex. It's unused.
        
        This removes preserveLastVar() and makes addVar() retain each register it creates. This
        is more explicit, since addVar() is the mechanism for creating non-temporary registers.
        
        To make this work I had to remove an assertion that Register::setIndex() can only be
        called when the refcount is zero. This method might be called after a var is created to
        change its index. This previously worked because preserveLastVar() would be called after
        we had already made all index changes, so the vars would still have refcount zero. Now
        they have refcount 1. I think it's OK to lose this assertion; I can't remember this
        assertion ever firing in a way that alerted me to a serious issue.

        CodeCache is not thread safe when adding the same source from two different threads
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141275

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        The issue for this bug is that one thread, takes a cache miss in CodeCache::getGlobalCodeBlock,
        but in the process creates a cache entry with a nullptr UnlinkedCodeBlockType* which it
        will fill in later in the function.  During the body of that function, it allocates
        objects that may garbage collect.  During that garbage collection, we drop the all locks.
        While the locks are released by the first thread, another thread can enter the VM and might
        have exactly the same source and enter CodeCache::getGlobalCodeBlock() itself.  When it
        looks up the code block, it sees it as a cache it and uses the nullptr UnlinkedCodeBlockType*
        and crashes.  This fixes the problem by not dropping the locks during garbage collection.
        There are other likely scenarios where we have a data structure like this code cache in an
        unsafe state for arbitrary reentrance.

        Moved the functionality of DelayedReleaseScope directly into Heap.  Changed it into
        a simple list that is cleared with the new function Heap::releaseDelayedReleasedObjects.
        Now we accumulate objects to be released and release them when all locks are dropped or
        when destroying the Heap.  This eliminated the dropping and reaquiring of locks associated
        with the old scope form of this list.

        Given that all functionality of DelayedReleaseScope is now used and referenced by Heap
        and the lock management no longer needs to be done, just made the list a member of Heap.
        We do need to guard against the case that releasing an object can create more objects
        by calling into JS.  That is why releaseDelayedReleasedObjects() is written to remove
        an object to release so that we aren't recursively in Vector code.  The other thing we
        do in releaseDelayedReleasedObjects() is to guard against recursive calls to itself using
        the m_delayedReleaseRecursionCount.  We only release at the first entry into the function.
        This case is already tested by testapi.mm.

        Remove concept of makeUsableFromMultipleThreads().
        <https://webkit.org/b/141221>

        Reviewed by Mark Hahnenberg.

        Currently, we rely on VM::makeUsableFromMultipleThreads() being called before we
        start acquiring the JSLock and entering the VM from different threads.
        Acquisition of the JSLock will register the acquiring thread with the VM's thread
        registry if not already registered.  However, it will only do this if the VM's
        thread specific key has been initialized by makeUsableFromMultipleThreads().

        This is fragile, and also does not read intuitively because one would expect to
        acquire the JSLock before calling any methods on the VM.  This is exactly what
        JSGlobalContextCreateInGroup() did (i.e. acquire the lock before calling
        makeUsableFromMultipleThreads()), but is wrong.  The result is that the invoking
        thread will not have been registered with the VM during that first entry into
        the VM.

        The fix is to make it so that we initialize the VM's thread specific key on
        construction of the VM's MachineThreads registry instead of relying on
        makeUsableFromMultipleThreads() being called.  With this, we can eliminate
        makeUsableFromMultipleThreads() altogether.

        Performance results are neutral in aggregate.

        There's a bug where thread destructors may not get called.  As far as
        we know, this only manifests on darwin ports.  We will work around this
        by checking at GC time if the platform thread is still valid.  If not,
        we'll purge it from the VM's registeredThreads list before proceeding
        with thread scanning activity.

        Note: it is important that we do this invalid thread detection during
        suspension, because the validity (and liveness) of the other thread is
        only guaranteed while it is suspended.

        arguments[-1] should have well-defined behavior

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.
        
        According to JSC's internal argument numbering, 0 is "this" and 1 is the first argument.
        In the "arguments[i]" expression, "this" is not accessible and i = 0 refers to the first
        argument. Previously we handled the bounds check in "arguments[i]" - where "arguments" is
        statically known to be the current function's arguments object - as follows:
        
            add 1, i
            branchAboveOrEqual i, callFrame.ArgumentCount, slowPath
        
        The problem with this is that if i = -1, this passes the test, and we end up accessing
        what would be the "this" argument slot. That's wrong, since we should really be bottoming
        out in arguments["-1"], which is usually undefined but could be anything. It's even worse
        if the function is inlined or if we're in a constructor - in that case the "this" slot
        could be garbage.
        
        It turns out that we had this bug in all of our engines.
        
        This fixes the issue by changing the algorithm to:
        
            load32 callFrame.ArgumentCount, tmp
            sub 1, tmp
            branchAboveOrEqual i, tmp, slowPath
        
        In some engines, we would have used the modified "i" (the one that had 1 added to it) for
        the subsequent argument load; since we don't do this anymore I also had to change some of
        the offsets on the BaseIndex arguments load.
        
        This also includes tests that are written in such a way as to get coverage on LLInt and
        Baseline JIT (get-my-argument-by-val-wrap-around-no-warm-up), DFG and FTL

        overwriting the "arguments" variable (get-my-argument-by-val-safe-wrap-around). This also
        includes off-by-1 out-of-bounds tests for each of these cases, since in the process of
        writing the patch I broke the arguments[arguments.length] case in the DFG and didn't see
        any test failures.

        BinarySwitch should be faster on average
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141046

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.
        
        This optimizes our binary switch using math. It's strictly better than what we had before
        assuming we bottom out in some case (rather than fall through), assuming all cases get
        hit with equal probability. The difference is particularly large for large switch
        statements. For example, a switch statement with 1000 cases would previously require on
        average 13.207 branches to get to some case, while now it just requires 10.464.
        
        This is also a progression for the fall-through case, though we could shave off another
        1/6 branch on average if we wanted to - though it would regress taking a case (not falling
        through) by 1/6 branch. I believe it's better to bias the BinarySwitch for not falling
        through.
        
        This also adds some randomness to the algorithm to minimize the likelihood of us
        generating a switch statement that is always particularly bad for some input. Note that
        the randomness has no effect on average-case performance assuming all cases are equally
        likely.
        
        This ought to have no actual performance change because we don't rely on binary switches
        that much. The main reason why this change is interesting is that I'm finding myself
        increasingly relying on BinarySwitch, and I'd like to know that it's optimal.

        Create tests for JSC's Control Flow Profiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141123

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch creates a control flow profiler testing API in jsc.cpp 
        that accepts a function and a string as arguments. The string must 
        be a substring of the text of the function argument. The API returns 
        a boolean indicating whether or not the basic block that encloses the 
        substring has executed.

        This patch uses this API to test that the control flow profiler
        behaves as expected on basic block boundaries. These tests do not
        provide full coverage for all JavaScript statements that can create
        basic blocks boundaries. Full coverage will come in a later patch.

        Polymorphic call inlining should be based on polymorphic call inline caching rather than logging
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140660

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        When we first implemented polymorphic call inlining, we did the profiling based on a call
        edge log. The idea was to store each call edge (a tuple of call site and callee) into a
        global log that was processed lazily. Processing the log would give precise counts of call
        edges, and could be used to drive well-informed inlining decisions - polymorphic or not.
        This was a speed-up on throughput tests but a slow-down for latency tests. It was a net win
        nonetheless.
        
        Experience with this code shows three things. First, the call edge profiler is buggy and
        complex. It would take work to fix the bugs. Second, the call edge profiler incurs lots of
        overhead for latency code that we care deeply about. Third, it's not at all clear that
        having call edge counts for every possible callee is any better than just having call edge
        counts for the limited number of callees that an inline cache would catch.
        
        So, this patch removes the call edge profiler and replaces it with a polymorphic call inline
        cache. If we miss the basic call inline cache, we inflate the cache to be a jump to an
        out-of-line stub that cases on the previously known callees. If that misses again, then we
        rewrite that stub to include the new callee. We do this up to some number of callees. If we
        hit the limit then we switch to using a plain virtual call.
        
        Substantial speed-up on V8Spider; undoes the slow-down that the original call edge profiler
        caused. Might be a SunSpider speed-up (below 1%), depending on hardware.

        Implement ES6 Symbol

        This patch implements ES6 Symbol. In this patch, we don't support
        Symbol.keyFor, Symbol.for, Object.getOwnPropertySymbols. They will be
        supported in the subsequent patches.

        Since ES6 Symbol is introduced as new primitive value, we implement
        Symbol as a derived class from JSCell. And now JSValue accepts Symbol*
        as a new primitive value.

        Symbol has a *unique* flagged StringImpl* as an `uid`. Which pointer
        value represents the Symbol's identity. So don't compare Symbol's
        JSCell pointer value for comparison.
        This enables re-producing Symbol primitive value from StringImpl* uid
        by executing`Symbol::create(vm, uid)`. This is needed to produce
        Symbol primitive values from stored StringImpl* in `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`.

        And Symbol.[[Description]] is folded into the string value of Symbol's uid.
        By doing so, we can represent ES6 Symbol without extending current PropertyTable key; StringImpl*.

        Implement ES6 class syntax without inheritance support

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Added the most basic support for ES6 class syntax. After this patch, we support basic class definition like:
        class A {
            constructor() { }
            someMethod() { }
        }

        We'll add the support for "extends" keyword and automatically generating a constructor in follow up patches.
        We also don't support block scoping of a class declaration.

        We support both class declaration and class expression. A class expression is implemented by the newly added
        ClassExprNode AST node. A class declaration is implemented by ClassDeclNode, which is a thin wrapper around
        AssignResolveNode.

        Polymorphic call inlining should be based on polymorphic call inline caching rather than logging
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140660

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        When we first implemented polymorphic call inlining, we did the profiling based on a call
        edge log. The idea was to store each call edge (a tuple of call site and callee) into a
        global log that was processed lazily. Processing the log would give precise counts of call
        edges, and could be used to drive well-informed inlining decisions - polymorphic or not.
        This was a speed-up on throughput tests but a slow-down for latency tests. It was a net win
        nonetheless.
        
        Experience with this code shows three things. First, the call edge profiler is buggy and
        complex. It would take work to fix the bugs. Second, the call edge profiler incurs lots of
        overhead for latency code that we care deeply about. Third, it's not at all clear that
        having call edge counts for every possible callee is any better than just having call edge
        counts for the limited number of callees that an inline cache would catch.
        
        So, this patch removes the call edge profiler and replaces it with a polymorphic call inline
        cache. If we miss the basic call inline cache, we inflate the cache to be a jump to an
        out-of-line stub that cases on the previously known callees. If that misses again, then we
        rewrite that stub to include the new callee. We do this up to some number of callees. If we
        hit the limit then we switch to using a plain virtual call.
        
        Substantial speed-up on V8Spider; undoes the slow-down that the original call edge profiler
        caused. Might be a SunSpider speed-up (below 1%), depending on hardware.

        Web Inspector: ES6: Improved Console Format for Set and Map Objects (like Arrays)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122867

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add new Runtime.RemoteObject object subtypes for "map", "set", and "weakmap".

        Upgrade Runtime.ObjectPreview to include type/subtype information. Now,
        an ObjectPreview can be used for any value, in place of a RemoteObject,
        and not capture / hold a reference to the value. The value will be in
        the string description.

        Adding this information to ObjectPreview can duplicate some information
        in the protocol messages if a preview is provided, but simplifies
        previews, so that all the information you need for any RemoteObject
        preview is available. To slim messages further, make "overflow" and
        "properties" only available on previews that may contain properties.
        So, not primitives or null.

        Finally, for "Map/Set/WeakMap" add an "entries" list to the preview
        that will return previews with "key" and "value" properties depending
        on the collection type. To get live, non-preview objects from a
        collection, use Runtime.getCollectionEntries.

        In order to keep the WeakMap's values Weak the frontend may provide
        a unique object group name when getting collection entries. It may
        then release that object group, e.g. when not showing the WeakMap's
        values to the user, and thus remove the strong reference to the keys
        so they may be garbage collected.

        (JSC::WeakMapData::begin):

        * inspector/scripts/codegen/generator.py:
        Add another type with runtime casting.

        * inspector/InjectedScriptSource.js:
        - Implement getCollectionEntries to get a range of values from a
        collection. The non-Weak collections have an order to their keys (in
        order of added) so range'd gets are okay. WeakMap does not have an
        order, so only allow fetching a number of values.
        - Update preview generation to address the Runtime.ObjectPreview
        type changes.

        Copy non-current thread stacks before scanning them instead of scanning
        them in-place.

        This operation is uncommon (i.e., never in the web content process),
        and even in a stress test with 4 threads it only copies about 27kB,
        so I think the performance cost is OK.

        Scanning in-place requires a complex dance where we constrain our GC
        data structures not to use malloc, free, or any other interesting functions
        that might acquire locks. We've gotten this wrong many times in the past,
        and I just got it wrong again yesterday. Since this code path is rarely
        tested, I want it to just make sense, and not depend on or constrain the
        details of the rest of the GC heap's design.

        (JSC::MachineThreads::tryCopyOtherThreadStacks): The design here is that
        you do one pass over all the threads to compute their combined size,
        and then a second pass to do all the copying. In theory, the threads may
        grow in between passes, in which case you'll continue until the threads
        stop growing. In practice, you never continue.

        Web Inspector: Object Previews in the Console
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129204

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Update the very old, unused object preview code. Part of this comes from
        the earlier WebKit legacy implementation, and the Blink implementation.

        A RemoteObject may include a preview, if it is asked for, and if the
        RemoteObject is an object. Previews are a shallow (single level) list
        of a limited number of properties on the object. The previewed
        properties are always stringified (even if primatives). Previews are
        limited to just 5 properties or 100 indices. Previews are marked
        as lossless if they are a complete snapshot of the object.

        There is a path to make previews two levels deep, that is currently
        unused but should soon be used for tables (e.g. IndexedDB).

        * inspector/InjectedScriptSource.js:
        - Move some code off of InjectedScript to be generic functions
        usable by RemoteObject as well.
        - Update preview generation to use 

        * inspector/protocol/Runtime.json:
        - Add a new type, "accessor" for preview objects. This represents
        a getter / setter. We currently don't get the value.

        BytecodeGenerator::initializeCapturedVariable() sets a misleading value for the 5th operand of op_put_to_scope.
        <https://webkit.org/b/140743>

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        BytecodeGenerator::initializeCapturedVariable() was setting the 5th operand to
        op_put_to_scope to an inappropriate value (i.e. 0).  As a result, the execution
        of put_to_scope could store a wrong inferred value into the VariableWatchpointSet
        for which ever captured variable is at local index 0.  In practice, this turns
        out to be the local for the Arguments object.  In this reproduction case in the
        bug, the wrong inferred value written there is the boolean true.

        Subsequently, DFG compilation occurs and CreateArguments is emitted to first do
        a check of the local for the Arguments object.  But because that local has a
        wrong inferred value, the check always discovers a non-null value and we never
        actually create the Arguments object.  Immediately after this, an OSR exit
        occurs leaving the Arguments object local uninitialized.  Later on at arguments
        tear off, we run into a boolean true where we had expected to find an Arguments
        object, which in turn, leads to the crash.

        The fix is to:
        1. In the case where the resolveModeType is LocalClosureVar, change the
           5th operand of op_put_to_scope to be a boolean.  True means that the
           local var is watchable.  False means it is not watchable.  We no longer
           pass the local index (instead of true) and UINT_MAX (instead of false).

           This allows us to express more clearer in the code what that value means,
           as well as remove the redundant way of getting the local's identifier.
           The identifier is always the one passed in the 2nd operand. 

        2. Previously, though intuitively, we know that the watchable variable
           identifier should be the same as the one that is passed in operand 2, this
           relationship was not clear in the code.  By code analysis, I confirmed that 
           the callers of BytecodeGenerator::emitPutToScope() always use the same
           identifier for operand 2 and for filling out the ResolveScopeInfo from
           which we get the watchable variable identifier later.  I've changed the
           code to make this clear now by always using the identifier passed in
           operand 2.

        3. In the case where the resolveModeType is LocalClosureVar,
           initializeCapturedVariable() and emitPutToScope() will now query
           hasWatchableVariable() to determine if the local is watchable or not.
           Accordingly, we pass the boolean result of hasWatchableVariable() as
           operand 5 of op_put_to_scope.

        Also added some assertions.

        In the put_by_val_direct operation, we use JSObject::putDirect.

        This patch changes Identifier::asIndex() to return Optional<uint32_t>.
        It forces callers to check the value is index or not explicitly.
        Additionally, it checks toString-ed Identifier is index or not to choose putDirect / putDirectIndex.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        In the put_by_val_direct operation, we use JSObject::putDirect.
        However, it only accepts non-index property. For index property, we need to use JSObject::putDirectIndex.
        This patch changes Identifier::asIndex() to return Optional<uint32_t>.
        It forces callers to check the value is index or not explicitly.
        Additionally, it checks toString-ed Identifier is index or not to choose putDirect / putDirectIndex.

        Web Replay: code generator should take supplemental specifications and allow cross-framework references
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136312

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Some types are shared between replay inputs from different frameworks.
        Previously, these type declarations were duplicated in every input
        specification file in which they were used. This caused some type encoding
        traits to be emitted twice if used from WebCore inputs and WebKit2 inputs.

        This patch teaches the replay inputs code generator to accept multiple
        input specification files. Inputs can freely reference types from other
        frameworks without duplicating declarations.

        On the code generation side, the model could contain types and inputs from
        frameworks that are not the target framework. Only generate code for the
        target framework.

        To properly generate cross-framework type encoding traits, use
        Type.encoding_type_argument in more places, and add the export macro for WebCore
        and the Test framework.

        Adjust some tests so that enum coverage is preserved by moving the enum types
        into "Test" (the target framework for tests).

        ClosureCallStubRoutine no longer needs codeOrigin
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140659

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        Once upon a time, we would look for the CodeOrigin associated with a return PC. This search
        would start with the CodeBlock according to the caller frame's call frame header. But if the
        call was a closure call, the return PC would be inside some closure call stub. So if the
        CodeBlock search failed, we would search *all* closure call stub routines to see which one
        encompasses the return PC. Then, we would use the CodeOrigin stored in the stub routine
        object. This was all a bunch of madness, and we actually got rid of it - we now determine
        the CodeOrigin for a call frame using the encoded code origin bits inside the tag of the
        argument count.
        
        This patch removes the final vestiges of the madness:
        
        - Remove the totally unused method declaration for the thing that did the closure call stub
          search.
        
        - Remove the CodeOrigin field from the ClosureCallStubRoutine. Except for that crazy search
          that we no longer do, everyone else who finds a ClosureCallStubRoutine will find it via
          the CallLinkInfo. The CallLinkInfo also has the CodeOrigin, so we don't need this field
          anymore.

        Basic block start offsets should never be larger than end offsets in the control flow profiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140377

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        The bytecode generator will emit code more than once for some AST nodes. For instance, 
        the finally block of TryNode will emit two code paths for its finally block: one for 
        the normal path, and another for the path where an exception is thrown in the catch block. 
        
        This repeated code emission of the same AST node previously broke how the control 
        flow profiler computed text ranges of basic blocks because when the same AST node 
        is emitted multiple times, there is a good chance that there are ranges that span 
        from the end offset of one of these duplicated nodes back to the start offset of 
        the same duplicated node. This caused a basic block range to report a larger start 
        offset than end offset. This was incorrect. Now, when this situation is encountered 
        while linking a CodeBlock, the faulty range in question is ignored.

        DFG can call PutByValDirect for generic arrays
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140389

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Computed properties in object initializers (ES6) use the put_by_val_direct operation.
        However, current DFG asserts that put_by_val_direct is not used for the generic array,
        the assertion failure is raised.
        This patch allow DFG to use put_by_val_direct to generic arrays.

        And fix the DFG put_by_val_direct implementation for string properties.
        At first, put_by_val_direct is inteded to be used for spread elements.
        So the property keys were limited to numbers (indexes).
        But now, it's also used for computed properties in object initializers.

        Local JSArray* "keys" in objectConstructorKeys() is not marked during garbage collection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140348

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We used to read registers in MachineThreads::gatherFromCurrentThread(), but that is too late
        because those registers may have been spilled on the stack and replaced with other values by
        the time we call down to gatherFromCurrentThread().

        Now we get the register contents at the same place that we demarcate the current top of
        stack using the address of a local variable, in Heap::markRoots().  The register contents
        buffer is passed along with the demarcation pointer.  These need to be done at this level 
        in the call tree and no lower, as markRoots() calls various functions that visit object
        pointers that may be latter proven dead.  Any of those pointers that are left on the
        stack or in registers could be incorrectly marked as live if we scan the stack contents
        from a called function or one of its callees.  The stack demarcation pointer and register
        saving need to be done in the same function so that we have a consistent stack, active
        and spilled registers.

        Because we don't want to make unnecessary calls to get the register contents, we use
        a macro to allocated, and possibly align, the register structure and get the actual
        register contents.

        When parsing a single line cached function, use the lineStartOffset of the
        location where we found the cached function instead of the cached lineStartOffset.
        The cache location's lineStartOffset has not been adjusted for any possible
        containing functions.

        This change is not needed for multi-line cached functions.  Consider the
        single line source:

        function outer(){function inner1(){doStuff();}; (function inner2() {doMoreStuff()})()}

        The first parser pass, we parse and cache inner1() and inner2() with a lineStartOffset
        of 0.  Later when we parse outer() and find inner1() in the cache, SourceCode start
        character is at outer()'s outermost open brace.  That is what we should use for
        lineStartOffset for inner1().  When done parsing inner1() we set the parsing token
        to the saved location for inner1(), including the lineStartOffset of 0.  We need
        to use the value of lineStartOffset before we started parsing inner1().  That is
        what the fix does.  When we parse inner2() the lineStartOffset will be correct.

        For a multi-line function, the close brace is guaranteed to be on a different line
        than the open brace.  Hence, its lineStartOffset will not change with the change of
        the SourceCode start character

        Argument object created by "Function dot arguments" should use a clone of the argument values.
        <https://webkit.org/b/140093>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        After the change in <https://webkit.org/b/139827>, the dfg-tear-off-arguments-not-activation.js
        test will crash.  The relevant code which manifests the issue is as follows:

            function bar() {
                return foo.arguments;
            }

            function foo(p) {
                var x = 42;
                if (p)
                    return (function() { return x; });
                else
                    return bar();
            }

        In this case, foo() has no knowledge of bar() needing its LexicalEnvironment and
        has dead code eliminated the SetLocal that stores it into its designated local.
        In bar(), the factory for the Arguments object (for creating foo.arguments) tries
        to read foo's LexicalEnvironment from its designated lexicalEnvironment local,
        but instead, finds it to be uninitialized.  This results in a null pointer access
        which causes a crash.

        This can be resolved by having bar() instantiate a clone of the Arguments object
        instead, and populate its elements with values fetched directly from foo's frame.
        There's no need to reference foo's LexicalEnvironment (whether present or not).

        Web Inspector: purge PassRefPtr from Inspector code and use Ref for typed and untyped protocol objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140053

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch replaces uses of PassRefPtr with uses of RefPtr&& and WTF::move() in code
        related to Web Inspector. It also converts many uses of RefPtr to Ref where
        references are always non-null. These two refactorings have been combined since
        they tend to require similar changes to the code.

        Creation methods for subclasses of InspectorValue now return a Ref, and callsites
        have been updated to take a Ref instead of RefPtr.

        Builders for typed protocol objects now return a Ref. Since there is no implicit
        call to operator&, callsites now must explicitly call .release() to convert a
        builder object into the corresponding protocol object once required fields are set.
        Update callsites and use auto to eliminate repetition of longwinded protocol types.

        Tests for inspector protocol and replay inputs have been rebaselined.

        REGRESSION: Use of undefined CallFrame::ScopeChain value
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139533

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Removed CallFrame::scope() and CallFrame::setScope() and eliminated or changed
        all usages of these funcitons.  In some cases the scope is passed in or determined
        another way.  In some cases the scope is used to calculate other values.  Lastly
        were places where these functions where used that are no longer needed.  For
        example when making a call, the caller's ScopeChain was copied to the callee's
        ScopeChain.  This change no longer uses the ScopeChain call frame header slot.
        That slot will be removed in a future patch.

        JavaScript Control Flow Profiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137785

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch introduces a mechanism for JavaScriptCore to profile
        which basic blocks have executed. This mechanism will then be
        used by the Web Inspector to indicate which basic blocks
        have and have not executed.
        
        The profiling works by compiling in an op_profile_control_flow
        at the start of every basic block. Then, whenever this op code 
        executes, we know that a particular basic block has executed.
        
        When we tier up a CodeBlock that contains an op_profile_control_flow
        that corresponds to an already executed basic block, we don't
        have to emit code for that particular op_profile_control_flow
        because the internal data structures used to keep track of 
        basic block locations has already recorded that the corresponding
        op_profile_control_flow has executed.

        The StringImpl* -> Weak<JSString> cache used by the DOM bindings
        had a bug where the key could become a stale pointer if the cached
        JSString had its internal StringImpl atomicized.

        If a new StringImpl was then later constructed at the exact same
        address as the stale key, before the Weak<JSString> got booted out
        of the string cache, we'd now have a situation where asking the
        string cache for that key would return the old JSString.

        Solve this by not allowing JSString::toExistingAtomicString() to
        change the JSString's internal StringImpl unless it's resolving a
        rope string. (The StringImpl nullity determines rope state.)

        This means that calling toExistingAtomicString() may now have to
        query the AtomicString table on each call rather than just once.
        All clients of this API would be forced to do this regardless,
        since they return value will be used to key into containers with
        AtomicStringImpl* keys.

        No test because this relies on malloc putting two StringImpls
        at the same address at different points in time and we have no
        mechanism to reliably test that.

        Split out FunctionNode from FunctionBodyNode

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This is step toward a parser speedup.

        We used to use FunctionBodyNode for two different purposes:

        (1) "I am the root function you are currently parsing";

        (2) "I am a lazy record of a nested function, which you will parse later".

        This made for awkward lifetime semantics and interfaces.

        Now, case (1) is handled by FunctionBodyNode, and case (2) is handled by
        a new node named FunctionNode.

        Since case (1) no longer needs to handle being the root of the parse
        tree, FunctionBodyNode can be a normal arena-allocated node.

        Web Inspector: timeline probe records have inaccurate per-probe hit counts

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Previously, the DebuggerAgent was responsible for assigning unique ids to samples.
        However, this makes it impossible for the frontend's Timeline manager to associate
        a Probe Sample timeline record with the corresponding probe sample data. The record
        only included the probe batchId (misnamed as hitCount in ScriptDebugServer).

        This patch moves both the batchId and sampleId counters into ScriptDebugServer, so
        any client of ScriptDebugListener will get the correct sampleId for each sample.

        The parser should allocate all pieces of the AST

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        This is a step toward a 14% parsing speedup.

        Previously, allocation was split between the parser and certain node
        constructor functions. This made for some duplicated code and circular
        dependencies.

        * parser/ASTBuilder.h:
        (JSC::ASTBuilder::createGetterOrSetterProperty): No need to pass through
        the VM, since our callee no longer needs to allocate anything.

        (JSC::ASTBuilder::createProperty): Allocate the identifier for our
        callee, since that is simpler than requiring our callee to notice that
        we didn't do so, and do it for us.

        (JSC::ASTBuilder::createForInLoop): Allocate the DeconstructingAssignmentNode
        for our callee, since that is simpler than requiring our callee to notice
        that we didn't do so, and do it for us.

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        Add constructors for Identifier taking AtomicString and AtomicStringImpl.
        This avoids branching on the string's isAtomic flag, which is obviously
        always true for AtomicString & AtomicStringImpl.

        Had to add a Identifier(const char*) constructor to resolve implicit
        ambiguity between String / AtomicString.

        Also made PrivateName::uid() return AtomicStringImpl* to take advantage
        of the new constructor in a few places.

        Add Heap verification infrastructure.
        <https://webkit.org/b/138851>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The verification infrastructure code is always built in but disabled by
        default.  When disabled, the cost is minimal:
        1. Heap has a m_verifier field.
        2. GC does a few "if (m_verifier)" checks that should fail.
        3. HeapVerifier takes up code space though not used.

        When enabled:
        1. The HeapVerifier will keep N number of GC cycle data.
           Each GC cycle will contain a "before marking" and "after marking" live
           object list.
           The GC cycles is a circular buffer.  Only data for the last N GC cycles
           will be retained.
        2. During GC, the current GC cycle's live objects lists will be populated
           before and after marking.
        3. The current GC cycle's live object lists will be validated before GC,
           after marking, and after GC.

        Currently, the only validation being done is to verify that object
        butterflies are allocated from valid blocks in the Storage (aka Copied)
        space.

        In the DFG, we have a ConstantFolding phase that occurs after all LocalCSE
        phases have already transpired.  Hence, Identity nodes introduced in the
        ConstantFolding phase will be left in the node graph.  Subsequently, the
        DFG code generator asserts that CSE phases have consumed all Identity nodes.
        This turns out to not be true.  Hence, the crash.  We fix this by teaching
        the DFG code generator to emit code for Identity nodes.

        Unlike the DFG, the FTL does not have this issue.  That is because the FTL
        plan has GlobalCSE phases that come after ConstantFolding and any other
        phases that can generate Identity nodes.  Hence, for the FTL, it is true that
        CSE will consume all Identity nodes, and the code generator should not see any
        Identity nodes.

        This is the counterpart of r176083 for the str instruction.

        I believe this code is currently unreachable because there is only one client of strh()
        in the MacroAssembler and it always setup the scale explicitely.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The existing code requires that each MacroAssembler implementation provide
        their own copy of all of the probe implementations even when most of it is
        identical.  This patch hoists the common parts into AbstractMacroAssembler
        (with some minor renaming).  Each target specific MacroAssembler now only
        need to implement a few target specific methods that are expected by and
        documented in AbstractMacroAssembler.h in the ENABLE(MASM_PROBE) section.

        In this patch, I also simplified the X86 and X86_64 ports to use the same
        port implementation.  The ARMv7 probe implementation should not conditionally
        exclude the higher FP registers (since the JIT doesn't).  Fixed the ARMv7
        probe code to include the higher FP registers always. 

        This is all done in preparation to add printing functionality in JITted code
        for debugging.

        ARMv7(s) Assembler: LDRH with immediate offset is loading from the wrong offset
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136914

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        TLDR: the immediate offset of half-word load was divided by 2.

        Story time: So I started getting those weird reports of :nth-child() behaving bizarrely
        on ARMv7 and ARMv7s. To make things worse, the behavior changes depending on style updates.

        I started looking the disassembly on the tests cases...

        The first thing I noticed was that the computation of An+B looked wrong. For example,
        in the case of n+6, the instruction should have been:
            subs r1, r1, #6
        but was
            subs r1, r1, #2

        After spending a lot of time trying to find the error in the assembler, I discovered
        the problem was not real, but just a bug in the disassembler.
        This is the first fix: ARMv7DOpcodeAddSubtractImmediate3's immediate3() was truncating
        the value to 2 bits instead of 3 bits.

        The disassembler being fixed, I still have no lead on the weird bug. Some disassembly later,
        I realize the LDRH instruction is not decoded at all. The reason is that both LDRH and STRH
        were under the umbrella ARMv7DOpcodeLoadStoreRegisterImmediateHalfWord but the pattern
        only matched SRTH.

        I fix that next, ARMv7DOpcodeLoadStoreRegisterImmediateHalfWord is split into
        ARMv7DOpcodeStoreRegisterImmediateHalfWord and ARMv7DOpcodeLoadRegisterImmediateHalfWord,
        each with their own pattern and their instruction group.

        Now that I can see the LDRHs correctly, there is something fishy about them, their offset
        is way too small for the data I load.

        This time, looking at the binary, the generated code is indeed incorrect. It turns out that
        the ARMv7 assembler shifted the offset of half-word load as if they were byte load: divided by 4.
        As a result, all the load of half-words with more than zero offset were loading
        values with a smaller offset than what they should have.

        That being fixed, I dump the assembly: still wrong. I am ready to throw my keyboard through
        my screen at that point.

        Looking at the disassembler, there is yet again a bug. The computation of the scale() adjustment
        of the offset was incorrect for anything but word loads.
        I replaced it by a switch-case to make it explicit.

        STRH is likely incorrect too. I'll fix that in a follow up, I want to survey all the 16 bits cases
        that are not directly used by the CSS JIT.

        the codeBlock signals need of activation. Also, even if codeBlock
        signals the use of arguments, the unmodifiedArgumentsRegister may not be
        initialized yet (neither locally nor in lexicalEnvironment).

        If codeBlock()->needsActivation() is false, unmodifiedArgumentsRegister
        is already checked for Undefined. This patch applies the same check when
        the condition is true (and also checks whether
        callFrame()->hasActivation()).

        The JIT should cache property lookup misses.
        <https://webkit.org/b/135578>

        Add support for inline caching of missed property lookups.
        Previously this would banish us to C++ slow path.

        It's implemented as a simple GetById cache that returns jsUndefined()
        as long as the Structure chain check passes. There's no DFG exploitation
        of this knowledge in this patch.

        PutById inline caches should have a store barrier when it triggers a structure transition.
        <https://webkit.org/b/138441>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        After r174025, we no longer insert DFG store barriers when the payload of a
        PutById operation is not a cell.  However, this can lead to a crash when we have
        PutById inline cache code transitioning the structure and re-allocating the
        butterfly of an old gen object.  The lack of a store barrier in that inline
        cache results in the old gen object not being noticed during an eden GC scan.
        As a result, its newly allocated butterfly will not be kept alive, which leads
        to a stale butterfly pointer and, eventually, a crash.

        It is also possible that the new structure can be collected by the eden GC if
        (at GC time):
        1. It is in the eden gen.
        2. The inline cache that installed it has been evicted.
        3. There are no live eden gen objects referring to it.

        The chances of this should be more rare than the butterfly re-allocation, but
        it is still possible.  Hence, the fix is to always add a store barrier if the
        inline caches performs a structure transition.

        Rename checkMarkByte() to jumpIfIsRememberedOrInEden().
        <https://webkit.org/b/138369>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Write barriers are needed for GC Eden collections so that we can scan pointers
        pointing from old generation objects to eden generation objects.  The barrier
        currently checks the mark byte in a cell to see if we should skip adding the
        cell to the GC remembered set.  The addition should be skipped if:

        1. The cell is in the young generation.  It has no old to eden pointers by
           definition.
        2. The cell is already in the remembered set.  While it is ok to add the cell
           to the GC remembered set more than once, it would be redundant.  Hence,
           we skip this as an optimization to avoid doing unnecessary work.

        The barrier currently names this check as checkMarkByte().  We should rename it
        to jumpIfIsRememberedOrInEden() to be clearer about its intent.

        Similarly, Jump results of this check are currently named
        ownerNotMarkedOrAlreadyRemembered.  This can be misinterpreted as the owner is
        not marked or not already remembered.  We should rename it to
        ownerIsRememberedOrInEden which is clearer about the intent of the
        check.  What we are really checking for is that the cell is in the eden gen,
        which is implied by it being "not marked".

        Update scope related slow path code to use scope register added to opcodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138254

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Updated slow paths for op_pop_scope, op_push_name_scope and op_push_with_scope.
        Added scope register index parameter to the front of the relevant argument lists of the
        slow functions.  In the case of op_push_name_scope for x86 (32 bit), there aren't enough
        registers to accomodate all the parameters.  Therefore, added two new JSVALUE32_64 slow
        paths called operationPushCatchScope() and operationPushFunctionNameScope() to eliminate
        the last "type" argument.

        Web Inspector: Generate ObjC inspector protocol types and alternate dispatcher interfaces
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138048

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        Generate Objective-C interfaces for inspector protocol types, command, and event dispatchers.
        This is very much like the InspectorProtocolTypes, BackendDispatchers, and FrontendDispatchers,
        but with an ObjC spin on things.

        The private API that clients would use is all encapsulated in RWIProtocol.h. It includes the
        types interfaces, command handler protocol, and event dispatcher interface. Where possible the
        API uses real enums, which hides the raw protocol enum strings from clients.

        Inspector protocol types are, like InspectorProtocolObjects, built on top of an InspectorObject.
        This offers the flexibilty of adding arbitrary key/values using the RWIProtocolJSONObject
        interface, which may be required for certain protocol objects like "Network.Headers" which
        have no fields, but expect arbitrary properties to be added.

        Command handler protocols always have two callbacks. An error callback and a success callback.
        The signature is very much like BackendDispatchers. In parameters are passed directly to
        the selectors, and out parameters are defined by the success callback. It will be the client's
        responsibility to call either of these callbacks to complete handling of a request.

        Event dispatcher interfaces are straight forward, just packaging up the arguments and sending
        the message to the frontend.

        ObjC <-> Protocol conversion happens in each of the generated files. In type getters / setters,
        in commands parameters and event parameters. For this to work we generate conversion helpers
        for all enums, ObjC enum <-> protocol strings. For NSArray <-> InspectorArray there are some
        static helpers to do the conversions. We do lose some type safety in these conversions.

        Use plain JSArray for RegExp matches instead of a lazily populated custom object.
        <https://webkit.org/b/138191>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        We're already offering two RegExp matching APIs, one that collects subpattern
        matches (exec), and one that simply tests for a match (test).
        Given that, it was pretty overkill to lazily populate the resulting array of
        matches, since the user could simply use test() if they didn't need them.

        This allows the JIT to generate better code for RegExp match arrays, and also
        enables some fast paths in the JSC runtime that check if an object isJSArray().

        Looks like ~1.5% improvement on Octane/regexp according to run-jsc-benchmarks.

        Crash when attempting to perform array iteration on a non-array with numeric keys not initialized.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137814>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The arrayIteratorNextThunkGenerator() thunk was not checking for the case where
        the butterfly may be NULL.  This was the source of the crash, and is now fixed.

        In addition, it is also not checking for the case where a property named "length"
        may have been set on the iterated object.  The thunk only checks the butterfly's
        publicLength for its iteration operation.  Array objects will work fine with this
        because it always updates its butterfly's publicLength when its length changes.
        In the case of iterable non-Array objects, the "length" property will require a
        look up outside of the scope of this thunk.  The fix is simply to limit the fast
        case checks in this thunk to Array objects.

        Simplified some JSObject methods for converting arrays to ArrayStorage shape.

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Currently, for each Undecided, Int32, Double, and Contiguous array shapes,
        there are 3 JSObject methods to convert them to ArrayStorage shape:
            ArrayStorage* convert<shape>ToArrayStorage(VM&, NonPropertyTransition, unsigned neededLength);
            ArrayStorage* convert<shape>ToArrayStorage(VM&, NonPropertyTransition);
            ArrayStorage* convert<shape>ToArrayStorage(VM&);

        However, the neededLength that is passed is always m_butterfly->vectorLength().
        Hence, the method that takes a neededLength is really not needed.  This patch
        removes this unneeded verbosity.

        Refactoring to simplify some code in DatePrototype.cpp.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137997>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        A bunch of functions in DatePrototype.cpp have the pattern of loading a
        constant into a local variable only to pass it to a callee function
        immediately after.  There is no other use for that variable.  This adds
        additional verbosity with no added benefit.

        This patch refactors those functions to just pass the constant arg directly.

        By definition of calculateLocalTimeOffset, input time should be UTC time.
        But there are many cases when input time is based on local time.
        So, it gives erroneous results while calculating offset of DST boundary time.
        By adding a argument to distinguish UTC and local time, we can get the correct offset.

        Web Replay: code generator shouldn't complain about enums without a storage type if they are in an enclosing scope
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137084

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        In order to generate encode/decode method declarations without pulling in lots of headers,
        the generator must forward declare enums (for enum classes or enums with explicit sizes).

        Change the generator to not require an explicit size if an enum is declared inside a struct
        or class definition. In that case, it must pull in headers since scoped enums can't be
        forward declared.

        This patch also fixes some chained if-statements that should be if-else statements.

        Test: updated replay/scripts/tests/generate-enum-encoding-helpers.json to cover the new case.

        Web Process crash when starting the web inspector after r174025.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137340>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        After r174025, we can generate a bad graph in the DFG fixup phase like so:

            102:<!0:-> StoreBarrier(Check:KnownCell:@19, ..., bc#44)
            60:<!0:->  PutStructure(Check:KnownCell:@19, ..., bc#44)
            103:<!0:-> Check(Check:NotCell:@54, ..., bc#44)
                    // ^-- PutByOffset's StoreBarrier has been elided and replaced
                    //     with a speculation check which can OSR exit.
            61:<!0:->  PutByOffset(Check:KnownCell:@19, ..., bc#44)

        As a result, the structure change will get executed even if we end up OSR
        exiting before the PutByOffset.  In the baseline JIT code, the structure now
        erroneously tells the put operation that there is a value in that property
        slot when it is actually uninitialized (hence, the crash).

        The fix is to insert the Check at the earliest point possible:

        1. If the checked node is in the same bytecode as the PutByOffset, then
           the earliest point where we can insert the Check is right after the
           checked node.

        2. If the checked node is from a preceding bytecode (before the PutByOffset),
           then the earliest point where we can insert the Check is at the start
           of the current bytecode.

        Also reverted the workaround from r174749: https://webkit.org/b/137758.

        Benchmark results appear to be a wash on aggregate.

        This change brings up the conversion rate from ProfileType to Check 
        or CheckStructrue from ~45% to ~65%. This change also speeds the 
        type profiler up significantly: consistently between 2x-20x faster.

        Rework the way we track |arguments| references so that we don't try
        to use the |arguments| reference on the stack if it's not safe.

        To do this without nuking performance it was necessary to update
        the parser to track modification of the |arguments| reference
        itself.

        Ensure that inline assembly Thunk functions don't conflict with the section designations of the compiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137434

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        The ARM64 version of the defineUnaryDoubleOpWrapper macro in
        ThunkGenerators.cpp contains inline assembly with .text assembler
        directive followed by a static variable declaration. This macro gets
        expanded several times afterwards, however, only during the compilation
        of the first expansion does gcc insert a .data assembler directive
        before the assembled version of the static variable. Thus, only the
        first variable gets allocated in the .data section, all the others
        remain in .text. If JavaScriptCore is built as a shared library then
        this causes a segmentation fault during dynamic linking.

        This patch puts a .previous directive at the end of the inline assembly
        to ensure that the assumptions of the compiler about the sections are
        not broken and the following variable goes to the right place.

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        Fairly simple change.  If we have a lexical record we need to pull the unmodified
        arguments object from the record and then use the standard op_tear_off_arguments
        instruction on the temporary.
