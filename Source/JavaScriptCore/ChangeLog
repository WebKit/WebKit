            JavaScriptCore ArrayPrototype::join shouldn't cache butterfly when it makes effectful calls
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155776

            Reviewed by Saam Barati.

            Array.join ends up calling toString, possibly on some object.  Since these calls
            could be effectful and could change the array itself, we can't hold the butterfly
            pointer while making effectful calls.  Changed the code to fall back to the general
            case when an effectful toString() call might be made.

            Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

            The DFG's use of watchpoints for havingABadTime goes back a long time. We introduced this feature
            when we first introduced watchpoints. That left it open to a lot of bitrot. On top of that, this
            code doesn't get tested much because having a bad time is not something that is really supposed to
            happen.

            Well, now I've got reports that it does happen - or at least, we know that it is because of
            crashes in an assertion that could only be triggered if a bad time was had. In the meantime, we
            added two new features without adequately testing havingABadTime: concurrent JIT and FTL.
            Concurrency means that we have to worry about the havingABadTime watchpoint triggering during
            compilation. FTL means that we have new code and new optimizations that needs to deal with this
            feature correctly.

            The bug can arise via race condition or just goofy profiling. As in the newly added test, we could
            first profile an allocation thinking that it will allocate sane arrays. Then we might have a bad
            time, and then compile that function with the FTL. The ByteCodeParser will represent the
            allocation with a NewArray node that has a sane indexingType(). But when we go to lower the Node,
            we observe that the Structure* that the JSGlobalObject tells us to use has a different indexing
            type. This is a feature of havingABadTime that the DFG knew about, but the FTL didn't. The FTL
            didn't know about it because we didn't have adequate tests, and this code rarely gets triggered in
            the wild. So, the FTL had a silly assertion that the indexing types match. They absolutely don't
            have to match.

            There is another bug, a race condition, that remains even if we remove the bad assertion. We set
            the havingABadTime watchpoint late in compilation, and we do it based on whether the watchpoint is
            still OK. This means that we could parse a function before we have a bad time and then do
            optimizations (for example in AbstractInterpreter) like proving that the structure set associated
            with the value returned by the NewArray is the one with a sane indexing type. Then, after those
            optimizations have already been done, we will go to set the watchpoint. But just as we are doing
            this, we could haveABadTime on the main thread. Currently this sort of almost works because
            having a bad time requires doing a GC, and we can't GC until the watchpoint collection phase. But
            that feels too fragile. So, this phase moves the setting of the watchpoint to the FixupPhase. This
            is consistent with our long-term goal of removing the WatchpointCollectionPhase. Moving this to
            FixupPhase means that we set the watchpoint before doing any optimizations. So, if having a bad
            time happens before the FixupPhase then all optimizations will agree that we're having a bad time
            and so everything is fine; if we have a bad time after FixupPhase then we will cancel the
            compilation anyway.

            Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

            This patch fixes PutStackSinkingPhase to no longer escape the stack
            locations that LoadVarargs and ForwardVarargs write to. We used
            to consider sinking PutStacks right before a LoadVarargs/ForwardVarargs
            because we considered them uses of such stack locations. They aren't
            uses of those stack locations, they unconditionally write to those
            stack locations. Sinking PutStacks to these nodes was not needed before,
            but seemed mostly innocent. But I ran into a problem with this while implementing
            FTL try/catch where we would end up having to generate a value for a sunken PutStack
            right before a LoadVarargs. This would cause us to issue a GetStack that loaded garbage that
            was then forwarded into a Phi that was used as the source as the PutStack. This caused the
            abstract interpreter to confuse itself on type information for the garbage GetStack
            that was fed into the Phi, which would cause the abstract interpreter to then claim
            that the basic block with the PutStack in it would never be reached. This isn't true, the
            block would indeed be reached. The solution here is to be more precise about the
            liveness of locals w.r.t LoadVarargs and ForwardVarargs.

            Web Inspector: Reduce list of saved console messages
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151225

            Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

            Inspector saves messages so that when an inspector frontend opens it can report
            these messages to the frontend. However we were saving a rather large list of
            1000 messages. Most pages do not produce a large number of console messages.
            However pages that live for a long time can generate many errors over time,
            especially periodic engine issues such as cross-origin access errors. This could
            result in a lot of wasted memory for console messages that may never be used.

            Likewise when an inspector first open sending all 1000 messages to the frontend
            results in a poor experience.

            Lets reduce the list of saved messages. Developer will still be able to see
            all messages as long as they have Web Inspector open at the time the messages
            are generated.

            * inspector/agents/InspectorConsoleAgent.cpp:
            Reduce the list from 1000 to 100. Also, when expiring

            Web Inspector: no need to allocate protocolErrors array for every dispatched backend command
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146466

            Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

            Clean up some of the backend dispatcher code, with a focus on eliminating useless allocations
            of objects in the common case when no protocol errors happen. This is done by saving the
            current id of each request as it is being processed by the backend dispatcher, and tagging any
            subsequent errors with that id. This also means we don't have to thread the requestId except
            in the async command code path.

            This patch also lifts some common code shared between all generated backend command
            implementatations into the per-domain dispatch method instead. This reduces generated code size.

            To be consistent, this patch standardizes on calling the id of a backend message its 'requestId'.
            Requests can be handled synchronously or asynchronously (triggered via the 'async' property).

            No new tests, covered by existing protocol tests.

            Reviewed by Brian Burg.

            Bug #145995 changed the starting offset of a function to
            be the open parenthesis of the function's parameter list.
            This broke JSC's type profiler protocol of communicating
            return types of a function to the web inspector. This
            is now fixed. The text offset used in the protocol is now
            the first letter of the function/get/set/method name.
            So "f" in "function a() {}", "s" in "set foo(){}", etc.

            StackOverflow stack unwinding should stop at native frames.
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148749

            Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

            In the present code, after ping-pong'ing back and forth between native and JS
            code a few times, if we have a stack overflow on re-entry into the VM to run
            JS code's whose stack frame would overflow the JS stack, the code will end up
            unwinding past the native function that is making the call to re-enter the VM.
            As a result, any clean up code (e.g. destructors for stack variables) in the
            skipped native function frame (and its chain of native function callers) will
            not be called.

            This patch is based on the Michael Saboff's fix of this issue landed on the
            jsc-tailcall branch: http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/188555

            We now check for the case where there are no JS frames to unwind since the
            last native frame, and treat the exception as an unhandled exception.  The
            native function is responsible for further propagating the exception if needed.

            Other supporting work:
            1. Remove vm->vmEntryFrameForThrow.  It should always be the same as
               vm->topVMEntryFrame.
            2. Change operationThrowStackOverflowError() to use the throwStackOverflowError()
               helper function instead of rolling its own.
            3. Added a test that exercises this edge case.  The test should not hang or crash.

            MarkedBlock::allocateBlock will have the wrong allocation size when (sizeof(MarkedBlock) + bytes) is divisible by WTF::pageSize()
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148500

            Reviewed by Mark Lam.

            Consider the following scenario:
            - On OS X, WTF::pageSize() is 4*1024 bytes.
            - JSEnvironmentRecord::allocationSizeForScopeSize(6621) == 53000
            - sizeof(MarkedBlock) == 248
            - (248 + 53000) is a multiple of 4*1024.
            - (248 + 53000)/(4*1024) == 13

            We will allocate a chunk of memory of size 53248 bytes that looks like this:
            0            248       256                       53248       53256
            [Marked Block | 8 bytes |  payload     ......      ]  8 bytes  |
                                    ^                                      ^
                               Our Environment record starts here.         ^
                                                                           ^
                                                                     Our last JSValue in the environment record will go from byte 53248 to 53256. But, we don't own this memory.

            We need to ensure that we round up sizeof(MarkedBlock) to an
            atomSize boundary. We need to do this because the first atom
            inside the MarkedBlock will start at the rounded up multiple
            of atomSize past MarkedBlock. If we end up with an allocation
            that is perfectly aligned to the page size, then we will be short
            8 bytes (in the current implementation where atomSize is 16 bytes,
            and MarkedBlock is 248 bytes).

            DFG::ArgumentsEliminationPhase should emit a PutStack for all of the GetStacks that the ByteCodeParser emitted
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147433

            Ideally, the ByteCodeParser would only emit SetArgument nodes for named arguments.  But
            currently that's not what it does - it emits a SetArgument for every argument that a varargs
            call may pass.  Each SetArgument gets turned into a GetStack.  This means that if
            ArgumentsEliminationPhase optimizes away PutStacks for those varargs arguments that didn't
            get passed or used, we get degenerate IR where we have a GetStack of something that didn't
            have a PutStack.

            This fixes the bug by removing the code to optimize away PutStacks in
            ArgumentsEliminationPhase.

            Fixed VM pool allocation should have a reserve for allocations that cannot fail
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147154

            This adds the notion of a JIT pool reserve fraction. Some fraction, currently 1/4, of
            the JIT pool is reserved for allocations that cannot fail. It makes sense to make this
            a fraction rather than a constant because each allocation that can fail may cause some
            number of allocations that cannot fail (for example, the OSR exit thunks that we
            compile when we exit from some CodeBlock cannot fail).

            I've tested this by adding a test mode where we artificially limit the JIT pool size.
            Prior to the fix, we had >20 failures. Now we have none.
