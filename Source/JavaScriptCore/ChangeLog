            REGRESSION(186691): OSR entry is broken on loop headers that have no live variables

            The OSR entry must-handle block/value widening introduced in r186691 would cause the
            CFA to reexecute if it caused any live local variables to change value. But this fails
            if the must-handle block has no live local variables, and the entry block otherwise
            appears to be unreachable.

            This fixes the bug by having the change detection include whether the block hadn't been
            visited in addition to whether any local variable values got widened.

            RegExp::match() should set m_state to ByteCode if compilation fails.
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147023

            Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

            A RegExp has a YarrCodeBlock that has 4 MacroAssemblerCodeRefs for compiled code.
            If one of these compilations succeeds, RegExp::m_state will be set to JITCode.
            Subsequently, if RegExp tries to compile another one of these but fails, m_state
            will be left untouched i.e. it still says JITCode.  As a result, when
            RegExp::match() later tries to execute the non-existant compiled code, it will
            crash.

            The fix is to downgrade m_state to ByteCode if RegExp ever fails to compile.
            This failure should be rare.  We'll do the minimal work here to fix the issue and
            keep an eye on the perf bots.  If perf regresses, we can do some optimization work then.

            This issue is difficult to test for since it either requires a low memory condition
            to trigger a failed RegExp compilation at the right moment, or for the RegExp to
            succeed compilation in the MatchedOnly mode but fail in IncludeSubpatterns mode.
            Instead, I manually tested it by instrumenting RegExp::compile() to fail once in every
            10 compilation attempts.

            DFG fragile frozen values are fundamentally broken
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146602

            Reviewed by Mark Lam.

            This change gets rid of the FragileValue value strength, because it was fundamentally
            broken.

            FragileValue was a value known to the compiler but not tracked by the GC in any way -
            it wasn't marked and it wasn't weak. This was used to support AI bootstrap for OSR
            must-handle values. The philosophy was that if the compiler did use the value for
            optimization, it would have been strengthened to a weak value (or maybe even a strong
            value, though we probably won't do that). But this was too much of a pipe dream. I've
            found at least one case where the compiler did use the value, but never strengthened
            it: it would happen if the value ended up in an OSR entry data expected value. Then if
            we GCed, we might have killed the value, but OSR entry would still try to use it for
            validation. That might have sort of just worked, but it's clearly shady.

            The reason why we made must-handle values fragile and not weak is that most of the time
            the values disappear from the abstract state: they are LUBed to a non-constant. If we
            kept them around as weak, we'd have too many cases of the GC killing the code because
            it thought that the value was somehow meaningful to the code when it was only used as a
            temporary artifact of optimization.

            So, it's true that it's very important for must-handle values not to automatically be
            weak or strong. It's also true that the values are necessary for AI bootstrap because
            we need to know what values OSR entry will require. But we shouldn't accomplish these
            goals by having the compiler hold onto what are essentially dangling pointers.

            This implements a better solution: instead of having InPlaceAbstractState bootstrap the
            AI with must-handle values at the beginning, we now widen the valuesAtHead of the
            must-handle block after AI converges. This widening is done in CFAPhase. This allows us
            to see if the must-handle values are necessary at all. In most cases, the widening
            takes a non-constant abstract value and simply amends something to its type based on
            the type of the must-handle value, and so the must-handle value never actually shows up
            in either the IR or any abstract value. In the unlikely event that the value at head is
            bottom, we freeze the must-handle value. This change removes FragileValue, and this
            freezing uses WeakValue as the strength. That makes sense: since the abstract value was
            bottom, the must-handle value becomes integral to the IR and so it makes no sense for
            the GC to keep the resulting CodeBlock alive if that must-handle value dies. This will
            sometimes happen for example if you have a very long-running loop whose pre-header
            allocates some object, but that pre-header appears to always exit to the optimizing JIT
            because it was only profiled once in the LLInt and that profiling appears insufficient
            to the DFG. In that case, we'll effectively constant-fold the references to the object
            inside the loop, which is both efficient (yay constant folding!) and necessary
            (otherwise we wouldn't know what the type of the variable should have been).

            Testing and debugging this is complicated. So, this adds some new capabilities:

            - DFG IR dumps also dump all of the FrozenValues that point to the heap along with
              their strengths, so that it's easy to see what GC objects the DFG feels are necessary
              for the compilation.

            - DFG OSR entry preparation prints out the OSR entry data structures, so that it's easy
              to see what GC pointers (and other things) are used for OSR entry validation. The
              printouts are quite detailed, and should also help other kinds of OSR entry
              debugging.

            - DFG::Plan now validates whether all of the GC pointers planted in the various JITCode
              data structures are also properly registered as either weak or strong pointers in the
              CodeBlock. This validation check previously failed due to fragile values ending up in
              the OSR entry data structures, both in the newly added test (dead-osr-entry-value.js)
              and in some pre-existing tests (like earley-boyer and 3d-raytrace).

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        When we capture an argument by name and we use "arguments", we put all of the
        arguments into the scope.  But destructured arguments are put into the scope
        anonymously i.e. the SymbolTable knows that the scope offset is in use via
        SymbolTable::m_maxScopeOffset, but that ScopeOffset won't appear in
        SymbolTable::m_map.

        The SymbolTable's m_localToEntry vector is synthesized from its m_map, and will
        have a size which is based on the largest ScopeOffset in the m_map.  If we have a
        scenario where the anonymous argument is at a higher ScopeOffset than all the
        named arguments, then the m_localsToEntry vector will not have an entry for it
        i.e. the m_localsToEntry vector will have a size that is <= the ScopeOffset of
        the anonymous argument.

        Hence, SymbolTable::entryFor() should ensure that the requested ScopeOffset is
        within the bounds of the m_localToEntry vector before indexing into it.

        OSR exit fuzzing should allow us to select a static exit site
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146601

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        The original implementation of the fuzzer allows us to trigger an exit based on its index
        in the dynamic sequence of exit sites encountered. But there are usually millions of
        dynamically encountered exit sites, even if the program only has thousands of static exit
        sites. That means that we would at best be able to do a random sampling of exits, and
        those would be biased to the hottest exit sites.
        
        This change allows us to also select exit sites based on their index in the static
        sequence of exit sites that the compiler compiled. Then, once that static exit site is
        selected, we can select which dynamic exit at that exit site we should trigger. Since the
        number of static exit sites is usually smallish (it's bounded by program size), we can do
        an exhaustive search over all exit sites in most programs.

        JSC's parser should follow the ES6 spec with respect to parsing Declarations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146621

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        There were a few locations where JSC would allow declaration statements
        in incorrect ways. JSC didn't distinguish between 'Statement' and
        'StatementListItem' grammar productions. The relevant grammar is here:
        http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-statements

        From the ECMA Script 6.0 spec:
        1. Section 13.6 The if Statement (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-if-statement) 
         says that IfStatements only takes Statements for the "then-else" clauses, not StatementListItems.
         (Same with 'while/for/do-while' loop bodies).
        2. Section 13 ECMAScript Language: Statements and Declarations 
         (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations)
         defines the syntax of Statements, and they do not include ClassDeclarations and LexicalDeclarations 
         (const, let, see 13.3.1 Let and Const Declarations).
         Declarations can only be in the “then-else” clauses when embedded in a StatementListItem in a BlockStatement (see 13.2).

        Hence, the following style of declarations are no longer allowed:
            'if/for/while (condition) const x = 40;'
            'if/for/while (condition) class C { }'

        Instead, we mandate such declaration constructs are within a StatementList 
       (which is the production that JSC's Parser::parseSourceElements function parses):
           'if/for/while (condition) { const x = 40; }'
           'if/for/while (condition) { class C { } }'

        Relax builtin JS restriction about try-catch
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146555

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        When retrieving the captured variables from the full activated scope,
        it swapped the given vector with the stored declared variables vector.
        This is because retrieving the captured variables are executed in the
        last sequence of the parser, so declared variables are no longer used.
        However, in builtins functions case, after retrieving the captured
        variables, we check the variables by using declared variables vector.
        So at that time, the declared variables vector becomes empty and it
        raises assertion failures when the builtins function contains the full
        activated scope. try-catch's catch scope requires the upper scope full
        activated, so JS code in the builtins cannot use the try-catch.

        This patch relaxes this restriction. When retrieving the captured
        variables from the scope, just copy to the given vector.

        This fixes weird concurrency bugs where the constant folding phase tries to convert
        something to a constant but then crashes because the constant's structure wasn't
        registered. The AI was registering the structure of any value it saw, but constant folding
        wasn't - and that's fine so long as there ain't no concurrency.
        
        The best fix is to just make it impossible to introduce a constant into the IR without
        registering its structure. That's what this change does. This is not only a great
        concurrency fix - it also makes the compiler somewhat easier to hack on because it's one
        less case of structure registering that you have to remember about.

        Since we cannot blacklist the system memcpy we must use our own naive implementation,
        copyMemory. This is not a significant performance loss as tryCopyOtherThreadStack is
        only called as part of an O(heapsize) operation. As the heap is generally much larger

        The filter() method returns Contradiction only when a value *becomes* clear. This is
        necessary for supporting the convention that non-JSValue nodes have a bottom proved
        type. (We should fix that convention eventually, but for now let's just be consistent
        about it.)

        Crash on gog.com due to PolymorphicCallNode's having stale references to CallLinkInfo
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146285

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        CallLinkInfo's contain a RefPtr to a PolymorphicCallStubRoutine, named stub, which contains
        a collection of PolymorphicCallNode.  Those PolymorphicCallNodes have a reference back to the
        CallLinkInfo.  When a CallLinkInfo replaces or clears "stub", the ref count of the
        PolymorphicCallStubRoutine is decremented as expected, but since it inherits from
        GCAwareJITStubRoutine, it isn't actually deleted until GC.  In the mean time, the original
        CallLinkInfo can go away.  If PolymorphicCallNode::unlink() is called at that point,
        it will try to unlink a now deleted CallLinkInfo and crash as a result.

        The fix is to clear the CallLinkInfo references from any PolymorphicCallNode objects when
        when we set a new stub or clear an existing stub for a CallLinkInfo.  This is done by
        calling PolymorphicCallNode::clearCallNodesFor() on the old stub.

        The prior code would only call clearCallNodesFor() from the CallLinkInfo destructor.
        This only took care of the last PolymorphicCallStubRoutine held in the CallLinkInfo.
        Any prior PolymorphicCallStubRoutine would still have a, now bad, reference to the CallLinkInfo.

        In the process I refactored CallLinkInfo from a struct to a class with proper accessors and
        made all the data elements private.

        * bytecode/CallLinkInfo.cpp:
        (JSC::CallLinkInfo::clearStub): Updated to call PolymorphicCallStubRoutine::clearCallNodesFor()
        to clear the back references to this CallLinkInfo.

        Strict Equality on objects should only check that one of the two sides is an object.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145992

        This patch adds a new optimization for checking strict equality on objects.
        If we speculate that a strict equality comparison has an object on one side
        we only need to type check that side. Equality is then determined by a pointer
        comparison between the two values (although in the 32-bit case we must also check
        that the other side is a cell). Once LICM hoists type checks out of a loop we
        can be cleverer about how we choose the operand we type check if both are
        speculated to be objects.

        For testing I added the addressOf function, which returns the address
        of a Cell to the runtime.

        Besides the Array.join change, this has other optimizations based on
        profiling the Peacekeeper array benchmark.

        I measured a 14% speed improvement in the Peacekeeper array benchmark.

        Still a lot of low hanging fruit in that test because so many of functions
        on the array prototype are not optimizing for simple cases. For example,
        the reverse function does individual get and put calls even when the array

        [ES6] Destructuring assignment need to accept iterables
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144111

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch makes that destructuring assignments to array binding patterns accept iterables.
        Previously, it just access the indexed properties.
        After this patch, it iterates the given value by using ES6 iterator protocol.

        The iteration becomes different from the for-of case.
        1. Since there's no break/continue case, finally scope is not necessary.
        2. When the error is raised, the close status of the iterator becomes true. So IteratorClose is not called for that.
        3. Since the array binding patterns requires a limited count of iterations (if there is no rest(...rest) case), IteratorClose is called when the iteration does not consume the all values of the iterator.
        4. Since the array binding patterns requires a specified count of iterations, iterator's next call is skipped when iterator becomes closed.

        When generating code to put in inline caching areas, if there isn't enough space,
        then create and link to an out of line area.  We connect the inline code to this
        out of line code area by planting a jump from the inline area to the out of line
        code and appending a jump at the end of the out of line code bck to the instruction
        following the inline area.  We fill the unused inline area with nops, primarily to 
        ensure the disassembler doesn't get confused.

        There's no good way to test this in our test harness because we don't
        have a way to simulate executable memory pressure, and doing so would
        cause the cases that still use JITCompilationMustSucceed to crash.

        Instead, I tested by manually forcing all regexp JIT compilation to

        [DFG] Avoid OSR exit in the middle of string concatenation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145820

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        DFG attempt to compile ValueAdd with String type into MakeRope(left, ToString(ToPrimitive(right))).

        So when right is speculated as SpecObject, ToPrimitive(SpecObject) is speculated as SpecString.
        It leads ToString to become Identity with a speculated type check.

        However, ToPrimitive and ToString are originated from the same bytecode. And ToPrimitive may have
        an observable side effect when the given parameter is an object (calling object.{toString,valueOf}).

        So when object.toString() returns a number (it is allowed in the ES spec), ToPrimitive performs
        observable `object.toString()` calling. But ToString is converted into a speculated type check for
        SpecString and it raises OSR exit. And we exit to the original ValueAdd's bytecode position and
        it redundantly performs an observable ToPrimitive execution.

        To fix this, this patch avoid fixing up for newly introduced ToString node.
        Since fix up phase is not iterated repeatedly, by avoiding fixing up when generating the node,
        we can avoid conversion from ToString to Check.

        The main change is that objects passed in will have a type like const T& or const T*,

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.
        
        This adds a phase that does forward propagation of integer inequalities. This allows us
        to do the algebraic reasoning we need to eliminate array bounds checks in loops. It
        also eliminates overflow checks on ArithAdd with a constant.
        
        The phase's analysis produces results that are powerful enough to do speculative bounds
        check hoisting, but this phase currently only does elimination. We can implement
        hoisting later.
        
        On programs that just loop over an array like:
        
            for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i)
                thingy += array[i]
        
        This change is a 60% speed-up.
        
        This is also a ~3% speed-up on Kraken, and it shows various speed-ups on individual

        Use NakedPtr<Exception>& to return exception results.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145870

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson and Filip Pizlo.

        Before r185259, calls into the VM takes a JSValue* exception result argument for
        returning any uncaught exception that may have been thrown while executing JS code.
        As a result, clients of the VM functions will declare a local JSValue exception
        result which is automatically initialized to a null value (i.e. the empty value,
        not the JS null value).

        With r185259, the VM functions were changed to take an Exception*& exception result
        instead, and the VM functions are responsible for initializing the exception result
        to null if no exception is thrown.

        This introduces 2 issues:

        1. the VM functions are vulnerable to modifications that may add early returns
           before the exception result is nullified.  This can result in the exception
           result being used without initialization.

        2. Previously, a client could technically use the same exception result for more
           than one calls into the VM functions.  If an earlier call sets it to a thrown
           value, the thrown value will stick unless a subsequent call throws a different
           exception.

           With the new Exception*& exception result, the VM functions will always clear
           the exception result before proceeding.  As a result, the client's exception
           result will be null after the second call even though the first call saw an
           exception thrown.  This is a change in the expected behavior.

        To fix these issues, we'll introduce a NakedPtr smart pointer whose sole purpose
        is to guarantee that the pointer is initialized.  The VM functions will now take
        a NakedPtr<Exception>& instead of the Exception*&.  This ensures that the
        exception result is initialized.

        The VM functions be also reverted to only set the exception result if a new
        exception is thrown.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        ES6 iterators inherit %IteratorPrototype%.
        And these prototype objects of derived iterators don't have @@iterator methods.
        Instead they use the %IteratorPrototype%[@@iterator] method.

        To encourage inlining in for-of statement, we define this method in JS builtins.

        And these iterator prototype objects don't have any constructor function.

        WebCore::reportException() needs to be able to accept a raw thrown value in addition to Exception objects.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145872

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        In r185259, we changed exception handling code inside the VM to work with
        Exception objects instead of the thrown JSValue.  The handling code will get the
        exception stack trace from the Exception object.

        However, there is some code that cannot be updated to pass the Exception object.
        An example of this are the ObjC API functions.  Those functions are specified to
        return any thrown exception JSValue in a JSValueRef.  Since these APIs are
        public, we cannot arbitrarily change them to use the Exception object.

        There are client code that calls these APIs and then passes the returned exception
        JSValue to WebCore::reportException() to be reported.  WebCore::reportException()
        previously relied on the VM::exceptionStackTrace() to provide a cache of the
        stack trace of the last thrown exception.  VM::exceptionStackTrace() no longer
        exists in the current code.

        To restore this functionality, we will introduce VM::lastException() which
        caches the last thrown Exception object.  With this, if the exception passed to
        WebCore::reportException() to be reported isn't an Exception object (which has its
        own stack trace), reportException() can again use the cached exception stack trace
        which is available from VM::lastException().

          This is needed for making an Exception object to wrap a thrown value that does
          not have a stack trace.
          Currently, this is only used by WebCore::reportException() when there is no
          Exception object and no last exception available to provide a stack trace.

        - Added support for VM::m_lastException.
          VM::m_lastException serves to cache the exception stack of the most recently
          thrown exception like VM::exceptionStackTrace() used to before r185259.

        * runtime/VMEntryScope.cpp:
        (JSC::VMEntryScope::VMEntryScope):
        - Clear VM::m_lastException when we re-enter the VM.  Exceptions should have been
          handled before we re-enter the VM anyway.  So, this is a good place to release
          the cached last exception.

          NOTE: this is also where the old code before r185259 clears the last exception
          stack trace.  So, we're just restoring the previous behavior here in terms of
          the lifecycle of the last exception stack.

        Allow one sync GC per gcTimer interval on critical memory pressure warning
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145773

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        On critical memory pressure warning, we were calling GCController::garbageCollectSoon(),
        which does not offer any guarantee on when the garbage collection will actually take
        place.

        On critical memory pressure, we need to free up memory as soon as possible to avoid
        getting killed so this is an issue. Also, the fact that we clear the PageCache on
        critical memory pressure means a GC would likely be useful, even if the last
        collection did not free much memory.

        This patch adds a new GCController::garbageCollectNowIfNotDoneRecently() API that allows
        one synchronous GC per gcTimer interval on critical memory pressure warning. This makes
        us more responsive to critical memory pressure and avoids doing synchronous GCs too
        often.

        These functions already contained comments saying they optimize for size over speed,
        but they were using Vector::resize() which adds the usual slack for faster append().

        Switch them over to using Vector::resizeToFit() instead, which makes the Vector
        allocate a perfectly sized backing store.

        Introduce getter definition into static hash tables and use it for getters in RegExp.prototype.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145705

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        In this patch, we introduce Accessor type into property tables.
        With Accessor type, create_hash_table creates a static getter property.
        This getter property is reified as the same to the static functions.

        In the mean time, we only support getter because `putEntry` and `lookupPut`
        only work with null setter currently. However, in the spec, there's
        no need to add static setter properties. So we will add it if it becomes
        necessary in the future.

        And at the same time, this patch fixes the issue 145738. Before this patch,
        `putEntry` in `JSObject::deleteProperty` adds `undefined` property if
        `isValidOffset(...)` is false (deleted). As the result, deleting twice
        revives the property with `undefined` value.

        If the static functions are reified and the entry is
        `BuiltinOrFunctionOrAccessor`, there's no need to execute `putEntry` with
        static hash table entry. They should be handled in the normal structure's
        looking up because they should be already reified. So added guard for this.

        finally blocks should not set the exception stack trace when re-throwing the exception.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145525

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        How exceptions presently work:
        =============================
        1. op_throw can throw any JSValue.
        2. the VM tries to capture the stack at the throw point and propagate that as needed.
        3. finally blocks are implemented using op_catch to catch the thrown value, and throws it again using op_throw.

        What's wrong with how it presently works:
        ========================================
        1. finally's makes for bad exception throw line numbers in the Inspector console.

           The op_throw in finally will throw the value anew i.e. it captures a stack from the re-throw point.
           As a result, the Inspector sees the finally block as the throw point.  The original stack is lost.

        2. finally's breaks the Inspector's "Breaks on Uncaught Exception"

           This is because finally blocks are indistinguishable from catch blocks.  As a result, a try-finally,
           which should break in the Inspector on the throw, does not because the Inspector thought the
           exception was "caught".

        3. finally's yields confusing break points when the Inspector "Breaks on All Exceptions"

           a. In a try-finally scenario, the Inspector breaks 2 times: 1 at the throw, 1 at the finally.
           b. In a for-of loop (which has synthesized finallys), the Inspector will do another break.
              Similarly for other cases of JS code which synthesize finallys.
           c. At VM re-entry boundaries (e.g. js throws & returns to native code, which returns to js),
              the Inspector will do another break if there's an uncaught exception.

        How this patch fixes the issues:
        ===============================
        1. We introduce an Exception object that wraps the thrown value and the exception stack.

           When throwing an exception, the VM will check if the thrown value is an Exception
           object or not.  If it is not an Exception object, then we must be throwing a new
           exception.  The VM will create an Exception object to wrap the thrown value and
           capture the current stack for it.

           If the thrown value is already an Exception object, then the requested throw operation
           must be a re-throw.  The VM will not capture a new stack for it.

        2. op_catch will now populate 2 locals: 1 for the Exception, 1 for the thrown JSValue.

           The VM is aware of the Exception object and uses it for rethrows in finally blocks.
           JS source code is never aware of the Exception object.

           JS code is aware of the thrown value.  If it throws the caught thrown value, that
           constitutes a new throw, and a new Exception object will be created for it.

        3. The VM no longer tracks the thrown JSValue and the exception stack.  It will only
           track a m_exception field which is an Exception*.

        4. The BytecodeGenerator has already been updated in a prior patch to distinguish
           between Catch, Finally, and SynthesizedFinally blocks.  The interpreter runtime will
           now report to the debugger whether we have a Catch handler, not just any handlers.

           The debugger will use this detail to determine whether to break or not.  "Break on
           uncaught exceptions" will only break if no Catch handler was found.

           This solves the issue of the debugger breaking at finally blocks, and for-of statements.

        5. The Exception object will also have a flag to indicate whether the debugger has been
           notified of the Exception being thrown.  Once the Interpreter notifies the debugger
           of the Exception object, it will mark this flag and not repeat the notify the debugger
           again of the same Exception.

           This solves the issue of the debugger breaking at VM re-entry points due to uncaught
           exceptions.

        6. The life-cycle of the captured exception stack trace will now follow the life-cycle
           of the Exception object.

        Other changes:
        7. Change all clients of the VM::exception() to expect an Exception* instead of JSValue.

        8. Fixed a few bugs where thrown exceptions are not cleared before exiting the VM.

        9. Also renamed some variables and classes to better describe what they are.

        [JSC] Always track out-of-bounds array access explicitly instead of relying on the slow case
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145673

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Previously, we were deciding to use out-of-bounds speculation based on two informations:
        -Explicitly detected out-of-bounds accesses tracked on ArrayProfile.
        -The number of time we took the slow cases in the baseline JIT.

        The heuristic based on slow cases was a little too fragile.

        In some cases, we were running into that limit just because the indexing type changes between
        two values (typically Int32Array and DoubleArray). Sometimes we were just unlucky on what
        we used for the inline cache.

        In Kraken, this was hurting us on "audio-beat-detection" and "audio-fft". The array types we see
        change between Int32 and Double. We run into the slow path a bit but never hit
        out-of-bounds.

        By the time we compile in DFG, we have stable Double Arrays but we speculate out-of-bounds based
        on the number of slow cases we took. Because of that, we start boxing the double on GetByVal,
        using DoubleRep, etc. adding a ton of overhead over otherwise very simple operations.

        WebXPRT was also suffering from this problem but the other way arround: we were missing
        the out-of-bounds accesses due to changes in indexing types, we were below the threshold
        of slow-path access, thus we predicted in-bounds accesses for code that was doing plenty
        of out-of-bands.


        This patch fixes the problem by tracking the out-of-bounds access explicitly any time we go
        into the slow path in baseline JIT. Since we no longer miss any out-of-bounds, we can remove
        the slow-path heuristic.

        There is new additional special case in the C code regarding out-of-bounds: Arguments access.
        Mispredicting out-of-bounds accesses on arguments is a disaster for performance, so those are
        tracked in the way DFG expect it.


        There are a few important cases that are still not covered optimally:
        -PutByVal on Arguments.
        -Get/Put ByVal on TypedArray.
        Those are simply not used by DFG in any way. TypedArrays should probably be looked at in the future.

        * bytecode/ArrayProfile.cpp:
        (JSC::ArrayProfile::computeUpdatedPrediction):
        The inline-cache repatch cases now update the ArrayProfile information. This has no value in baseline

        Simplify unboxing of double JSValues known to be not NaN and not Int32
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145618

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        In many cases we know that we most likely loaded a non-NaN double value from the heap.
        Prior to this patch, we would do two branches before unboxing the double. This patch
        reduces this to one branch in the common case. Before:
        
            if (is int32)
                unbox int32 and convert to double
            else if (is number)
                unbox double
            else
                exit
        
        After:

            tmp = unbox double
            if (tmp == tmp)
                done
            else if (is int32)
                unbox int32 and convert to double
            else
                exit
        
        We only use the new style if we have profiling that tells us that we are unlikely to see
        either Int32 or NaN - since we will now exit on NaN and int32 requires an extra branch.
        
        This is a 8% speed-up on Octane/box2d. On one microbenchmark this is a 25% speed-up.
        
        Rolling this back in after I made DFG::SpeculativeJIT call a new version of unboxDouble()
        that doesn't assert that the JSValue is a double, since we are intentionally using it
        before doing the "is a double" test. This wasn't a problem on 32-bit since unboxDouble()
        does no such assertion on 32-bit.

        CallLinkStatus should return takesSlowPath if the GC often cleared the IC

        CallLinkInfo now remembers when it has been cleared by GC. This has some safeguards for when
        a call gets cleared by GC only because we hadn't converted it into a closure call; in that
        case the GC will just tell us that it should be a closure call. The DFG will not optimize
        a call that was cleared by GC, and the DFG will always prefer a closure call if the GC told
        us that the specific callee was dead but the executable wasn't.
        
        This guards us from some scenarios that came up in Speedometer. It's neutral on the pure JS
        benchmarks, most likely just because those benchmarks aren't real enough to have interesting
        GC of code.

        AtomicStringImpl::lookUp returns AtomicStringImpl*,
        it doesn't give any ownership to the caller.
        Originally, this is ok because the ownership is taken
        by AtomicStringImpl's table (& the register side).

        But if we would like to use this returned AtomicStringImpl*,
        we should take its ownership immediately.
        Because if the register side releases its ownership (ref count),
        it will be destroyed.

        In JSString::toExistingAtomicString, it returns AtomicStringImpl*.
        But it's not appropriate.
        If the owner of AtomicStringImpl* is always JSString*, it is ok.
        But it looks up the table-registered AtomicStringImpl* from
        the AtomicStringImpl table. So JSString* may not have the ownership
        of the returned AtomicStringImpl*.

        The failure situation is the following.

        1. A creates AtomicStringImpl. A has its ownership.
           And A registers it to AtomicStringImpl table.
        2. JSString looks up the AtomicStringImpl from the table.
           It gets AtomicStringImpl*. And JSString doesn't have its ownership.
           It returns the raw pointer immediately to the users
        3. A is released. There's no owner for AtomicStringImpl*.
           So it's also destroyed.
        4. Use looked up AtomicStringImpl in (2). It becomes use-after-free.

        This patch fixes it by the following changes.

        1. Change the signature of `AtomicStringImpl* AtomicStringImpl::lookUp(...)`
           to `RefPtr<AtomicStringImpl> AtomicStringImpl::lookUp(..)`.
           Use `RefPtr` because it may return `nullptr`.
        2. Change the signature of `AtomicStringImpl* JSString::toExistingAtomicString(...)`
           to `RefPtr<AtomicStringImpl> JSString::toExistingAtomicString(...)`.
           Using `RefPtr` is the same reason.
        3. Receive the result with `RefPtr<AtomicStringImpl>` in the caller side.

        TL;DR: sometimes the baseline JIT could accidentally nuke the tag before calling
               to C++, making put_by_id behave erratically.

        The bug was that put_by_id would randomly not work correctly in 32bits. It happened
        in the baseline JIT if we were unlucky enough:
        -The code get hot enough and the structure is stable so we get a fast path for
         put_by_id.
        -We repatch the fast-path branch with a stub generated by
         emitPutTransitionStubAndGetOldStructure().
        -In emitPutTransitionStubAndGetOldStructure(), we only preserve the payload of the base
         register, the tag register is ignored.
        -emitPutTransitionStubAndGetOldStructure() allocate 2 to 3 registers. Any of those
         could be the one used for the base's tag before the fast path and the value is trashed.
        -If we hit one of the failure case, we fallback to the slow path, but we destroyed
         the tag pointer.
        -We now have unrelated bits in the tag, the most likely value type is now "double"
         and we fail the put_by_id because we try to set a property on a number.

        The most obvious solution would be to change emitPutTransitionStubAndGetOldStructure()
        to preserve the tag register in addition to the value register.
        I decided against that option because of the added complexity. The DFG does not need
        that case, so I would have to add branches everywhere to distinguish the cases
        were we need to preserve the tag or not.

        Instead, I just load the tag back from memory in the slow path. The function in the slow
        path is several order of magnitude slower than a load, it is not worth eliminating it,
        especially in baseline JIT.

        I also discovered 4 useless loads in the fast path, so even with my extra load, this patch
        makes the baseline faster :)

        [JSC] Add undefined->double conversion to DoubleRep
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145293

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch adds undefined to double conversion to the DoubleRep
        node for the cases were we speculate "undefined" as part of the types
        processed.

        The use case is doing math with accidental out-of-bounds access. For example,
        something like:
            for (var i = 0; i <= length; ++i)
                ouptput += array[i];

        would cause us to OSR exit every time i === length.

        When hitting one of those cases, we would already speculate double math,
        but the DoubleRep node was unable to convert the undefined and would exit.

        With this patch the use kind NotCellUse cover this conversion for DoubleRep.
        I have been quite conservative so in general we will not find "undefined"
        until a few recompile but being optimistic seems better since this is a corner case.

        This patch is a 80% progression on WebXPRT's DNA Sequencing test.

        Remove the jsSingleCharacterSubstring() function since it's actually completely
        counter-productive: it could create a single-character string that would retain
        a much larger string for the duration of its lifetime.

        This made sense before StringImpl learned to put its characters at the tail end
        of its own allocation. Now that it does, it's far better to just create a new
        single-character StringImpl.

        With that out of the way, we can make String.prototype.charAt() use StringView

        to insert it into. DFGClobberize is converted to use LazyNode instead
        of Node* when def()'ing values, which allows to now define the array's
        length as well as the value of its various fields in NewArray and
        NewArrayBuffer nodes.

        We also introduce a Vector<uint32_t> in DFG::Graph to collect all the
        values that can be used as index, in order to avoid def()'ing too many
        values at once for big NewArrayBuffers.

        HeapLocation had to be updated to use a LazyNode as its index to be
        able to define array values.

        Object allocation sinking phase should explicitly create bottom values for CreateActivation sink candidates and CreateActivation should have SymbolTable as a child node
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145192

        When we sink CreateActivation and generate MaterializeCreateActivation

        all variables on the activation setting those variables to their default value 
        (undefined for Function activations and soon to be JS Empty Value for block scope activations). 
        This allows us to remove code that fills FTL fast activation allocations with Undefined.

        This patch also adds the constant SymbolTable as an OpInfo of CreateActivation and MaterializeCreateActivation
        nodes. This is in preparation for ES6 block scoping which will introduce a new

        Eden collections should extend the IncrementalSweeper work list, not replace it.
        <https://webkit.org/b/145213>
        <rdar://problem/21002666>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        After an eden collection, the garbage collector was adding all MarkedBlocks containing
        new objects to the IncrementalSweeper's work list, to make sure they didn't have to
        wait until the next full collection before getting swept.

        Or at least, that's what it thought it was doing. It turns out that IncrementalSweeper's
        internal work list is really just a reference to Heap::m_blockSnapshot. I didn't realize
        this when writing the post-eden sweep code, and instead made eden collections cancel
        all pending sweeps and *replace* them with the list of blocks with new objects.

        This made it so that rapidly occurring eden collections could prevent large numbers of
        heap blocks from ever getting swept. This would manifest as accumulation of MarkedBlocks
        when a system under heavy load was also allocating short lived objects at a high rate.
        Things would eventually get cleaned up when there was a lull and a full collection was
        allowed to run its heap sweep to completion.

        Fix this by moving all management of the block snapshot to Heap. snapshotMarkedSpace()
        now handles eden collections by merging the list of blocks with new objects into the
        existing block snapshot.

        Fix the build of a universal binary with ARMv7k of JavaScriptCore.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145143

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The offlineasm works in 3 phases:

        Phase 1:
           Parse the llint asm files for config options and desired offsets.
           Let's say the offlineasm discovers C unique options and O unique offsets.
           The offlineasm will then generate a LLIntDesiredOffsets.h file with
           C x C build configurations, each with a set of O offsets.

           Each of these build configurations is given a unique configuration index number.

        Phase 2: 
           Compile the LLIntDesiredOffsets.h file into a JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor binary.

           If we're building a fat binary with 2 configurations: armv7, and armv7k,
           then the fat binary will contain 2 blobs of offsets, one for each of these
           build configurations.

        Phase 3:
           Parse the llint asm files and emit asm code using the offsets that are
           extracted from the JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor binary for the corresponding
           configuration index number.

        In the pre-existing code, there are no "if ARMv7k" statements in the llint asm
        source.  As a result, OFFLINE_ASM_ARMv7k is not one of the config options in
        the set of C unique options.

        For armv7k builds, OFFLINE_ASM_ARMv7 is also true.  As a result, for an armv7k
        target, we will end up building armv7 source.  In general, this is fine except:

        1. armv7k has different alignment requirements from armv7.  Hence, their offset
           values (in JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor) will be different.

        2. The offlineasm was never told that it needed to make a different configuration
           for armv7k builds.  Hence, the armv7k build of LLIntDesiredOffsets.h will
           build the armv7 configuration, and consequently, the armv7k blob of offsets in
           JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor will have the same configuration index number as
           the armv7 blob of offsets.

        In phase 3, when the offlineasm parses the JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor fat binary
        looking for the armv7 build's configuration index number, it discovers the
        armv7k blob which has the same configuration number.  As a result, it
        erroneously thinks the armv7k offsets are appropriate for emitting armv7 code.
        Needless to say, armv7 code using armv7k offsets will lead to incorrect behavior
        and all round badness.

        The fix is to add a simple "if ARMv7k" statement to the llint asm files.  While
        the if statement has no body, it does make the offlineasm aware of the need for
        ARMv7k as a configuration option.  As a result, it will generate an armv7k
        variant configuration in the LLIntDesiredOffsets.h file with its own unique
        configuration index number.  With that, the JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor fat binary
        will no longer have duplicate configuration index numbers for the armv7 and
        armv7k blobs of offsets, and the issue is resolved.

        When JSString is a substring internally, calling value(ExecState*) on it

        Add SpecBoolInt32 type that means "I'm an int and I'm either 0 or 1"

        It's super useful to know if an integer value could be either zero or one. We have an
        immediate need for this because of Int32|Boolean uses, where knowing that the Int32 is
        either 0 or 1 means that there is no actual polymorphism if you just look at the low bit
        (1 behaves like true, 0 behaves like false, and the low bit of 1|true is 1, and the low
        bit of 0|false is 0).
        
        We do this by splitting the SpecInt32 type into SpecBoolInt32 and SpecNonBoolInt32. This
        change doesn't have any effect on behavior, yet. But it does give us the ability to
        predict and prove when values are SpecBoolInt32; it's just we don't leverage this yet.
        
        This is perf-neutral.

        [JSC] When entering a CheckTierUp without OSREntry, force the CheckTierUp for the outer loops with OSR Entry
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145092

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        When we have a hot loop without OSR Entry inside a slower loop that support OSR Entry,
        we get the inside loop driving the tierUpCounter and we have very little chance of
        doing a CheckTierUp on the outer loop. In turn, this give almost no opportunity to tier
        up in the outer loop and OSR Enter there.

        This patches changes CheckTierUp to force its outer loops to do a CheckTierUp themselves.

        To do that, CheckTierUp sets a flag "nestedTriggerIsSet" to force the outer loop to
        enter their CheckTierUp regardless of the tier-up counter.

        * bytecode/ExecutionCounter.cpp:
        (JSC::ExecutionCounter<countingVariant>::setThreshold):
        This is somewhat unrelated. This assertion is incorrect because it relies on
        m_counter, which changes on an other thread.

        I have hit it a couple of times with this patch because we are a bit more aggressive
        on CheckTierUp. What happens is:
        1) ExecutionCounter<countingVariant>::checkIfThresholdCrossedAndSet() first checks
           hasCrossedThreshold(), and it is false.
        2) On the main thread, the hot loops keeps running and the counter becomes large
           enough to cross the threshold.
        3) ExecutionCounter<countingVariant>::checkIfThresholdCrossedAndSet() runs the next
           test, setThreshold(), where the assertion is. Since the counter is now large enough,
           the assertion fails.

        Insert store barriers late so that IR transformations don't have to worry about them

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        We have had three kinds of bugs with store barriers. For the sake of discussion we say
        that a store barrier is needed when we have something like:
        
            base.field = value
        
        - We sometimes fail to realize that we could remove a barrier when value is a non-cell.
          This might happen if we prove value to be a non-cell even though in the FixupPhase it
          wasn't predicted non-cell.
        
        - We sometimes have a barrier in the wrong place after object allocation sinking. We
          might sink an allocation to just above the store, but that puts it just after the
          StoreBarrier that FixupPhase inserted.
        
        - We don't remove redundant barriers across basic blocks.
        
        This comprehensively fixes these issues by doing store barrier insertion late, and
        removing the store barrier elision phase. Store barrier insertion uses an epoch-based
        algorithm to determine when stores need barriers. Briefly, a barrier is not needed if
        base is in the current GC epoch (i.e. was the last object that we allocated or had a
        barrier since last GC) or if base has a newer GC epoch than value (i.e. value would have
        always been allocated before base). We do conservative things when merging epoch state
        between basic blocks, and we only do such inter-block removal in the FTL. FTL also
        queries AI to determine what type we've proved about value, and avoids barriers when
        value is not a cell. FixupPhase still inserts type checks on some stores, to maximize
        the likelihood that this AI-based removal is effective.

        We have had three kinds of bugs with store barriers. For the sake of discussion we say
        that a store barrier is needed when we have something like:
        
            base.field = value
        
        - We sometimes fail to realize that we could remove a barrier when value is a non-cell.
          This might happen if we prove value to be a non-cell even though in the FixupPhase it
          wasn't predicted non-cell.
        
        - We sometimes have a barrier in the wrong place after object allocation sinking. We
          might sink an allocation to just above the store, but that puts it just after the
          StoreBarrier that FixupPhase inserted.
        
        - We don't remove redundant barriers across basic blocks.
        
        This comprehensively fixes these issues by doing store barrier insertion late, and
        removing the store barrier elision phase. Store barrier insertion uses an epoch-based
        algorithm to determine when stores need barriers. Briefly, a barrier is not needed if
        base is in the current GC epoch (i.e. was the last object that we allocated or had a
        barrier since last GC) or if base has a newer GC epoch than value (i.e. value would have
        always been allocated before base). We do conservative things when merging epoch state
        between basic blocks, and we only do such inter-block removal in the FTL. FTL also
        queries AI to determine what type we've proved about value, and avoids barriers when
        value is not a cell. FixupPhase still inserts type checks on some stores, to maximize
        the likelihood that this AI-based removal is effective.

        DFGLICMPhase shouldn't create NodeOrigins with forExit but without semantic
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145062

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        We assert in various places (including NodeOrigin::isSet()) that a
        NodeOrigin's semantic and forExit must be either both set, or both
        unset.  However, LICM'ing a node with unset NodeOrigin would only set
        forExit, and leave semantic unset. This can for instance happen when a
        Phi node is constant-folded into a JSConstant, which in turn gets
        LICM'd.

        This patch changes DFGLICMPhase to set the NodeOrigin's semantic in
        addition to its forExit if semantic was previously unset.

        It also adds two validators to DFGValidate.cpp:
         - In both SSA and CPS form, a NodeOrigin semantic and forExit must be either both set or both unset
         - In CPS form, all nodes must have a set NodeOrigin forExit (this is
           the CPS counterpart to the SSA validator that checks that all nodes
           must have a set NodeOrigin except possibly for a continuous chunk of

        [ES6] Implement tagged templates
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143183

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        This patch implements ES6 tagged templates.
        In tagged templates, the function takes the template object.

        The template object contains the raw and cooked template strings,
        so when parsing the tagged templates, we need to tokenize the raw and cooked strings.
        While tagged templates require the both strings, the template literal only requires
        the cooked strings. So when tokenizing under the template literal context,
        we only builds the cooked strings.

        As per ES6 spec, the template objects for the same raw strings are shared in the same realm.
        The template objects is cached. And every time we evaluate the same tagged templates,
        the same (cached) template objects are used.
        Since the spec freezes this template objects completely,
        we cannot attach some properties to it.
        So we can say that it behaves as if the template objects are the primitive values (like JSString).
        Since we cannot attach properties, the only way to test the identity of the template object is comparing. (===)
        As the result, when there is no reference to the template object, we can garbage collect it
        because the user has no way to test that the newly created template object does not equal
        to the already collected template object.

        So, to implement tagged templates, we implement the following components.

        1. JSTemplateRegistryKey
        It holds the template registry key and it does not exposed to users.
        TemplateRegistryKey holds the vector of raw and cooked strings with the pre-computed hash value.
        When obtaining the template object for the (statically, a.k.a. at the parsing time) given raw string vectors,
        we use this JSTemplateRegistryKey as a key to the map and look up the template object from
        TemplateRegistry.
        JSTemplateRegistryKey is created at the bytecode compiling time and
        stored in the CodeBlock as like as JSString content values.

        2. TemplateRegistry
        This manages the cached template objects.
        It holds the weak map (JSTemplateRegistryKey -> the template object).
        The template object is weakly referenced.
        So if there is no reference to the template object,
        the template object is automatically GC-ed.
        When looking up the template object, it searches the cached template object.
        If it is found, it is returned to the users.
        If there is no cached template objects, it creates the new template object and
        stores it with the given template registry key.

        REGRESSION(r180595): same-callee profiling no longer works
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144787

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch introduces a DFG optimization to use NewObject node when the callee of op_create_this is
        always the same JSFunction. This condition doesn't hold when the byte code creates multiple
        JSFunction objects at runtime as in: function y() { return function () {} }; new y(); new y();

        To enable this optimization, LLint and baseline JIT now store the last callee we saw in the newly
        added fourth operand of op_create_this. We use this JSFunction's structure in DFG after verifying
        our speculation that the callee is the same. To avoid recompiling the same code for different callee
        objects in the polymorphic case, the special value of seenMultipleCalleeObjects() is set in
        LLint and baseline JIT when multiple callees are observed.

        ES6: Allow duplicate property names

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Introduce new `op_put_getter_by_id` and `op_put_setter_by_id` opcodes
        that will define a single getter or setter property on an object.

        The existing `op_put_getter_setter` opcode is still preferred for
        putting both a getter and setter at the same time but cannot be used
        for putting an individual getter or setter which is needed in
        some cases.

        Add a new slow path when generating bytecodes for a property list

        First I made fixTypeForRepresentation() print out better diagnostics when it dies.
        
        Then I fixed the bug: Node::convertToIdentityOn(Node*) needs to make sure that when it
        converts to a representation-changing node, it needs to use one of the UseKinds that such
        a node expects. For example, DoubleRep(UntypedUse:) doesn't make sense; it needs to be
        something like DoubleRep(NumberUse:) since it will speculate that the input is a number.

        The liveness pruning done by ObjectAllocationSinkingPhase ignores the possibility of an object's bytecode liveness being longer than its DFG liveness
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144945

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        We were making the mistake of using DFG liveness for object allocation sinking decisions.
        This is wrong. In fact we almost never want to use DFG liveness directly. The only place
        where that makes sense is pruning in DFG AI.
        
        So, I created a CombinedLiveness class that combines the DFG liveness with bytecode
        liveness.
        
        In the process of doing this, I realized that the DFGForAllKills definition of combined
        liveness at block tail was not strictly right; it was using the bytecode liveness at the
        block terminal instead of the union of the bytecode live-at-heads of successor blocks. So,
        I changed DFGForAllKills to work in terms of CombinedLiveness.
        
        This allows me to unskip the test I added in r184260. I also added a new test that tries to
        trigger this bug more directly.

        REGRESSION(r184260): arguments elimination has stopped working because of Check(UntypedUse:) from SSAConversionPhase
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144951

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        There were two issues here:
        
        - In r184260 we expected a small number of possible use kinds in Check nodes, and
          UntypedUse was not one of them. That seemed like a sensible assumption because we don't
          create Check nodes unless it's to have a check. But, SSAConversionPhase was creating a
          Check that could have UntypedUse. I fixed this. It's cleaner for SSAConversionPhase to
          follow the same idiom as everyone else and not create tautological checks.
        
        - It's clearly not very robust to assume that Checks will not be used tautologically. So,
          this changes how we validate Checks in the escape analyses. We now use willHaveCheck,
          which catches cases that AI would have already marked as unnecessary. It then also uses
          a new helper called alreadyChecked(), which allows us to just ask if the check is
          unnecessary for objects. That's a good fall-back in case AI hadn't run yet.

        js/dom/stack-trace.html fails with eager compilation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144853

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.
        
        All of our escape analyses were mishandling Check(). They were assuming that this is a
        non-escaping operation. But, if we do for example a Check(Int32:@x) and @x is an escape
        candidate, then we need to do something: if we eliminate or sink @x, then the check no
        longer makes any sense since a phantom allocation has no type. This will make us forget
        that this operation would have exited. This was causing us to not call a valueOf method in
        js/dom/stack-trace.html with eager compilation enabled, because it was doing something like
        +o where o had a valueOf method, and o was otherwise sinkable.
        
        This changes our escape analyses to basically pretend that any Check() that isn't obviously
        unnecessary is an escape. We don't have to be super careful here. Most checks will be
        completely eliminated by constant-folding. If that doesn't run in time, then the most
        common check we will see is CellUse. So, we just recognize some very obvious check kinds
        that we know would have passed, and for all of the rest we just assume that it's an escape.
        
        This was super tricky to test. The obvious way to test it is to use +o like
        stack-trace.html, except that doing so relies on the fact that we still haven't implemented
        the optimal behavior for op_to_number. So, I take four approaches in testing this patch:
        
        1) Use +o. These will test what we want it to test for now, but at some point in the future
           these tests will just be a good sanity-check that our op_to_number implementation is
           right.
        
        2) Do fancy control flow tricks to fool the profiling into thinking that some arithmetic
           operation always sees integers even though we eventually feed it an object and that
           object is a sink candidate.
        
        3) Introduce a new jsc.cpp intrinsic called isInt32() which returns true if the incoming
           value is an int32. This intrinsic is required to be implemented by DFG by
           unconditionally speculating that the input is int32. This allows us to write much more
           targetted tests of the underlying issue.
        
        4) I made a version of stack-trace.html that runs in run-jsc-stress-tests, so that we can
           get regression test coverage of this test in eager mode.

        Windows: Cannot use HANDLE from GetCurrentThread() to get the CONTEXT of another thread.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144924

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        The present stack scanning code in the Windows port is expecting that the
        GetCurrentThread() API will provide a unique HANDLE for each thread.  The code
        then saves and later uses that HANDLE with GetThreadContext() to get the
        runtime state of the target thread from the GC thread.  According to
        https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683182(v=vs.85).aspx,
        GetCurrentThread() does not provide this unique HANDLE that we expect:

            "The function cannot be used by one thread to create a handle that can
            be used by other threads to refer to the first thread. The handle is
            always interpreted as referring to the thread that is using it. A
            thread can create a "real" handle to itself that can be used by other
            threads, or inherited by other processes, by specifying the pseudo
            handle as the source handle in a call to the DuplicateHandle function."

        As a result of this, GetCurrentThread() always returns the same HANDLE value, and
        we end up never scanning the stacks of other threads because we wrongly think that
        they are all equal (in identity) to the scanning thread.  This, in turn, results
        in crashes due to objects that are incorrectly collected.

        The fix is to call DuplicateHandle() to create a HANDLE that we can use.  The
        MachineThreads::Thread class already accurately tracks the period of time when
        we need that HANDLE for the VM.  Hence, the life-cycle of the HANDLE can be tied
        to the life-cycle of the MachineThreads::Thread object for the corresponding thread.

        [JSC] Make the NegZero backward propagated flags of ArithMod stricter
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144897

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The NegZero flags of ArithMod were the same as ArithDiv: both children were
        marked as needing to handle NegativeZero.

        Lucky for us, ArithMod is quite a bit different than ArithDiv.

        First, the sign of the result is completely independent from
        the sign of the divisor. A zero on the divisor always produces a NaN.
        That's great, we can remove the NodeBytecodeNeedsNegZero
        from the flags propagated to child2.

        Second, the sign of the result is always the same as the sign of
        the dividend. A dividend of zero produces a zero of same sign
        unless the divisor is zero (in which case the result is NaN).
        This is great too: we can just pass the flags we got into
        ArithMod.

        With those two out of the way, we can make a faster version of ArithRound
        for Kraken's oscillator. Since we no longer care about negative zero,
        rounding becomes cast<int32>(value + 0.5). This gives ~3% faster runtime
        on the benchmark.

        Unfortunatelly, most of the time is spent in FTL and the same optimization
        does not apply well just yet: rdar://problem/20904149.

        OSR availability analysis would be more scalable (and correct) if it did more liveness pruning

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        In https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144883, we found an example of where liveness
        pruning is actually necessary. Well, not quite: we just need to prune out keys from the
        heap availability map where the base node doesn't dominate the point where we are asking
        for availability. If we don't do this, then eventually the IR gets corrupt because we'll
        insert PutHints that reference the base node in places where the base node doesn't
        dominate. But if we're going to do any pruning, then it makes sense to prune by bytecode
        liveness. This is the strongest possible pruning we can do, and it should be sound. We
        shouldn't have a node available for a virtual register if that register is live and the
        node doesn't dominate.
        
        Making this work meant reusing the prune-to-liveness algorithm from the FTL backend. So, I
        abstracted this a bit better. You can now availabilityMap.pruneByLiveness(graph, origin).

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        This patch introduces a DFG optimization to use NewObject node when the callee of op_create_this is
        always the same JSFunction. This condition doesn't hold when the byte code creates multiple
        JSFunction objects at runtime as in: function y() { return function () {} }; new y(); new y();

        To enable this optimization, LLint and baseline JIT now store the last callee we saw in the newly
        added fourth operand of op_create_this. We use this JSFunction's structure in DFG after verifying
        our speculation that the callee is the same. To avoid recompiling the same code for different callee
        objects in the polymorphic case, the special value of seenMultipleCalleeObjects() is set in
        LLint and baseline JIT when multiple callees are observed.

        We shouldn't promote LoadVarargs to a sequence of GetStacks and PutStacks if doing so would exceed the LoadVarargs' limit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144851

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        LoadVarargs loads arguments from some object and puts them on the stack. The region of
        stack is controlled by a bunch of meta-data, including InlineCallFrame. InlineCallFrame
        shouldn't really be edited after ByteCodeParser, so we cannot convert LoadVarargs to
        something that uses more stack than the LoadVarargs wanted to.
        
        This check was missing in the ArgumentsEliminationPhase's LoadVarargs->GetStack+PutStack
        promoter. This is an important promotion rule for performance, and in cases where we are
        compiling truly hot code, the LoadVarargs limit will be at least as big as the length of
        the phantom arguments array that this phase sees. The LoadVarargs limit is based on
        profiling and the phantom arguments array is a proof; in most cases the profiling is more
        conservative.
        
        But, you could write some crazy code where the statically obvious arguments array value is
        bigger than what the profiling would have told you. When this happens, this promotion
        effectively removes a bounds check. This either results in us clobbering a bunch of stack,
        or it means that we never initialize a region of the stack that a later operation will read
        (the uninitialization happens because PutStackSinkingPhase removes PutStacks that appear
        unnecessary, and a GetMyArgumentByVal will claim not to use the region of the stack outside
        the original LoadVarargs limit).

        Previously if you loaded from a hole, you'd either have to take slow path for the array
        load (which means C++ calls and prototype chain walks) or you'd exit (if you hadn't
        gathered the necessary profiling yet). But that's unnecessary if we know that the
        prototype chain is sane - i.e. has no indexed properties. Then we can just return
        Undefined for the hole.
        
        Making this change requires setting more watchpoints on the array prototype chain. But
        that hit a horrible bug: ArrayPrototype still uses the static lookup tables and builds
        itself up lazily. This means that this increased the number of recompilations we'd get
        due to the array prototype chain being built up.
        
        So, this change also removes the laziness and static tables from ArrayPrototype.
        
        But to make that change, I also had to add a helper for eagerly building up a prototype
        that has builtin functions.

        GC has trouble with pathologically large array allocations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144609

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The bug was that SlotVisitor::copyLater() would return early for oversize blocks (right
        after pinning them), and would skip the accounting. The GC calculates the size of the heap
        in tandem with the scan to save time, and that accounting was part of how the GC would
        know how big the heap was. The GC would then think that oversize copied blocks use no
        memory, and would then mess up its scheduling of the next GC.
        
        Fixing this bug is harder than it seems. When running an eden GC, we figure out the heap
        size by summing the size from the last collection and the size by walking the eden heap.
        But this breaks when we eagerly delete objects that the last collection touched. We can do
        that in one corner case: copied block reallocation. The old block will be deleted from old
        space during the realloc and a new block will be allocated in new space. In order for the
        GC to know that the size of old space actually shrank, we need a field to tell us how much
        such shrinkage could occur. Since this is a very dirty corner case and it only works for
        very particular reasons arising from the special properties of copied space (single owner,
        and the realloc is used in places where the compiler already knows that it cannot register
        allocate a pointer to the old block), I opted for an equally dirty shrinkage counter
        devoted just to this case. It's called bytesRemovedFromOldSpaceDueToReallocation.
        
        To test this, I needed to add an Option to force a particular RAM size in the GC. This
        allows us to write tests that assert that the GC heap size is some value X, without
        worrying about machine-to-machine variations due to GC heuristics changing based on RAM
        size.

        This patch adds two optimizations targeting Math.round():

        -Change the MacroAssembler to be stricter on how we fail to convert a double
         to ingeter. Previously, any number valued zero would fail, now we only
         fail for -0.

        Since ArithRound speculate it produces int32, the MacroAssembler assembler
        part became necessary because zero is a pretty common output of Math.round()
        and we would OSR exit a lot (and eventually recompile for doubles).

        The implementation itself of the inline Math.round() is exactly the same
        as the C function that exists for Math.round(). We can very likely do better
        but it is a good start known to be valid and inlining alone alread provides

        FunctionCallBracketNode should store the base value to the temporary when subscript has assignment
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144678

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Currently, FunctionCallBracketNode directly use the RegisterID returned by emitNode.
        But if the base part is the local register and the subscript part has assignment to it, the base result is accidentally rewritten.

        function t() { var ok = {null: function () { } }; ok[ok = null](); }
        t();  // Should not throw error.

        This patch takes care about `subscriptHasAssignment`.
        By using `emitNodeForLeftHandSide`, when there's assignment to local variables in RHS,
        it correctly moves the LHS value to a temporary register.

        This patch makes the initialization of global functions more explicit by
        moving initialization into bytecode. It also prepares JSC for having ES6
        style lexical scoping because initializing global functions in bytecode
        easily allows global functions to be initialized with the proper scope that
        will have access to global lexical variables. Global lexical variables
        should be visible to global functions but don't live on the global object.

        Optimize WeakBlock's "reap" and "visit" operations.
        <https://webkit.org/b/144585>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        WeakBlock was using Heap::isLive(void*) to determine the liveness of weak pointees.
        That function was really written with conservative roots marking in mind, and will do a bunch
        of sanity and bounds checks.

        For weaks, we know that the pointer will have been a valid cell pointer into a block
        of appropriate cell size, so we can skip a lot of the checks.

        We now keep a pointer to the MarkedBlock in each WeakBlock. That way we no longer have to do
        MarkedBlock::blockFor() for every single cell when iterating.

        Note that a WeakBlock's MarkedBlock pointer becomes null when we detach a logically empty
        WeakBlock from its WeakSet and transfer ownership to Heap. At that point, the block will never
        be pointing to any live cells, and the only operation that will run on the block is sweep().

        Finally, MarkedBlock allows liveness queries in three states: Marked, Retired, and Allocated.
        In Allocated state, all cells are reported as live. This state will reset to Marked on next GC.
        This patch uses that knowledge to avoid branching on the MarkedBlock's state for every cell.

        This is a ~3x speedup of visit() and a ~2x speedup of reap() on Dromaeo/dom-modify, netting
        what looks like a 1% speedup locally.

        Allocation sinking is prohibiting the creation of phis between a Phantom object and its materialization
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144587

        Rubber stamped by Filip Pizlo.

        When sinking object allocations, we ensure in
        determineMaterializationPoints that whenever an allocation is
        materialized on a path to a block, it is materialized in all such
        paths. Thus when running the SSA calculator to place Phis in
        placeMaterializationPoints, we can't encounter a situation where some
        Upsilons are referring to a materialization while others are referring
        to the phantom object.

        This replaces the code that was adding a materialization late in
        placeMaterializationPoints to handle that case by an assertion that it
        does not happen, which will make
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143073 easier to implement.

        REGRESSION(r183570): jslib-traverse-jquery is 22% slower
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144476

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        jslib-traverse-jquery is now 31% faster than its unregressed baseline.

        The jQuery algorithm for sorting DOM nodes is so pathologically slow that,
        to my knowledge, the topic of how to optimize it is not covered in any
        literature about sorting.

        On the slowest jQuery sorting test -- prevAll -- our new
        Array.prototype.sort, compared to its predecessor, performed 12% fewer
        comparisons and requireed 10X less overhead per comparison. Yet, it was
        slower.

        It was slower because it inadvertantly increased the average cost of the
        comparison function by 2X. jQuery uses compareDocumentPosition to compare
        DOM nodes, and compareDocumentPosition(a, b) is O(N) in the distance
        required to traverse backwards from b to a. In prevAll, we encounter the
        worst case for merge sort of compareDocumentPosition: A long list of DOM
        nodes in mostly reverse order. In this case, merge sort will sequentially
        compareDocumentPosition(a, b), where a is not reachable backwards from
        b, and therefore compareDocumentPosition will traverse the whole sibling
        list.

        The solution is simple enough: Call compareDocumentPosition(b, a) instead.

        This is a pretty silly thing to do, but it is harmless, and jQuery is
        popular, so let's do it.

        We do not risk suffering the same problem in reverse when sorting a long
        list of DOM nodes in forward order. (We still have a 37% speedup on the
        nextAll benchmark.) The reason is that merge sort performs 2X fewer
        comparisons when the list is already sorted, so we can worry less about
        the cost of each comparison.

        A fully principled soultion to this problem would probably do something
        like Python's timsort, which special-cases ordered ranges to perform
        only O(n) comparisons. But that would contradict our original
        goal of just having something simple that works.

        Another option is for elements to keep a compareDocumentPosition cache,
        like a node list cache, which allows you to determine the absolute
        position of a node using a hash lookup. I will leave this as an exercise
        for kling.

        (sort.merge): Compare in an order that is favorable to a comparator

        TypeOf should be fast

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        Adds comprehensive support for fast typeof to the optimizing JITs. Calls into the runtime
        are only used for very exotic objects - they must have either the MasqueradesAsUndefined or
        TypeOfShouldCallGetCallData type flags set. All other cases are handled inline.
        
        This means optimizing IsObjectOrNull, IsFunction, and TypeOf - all node types that used to
        rely heavily on C++ calls to fulfill their function.
        
        Because TypeOf is now so fast, we no longer need to do any speculations on this node.
        
        In the FTL, we take this further by querying AI for each branch in the TypeOf decision tree.
        This means that if the TypeOf is dominated by any type checks, we will automatically prune
        out cases that are redundant.
        
        This patch anticipates the addition of SwitchTypeOf or something like that. So, the TypeOf
        code generation is designed to be reusable.
        
        This is a speed-up on most typeof benchmarks. But, it is a slow-down on benchmarks that take
        the exotic call trap hook. That hook is now in a deeper slow path than before.

        This makes our type check folding even more comprehensive by ensuring that even if the FTL
        decides to emit some checks, it will still do another query to the abstract interpreter to
        see if the check is necessary. This helps with cases where we decided early on to speculate
        one way, but later proved a more specific type of the value in question, and the constant
        folder didn't catch it.
        
        This also makes it more natural to query the abstract interpreter. For example, if you just
        want the proven type, you can now say provenType(node) or provenType(edge).

        Function allocation sinking shouldn't be performed on singleton functions

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Function allocations usually are free of any other side effects, but
        this is not the case for allocations performed while the underlying
        FunctionExecutable is still a singleton (as this allogation will fire
        watchpoints invalidating code that depends on it being a singleton).
        As the object allocation sinking phase assumes object allocation is
        free of side-effects, sinking these allocations is not correct.

        This also means that when materializing a function allocation on OSR
        exit, that function's executable will never be a singleton, and we don't have
        to worry about its watchpoint, allowing us to use
        JSFunction::createWithInvalidatedRellocationWatchpoint instead of
        JSFunction::create.

        Move all of the branchIs<type> helpers from SpeculativeJIT into AssemblyHelpers

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen and Mark Lam.
        
        At some point we started adding representation-agnostic helpers for doing common type tests.
        We added some in SpeculativeJIT, and then some in AssemblyHelpers. Prior to this change,
        they had overlapping powers, though SpeculativeJIT was a bit better.
        
        This removes SpeculativeJIT's helpers and strengthens AssemblyHelpers' helpers. This is
        better because now all of these helpers can be used in all of the assembly-based JITs, not
        just the DFG. It also settles on what I find to be a slightly better naming convention.
        For example where we previously would have said branchIsString, now we say
        branchIfString. Similarly, branchNotString becomes branchIfNotString.

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.
        
        Fixup phase was super cleverly folding an IsString(@x) when @x is predicted SpecString
        into a Check(String:@x) followed by JSConstant(true). Then in these tests the
        ValueAdd(IsString(@x), @stuff) would try to turn this into an integer add by cleverly
        converting the boolean into an integer. But as part of doing that, it would try to
        short-circuit any profiling by leveraging the fact that the IsString is now a constant,
        and it would try to figure out if the addition might overflow. Part of that logic
        involved checking if the immediate is either a boolean or a sufficiently small integer.
        But: it would check if it's a sufficiently small integer before checking if it was a
        boolean, so it would try to call asNumber() on the boolean.
        
        All of this cleverness was very deliberate, but apparently the @stuff + booleanConstant
        case was previously never hit until I wrote these tests, and so we never knew that
        calling asNumber() on a boolean was wrong.
        
        The fix is super simple: the expression should just check for boolean first.
        
        This bug was benign in release builds. JSValue::asNumber() on a boolean would return
        garbage, and that's OK, since we'd take the boolean case anyway.

        Use the default hash value for Symbolized StringImpl
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144347

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Before this patch, symbolized StringImpl* has a special hash value
        to avoid the hash collision with the other normal StringImpl*.
        I guess that it is introduced when private symbols are introduced.
        However, it prevents using symbolized StringImpl* in the other place
        For example, using it as WTFString cause a problem because of its special hash value.

        When only using private symbols, they are not exposed to the outside of JSC,
        so we can handle it carefully. But now, it's extended to symbols.
        So I think storing a special hash value in StringImpl* causes an error.

        To avoid this, I propose using the usual hash value in symbolized StringImpl*.
        And to provide significantly different hash value when using it as symbol,
        store the additional hash value in symbolized StringImpl*. It is used when
        the hash value is required by IdentifierRepHash.

        [JSC] Remove RageConvert array conversion
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144433

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        RageConvert was causing a subtle bug that was hitting the Kraken crypto tests
        pretty hard:
        -The indexing types shows that the array access varies between Int32 and DoubleArray.
        -ArrayMode::fromObserved() decided to use the most generic type: DoubleArray.
         An Arrayify node would convert the Int32 to that type.
        -Somewhere, a GetByVal or PutByVal would have the flag NodeBytecodeUsesAsInt. That
         node would use RageConvert instead of Convert.
        -The Arrayify for that GetByVal with RageConvert would not convert the array to
         Contiguous.
        -All the following array access that do not have the flag NodeBytecodeUsesAsInt would
         now expect a DoubleArray and always get a Contiguous Array. The CheckStructure
         fail systematically and we never get to run the later code.

        Getting rid of RageConvert fixes the problem and does not seems to have any
        negative side effect on other benchmarks.

        The improvments on Kraken are:
            -stanford-crypto-aes: definitely 1.0915x faster.
            -stanford-crypto-pbkdf2: definitely 1.2446x faster.

        This patch implements Array.prototype.sort in JavaScript, removing the
        C++ implementations. It is simpler and less error-prone to express our
        operations in JavaScript, which provides memory safety, exception safety,
        and recursion safety.

        The performance result is mixed, but net positive in my opinion. It's
        difficult to enumerate all the results, since we used to have so many
        different sorting modes, and there are lots of different data patterns
        across which you might want to measure sorting. Suffice it to say:

            (*) The benchmarks we track are faster or unchanged.

            (*) Sorting random input using a comparator -- which we think is
            common -- is 3X faster.

            (*) Sorting random input in a non-array object -- which jQuery does
            -- is 4X faster.

            (*) Sorting random input in a compact array of integers using a
            trivial pattern-matchable comparator is 2X *slower*.

        (sort.stringComparator):

        we don't want to hang when sorting new Array(BIG).

        (sort.compact):
        (sort.merge):
        (sort.mergeSort): Use merge sort because it's a reasonably efficient
        stable sort. We have evidence that some sites depend on stable sort,
        even though the ES6 spec does not mandate it. (See
        <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/33967>.)

        This is a textbook implementation of merge sort with three optimizations:

            (1) Use iteration instead of recursion;

            (2) Use array subscripting instead of array copying in order to
            create logical sub-lists without creating physical sub-lists;

            (3) Swap src and dst at each iteration instead of copying src into
            dst, and only copy src into the subject array at the end if src is
            not the subject array.

        The bug is that the object allocation sinking phase did not account for a case
        where a property of a sunken object is only initialized on one path and not
        another.  As a result, on the path where the property is not initialized, we'll
        encounter an Upsilon with a BottomValue (which is not allowed by definition).

        The fix is to use a JSConstant(undefined) as the bottom value instead (of
        BottomValue).  If the property is uninitialized, it should still be accessible
        and have the value undefined.

        REGRESSION (r183373): ASSERT failed in wtf/SHA1.h
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144257

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        SHA1 is used to calculate CodeBlockHash.
        To calculate hash value, we pass the source code UTF-8 CString to SHA1::addBytes.
        However, the source code can contain null character.
        So when performing `strlen` on the source code's CString, it returns the incorrect length.
        In SHA1::addBytes, there's assertion `input.length() == strlen(string)` and it fails.

        In the template-literal-syntax.js, we perform `eval` with the script contains "\0".
        As the result, `strlen(string)` accidentally shortened by the contained "\0", and assertion fails.

        CString will be changed not to contain a null-character[1]. However, inserting the assertion here
        is not correct. Because

        1. If CString should not contain a null character, this should be asserted in CString side instead of SHA1::addBytes.
        2. If CString can contain a null character, this assertion becomes incorrect.

        So this patch just drops the assertion.

        In the current implementation, we once convert the entire source code to the newly allocated
        UTF-8 string and pass it to the SHA1 processing. However, this is memory consuming.
        Ideally, we should stream the decoded bytes into the SHA1 processing iteratively.
        We'll implement it in the separate patch[2].

        DFG should not use or preserve Phantoms during transformations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143736

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        Since http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/183207 and http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/183406, it is
        no longer necessary to preserve Phantoms during transformations. They are still useful just
        before FixupPhase to support backwards propagation analyses. They are still inserted late in the
        game in the DFG backend. But transformations don't need to worry about them. Inside a basic
        block, we can be sure that so long as the IR pinpoints the place where the value becomes
        available in a bytecode register (using MovHint) and so long as there is a SetLocal anytime some
        other block would need the value (either for OSR or for DFG execution), then we don't need any
        liveness markers.
        
        So, this removes any places where we inserted Phantoms just for liveness during transformation
        and it replaces convertToPhantom() with remove(), which just converts the node to a Check. A
        Check node only keeps its children so long as those children have checks.
        
        The fact that we no longer convertToPhantom() means that we have to be more careful when
        constant-folding GetLocal. Previously we would convertToPhantom() and use the fact that
        Phantom(Phi) was a valid construct. It's not valid anymore. So, when constant folding encounters
        a GetLocal it needs to insert a PhantomLocal directly. This allows us to simplify
        Graph::convertToConstant() a bit. Luckily, none of the other users of this method would see
        GetLocals.
        
        The only Phantom-like cruft left over after this patch is:
        
        - Phantoms before FixupPhase. I kind of like these. It means that before FixupPhase, we can do
          backwards analyses and rely on the fact that the users of a node in DFG IR are a superset of
          the users of the original local's live range in bytecode. This is essential for supporting our
          BackwardsPropagationPhase, which is an important optimization for things like asm.js.
        
        - PhantomLocals and GetLocals being NodeMustGenerate. See discussion in
          https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144086. It appears that this is not as evil as the
          alternatives. The best long-term plan is to simply ditch the ThreadedCPS IR entirely and have
          the DFG use SSA. For now, so long as any new DFG optimizations we add are block-local and
          treat GetLocal/SetLocal conservatively, this should all be sound.
        
        This change should be perf-neutral although it does reduce the total work that the compiler
        does.

        VarargsForwardingPhase should only consider MovHints that have the candidate as a child

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff and Mark Lam.
        
        Since we were considering all MovHints, we'd assume that the CreateDirectArguments or
        CreateClosedArguments node was live so long as any MovHinted bytecode variable was alive.
        Basically, we'd keep it alive until the end of the block. This maximized the chances of
        there being an interfering operation, which would prevent elimination.
        
        The fix is to only consider MovHints that have the arguments candidate as a child. We only
        care to track the liveness of those bytecode locals that would need an arguments object
        recovery on OSR exit.
        
        This is a speed-up on V8Spider/raytrace and Octane/raytrace because it undoes the regression

        Function allocations shouldn't sink through Put operations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144176

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        By design, we don't support function allocation sinking through any
        related operation ; however object allocation can sink through PutByOffset et
        al.

        Currently, the checks to prevent function allocation to sink through
        these are misguided and do not prevent anything ; function allocation sinking
        through these operations is prevented as a side effect of requiring an
        AllocatePropertyStorage through which the function allocation is seen as
        escaping.

        This changes it so that ObjectAllocationSinkingPhase::handleNode()
        checks properly that only object allocations sink through related write
        operations.

        VarargsForwardingPhase should use bytecode liveness in addition to other uses to determine the last point that a candidate is used

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        It will soon come to pass that Phantom isn't available at the time that
        VarargsForwardingPhase runs. So, it needs to use some other mechanism for discovering when
        a value dies for OSR.
        
        This is simplified by two things:
        
        1) The bytecode kill analysis is now reusable. This patch makes it even more reusable than
           before by polishing the API.
        
        2) This phase already operates on one node at a time and allows itself to do a full search
           of the enclosing basic block for that node. This is fine because CreateDirectArguments
           and friends is a rarely occurring node. The fact that it operates on one node at a time
           makes it even easier to reason about OSR liveness - we just track the list of locals in
           which it is live.

        Rationalize DFG DCE handling of nodes that perform checks that propagate through AI

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        If I do ArithAdd(Int32Use, Int32Use, CheckOverflow) then AI will prove that this returns
        Int32. We may later perform code simplifications based on the proof that this is Int32, and
        we may kill all DFG users of this ArithAdd. Then we may prove that there is no exit site at
        which the ArithAdd is live. This seems like it is sufficient to then kill the ArithAdd,
        except that we still need the overflow check!

        Previously we mishandled this:

        - In places where we want the overflow check we need to use MustGenerate(@ArithAdd) as a hack
          to keep it alive. That's dirty and it's just indicative of a deeper issue.

        - Our MovHint removal doesn't do Phantom canonicalization which essentially makes it
          powerless. This was sort of hiding the bug.

        - Nodes that have checks that AI leverages should always be NodeMustGenerate. You can't kill
          something that you are relying on for subsequent simplifications.
        
        This fixes MovHint removal to also canonicalize Phantoms. This also adds ModeMustGenerate to
        nodes that may perform checks that are used by AI to guarantee the result type. As a result,
        we no longer need the weird MustGenerate node.

        [ES6] Implement ES6 template literals
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142691

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch implements TemplateLiteral.
        Since TaggedTemplate requires some global states and
        primitive operations like GetTemplateObject,
        we separate the patch. It will be implemented in a subsequent patch.

        Template Literal Syntax is guarded by ENABLE_ES6_TEMPLATE_LITERAL_SYNTAX compile time flag.
        By disabling it, we can disable Template Literal support.

        To implement template literals, in this patch,
        we newly introduces bytecode op_to_string.
        In template literals, we alternately evaluate the expression and
        perform ToString onto the result of evaluation.
        For example,

        `${f1()} ${f2()}`

        In this template literal, execution order is the following,
        1. calling f1()
        2. ToString(the result of f1())
        3. calling f2()
        4. ToString(the result of f2())

        op_strcat also performs ToString. However, performing ToString
        onto expressions are batched in op_strcat, it's not the same to the
        template literal spec. In the above example,
        ToString(f1()) should be called before calling f2().

        [JSC] Implement Math.clz32(), remove Number.clz()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144205

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        This patch adds the ES6 function Math.clz32(), and remove the non-standard
        Number.clz(). Number.clz() probably came from an older draft.

        The new function has a corresponding instrinsic: Clz32Intrinsic,
        and a corresponding DFG node: ArithClz32, optimized all the way to LLVM.

        The x86 assembler did not have countLeadingZeros32() because there is
        no native CLZ instruction on that architecture.

        I have added the version with bsr + branches for the case of zero.
        An other popular version uses cmov to handle the case of zero. I kept
        it simple since the Assembler has no support for cmov.

        It is unlikely to matter much. If the code is hot enough, LLVM picks
        something good based on the surrounding code.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        ES6 spec requires that Array.from accepts iterable objects.
        This patch introduces this functionality, Array.from accepting iterable objects.

        Currently, `isConstructor` is not used. Instead of it, `typeof thiObj === "function"` is used.
        However, it doesn't conform to the spec. While `isConstructor` queries the given object has `[[Construct]]`,
        `typeof thisObj === "function"` queries the given object has `[[Call]]`.
        This will be fixed in the subsequent patch[1].

        Changed the EdgeMayExit functor to recognize ObjectUse, ObjectOrOtherUse,

        While only the ObjectOrOtherUse kind is relevant for manifesting this bug with

        To prevent this bug from manifesting with other nodes (and future ones that
        are yet to be added to mayExits()'s "potential won't exit" set), we fix the

        We shouldn't assume that constant-like OSR exit values are always recoverable. They are only
        recoverable so long as they are live. Therefore, OSR exit should track liveness of
        constants instead of assuming that they are always live.

        It shouldn't take 1846 lines of code and 5 FIXMEs to sort an array.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch implements Array.prototype.sort in JavaScript, removing the
        C++ implementations. It is simpler and less error-prone to express our
        operations in JavaScript, which provides memory safety, exception safety,
        and recursion safety.

        The performance result is mixed, but net positive in my opinion. It's
        difficult to enumerate all the results, since we used to have so many
        different sorting modes, and there are lots of different data patterns
        across which you might want to measure sorting. Suffice it to say:

            (*) The benchmarks we track are faster or unchanged.

            (*) Sorting random input using a comparator -- which we think is
            common -- is 3X faster.

            (*) Sorting random input in a non-array object -- which jQuery does
            -- is 4X faster.

            (*) Sorting random input in a compact array of integers using a
            trivial pattern-matchable comparator is 2X *slower*.

        This is a textbook implementation of merge sort with three optimizations:

            (1) Use iteration instead of recursion;

            (2) Use array subscripting instead of array copying in order to
            create logical sub-lists without creating physical sub-lists;

            (3) Swap src and dst at each iteration instead of copying src into
            dst, and only copy src into the subject array at the end if src is

        Allow function allocation sinking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144016

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This adds the ability to sink function allocations in the
        DFGObjectAllocationSinkingPhase.

        In order to enable this, we add a new PhantomNewFunction node that is
        used similarily to the PhantomNewObject node, i.e. as a placeholder to replace
        a sunk NewFunction and keep track of the allocations that have to be performed
        in case of OSR exit after the sunk allocation but before the real one.
        The FunctionExecutable and JSLexicalEnvironment (activation) of the function
        are stored onto the PhantomNewFunction through PutHints in order for them
        to be recovered on OSR exit.

        Contrary to sunk object allocations, sunk function allocations do not
        support any kind of operations (e.g. storing into a field) ; any such operation
        will mark the function allocation as escaping and trigger materialization. As
        such, function allocations can only be sunk to places where it would have been
        correct to syntactically move them, and we don't need a special
        MaterializeNewFunction node to recover possible operations on the function. A
        sunk NewFunction node will simply create new NewFunction nodes, then replace
        itself with a PhantomNewFunction node.

        In itself, this change is not expected to have a significant impact on
        performances other than in degenerate cases (see e.g.
        JSRegress/sink-function), but it is a step towards being able to sink recursive
        closures onces we support CreateActivation sinking as well as allocation cycles
        sinking.

        Make FunctionRareData allocation thread-safe
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144001

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        The two things we want to prevent are:

         1. A thread seeing a pointer to a not-yet-fully-created rare data from
            a JSFunction
         2. A thread seeing a pointer to a not-yet-fully-created Structure from
            an ObjectAllocationProfile

        For 1., only the JS thread can be creating the rare data (in
        runtime/CommonSlowPaths.cpp or in dfg/DFGOperations.cpp), so we don't need to
        worry about concurrent writes, and we don't need any fences when *reading* the
        rare data from the JS thread. Thus we only need a storeStoreFence between the
        rare data creation and assignment to m_rareData in
        JSFunction::createAndInitializeRareData() to ensure that when the store to
        m_rareData is issued, the rare data has been properly created.

        For the DFG compilation threads, the only place they can access the
        rare data is through JSFunction::rareData(), and so we only need a
        loadLoadFence there to ensure that when we see a non-null pointer in
        m_rareData, the pointed object will be seen as a fully created
        FunctionRareData.


        For 2., the structure is created in
        ObjectAllocationProfile::initialize() (which appears to be called only by the
        JS thread as well, in bytecode/CodeBlock.cpp and on rare data initialization,
        which always happen in the JS thread), and read through
        ObjectAllocationProfile::structure() and
        ObjectAllocationProfile::inlineCapacity(), so following the same reasoning we
        put a storeStoreFence in ObjectAllocationProfile::initialize() and a
        loadLoadFence in ObjectAllocationProfile::structure() (and change
        ObjectAllocationProfile::inlineCapacity() to go through
        ObjectAllocationProfile::structure()).

        We don't need a fence in ObjectAllocationProfile::clear() because
        clearing the structure is already as atomic as it gets.

        Finally, notice that we don't care about the ObjectAllocationProfile's
        m_allocator as that is only used by ObjectAllocationProfile::initialize() and
        ObjectAllocationProfile::clear() that are always run in the JS thread.
        ObjectAllocationProfile::isNull() could cause some trouble, but it is
        currently only used in the ObjectAllocationProfile::clear()'s ASSERT in the JS
        thread.  Doing isNull()-style pre-checks would be wrong in any other concurrent
        thread anyway.

        This is no longer used, as all the accesses to the ObjectAllocationProfile go through the rare data.

        DFG should insert Phantoms late using BytecodeKills and block-local OSR availability
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143735

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        We've always had bugs arising from the fact that we would MovHint something into a local,
        and then fail to keep it alive. We would then try to keep things alive by putting Phantoms
        on those Nodes that were MovHinted. But this became increasingly tricky. Given the
        sophistication of the transformations we are doing today, this approach is just not sound
        anymore.
        
        This comprehensively fixes these bugs by having the DFG backend automatically insert
        Phantoms just before codegen based on bytecode liveness. To make this practical, this also
        makes it much faster to query bytecode liveness.
        
        It's about as perf-neutral as it gets for a change that increases compiler work without
        actually optimizing anything. Later changes will remove the old Phantom-preserving logic,
        which should then speed us up. I can't really report concrete slow-down numbers because
        they are low enough to basically be in the noise. For example, a 20-iteration run of
        SunSpider yields "maybe 0.8% slower", whatever that means.

        Rename HardPhantom to MustGenerate.

        Rubber stamped by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        We are steadily moving towards Phantom just being a backend hack in the DFG. HardPhantom
        is more than that; it's a utility for forcing the execution of otherwise killable nodes.
        NodeMustGenerate is the flag we use to indicate that something isn't killable. So this
        node should just be called MustGenerate.

        Fix assertion failure and race condition in Options::dumpSourceAtDFGTime().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143898

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        CodeBlock::dumpSource() will access SourceCode strings in a way that requires
        ref'ing of the underlying StringImpls. This is unsafe to do from arbitrary
        compilation threads because StringImpls are not thread safe. As a result, we get
        an assertion failure when we run with JSC_dumpSourceAtDFGTime=true on a debug
        build.

        This patch fixes the issue by only collecting the CodeBlock (and associated info)
        into a DeferredSourceDump record while compiling, and stashing it away in a
        deferredSourceDump list in the DeferredCompilationCallback object to be dumped
        later.

        When compilation is done, the callback object will be notified that
        compilationDidComplete().  We will dump the SourceCode strings from there. 
        Since compilationDidComplete() is guaranteed to only be called on the thread
        doing JS execution, it is safe to access the SourceCode strings there and ref
        their underlying StringImpls as needed.

        Give the heap object iterators the ability to return early.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144011

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        JSDollarVMPrototype::isValidCell() uses a heap object iterator to validate
        candidate cell pointers, and, when in use, is called a lot more often than
        the normal way those iterators are used.  As a result, I see my instrumented
        VM killed with a SIGXCPU (CPU time limit exceeded).  This patch gives the
        callback functor the ability to tell the iterators to return early when the
        functor no longer needs to continue iterating.  With this, my instrumented
        VM is useful again for debugging.

        Since heap iteration is not something that we do in a typical fast path,
        I don't expect this to have any noticeable impact on performance.

        I also renamed ObjectAddressCheckFunctor to CellAddressCheckFunctor since
        it checks JSCell addresses, not just JSObjects.

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        A function rare data (containing most notably its allocation profile) is currently
        freed and re-allocated each time the function's prototype is cleared.
        This is not optimal as it means we are invalidating the watchpoint and recompiling the
        scope each time the prototype is cleared.

        This makes it so that a single rare data is reused, clearing the underlying
        ObjectAllocationProfile instead of throwing away the whole rare data on
        .prototype updates.

        DFG should allow Phantoms after terminals
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126778

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.
        
        It's important for us to be able to place liveness-marking nodes after nodes that do
        things. These liveness-marking nodes are nops. Previously, we disallowed such nodes after
        terminals. That made things awkward, especially for Switch and Branch, which may do
        things that necessitate liveness markers (for example they might want to use a converted
        version of a value rather than the value that was MovHinted). We previously made this
        work by disallowing certain optimizations on Switch and Branch, which was probably a bad
        thing.
        
        This changes our IR to allow for the terminal to not be the last node in a block. Asking
        for the terminal involves a search. DFG::validate() checks that the nodes after the
        terminal are liveness markers that have no effects or checks.
        
        This is perf-neutral but will allow more optimizations in the future. It will also make
        it cleaner to fix https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143735.

        This disables any DCE that assumes equivalence between DFG IR uses and bytecode uses. Doing
        so is a major step towards allowing more fancy DFG transformations and also probably fixing
        some bugs.
        
        Just making MovHint a strong use would also completely disable DCE. So we mitigate this by
        introducing a MovHint removal phase that runs in FTL.
        
        This is a slight slowdown on Octane/gbemu, but it's basically neutral on suite averages.

        Add debugging tools to test if a given pointer is a valid object and in the heap.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        When doing debugging from lldb, sometimes, it is useful to be able to tell if a
        purported JSObject is really a valid object in the heap or not.  We can add the
        following utility functions to help:
            isValidCell(heap, candidate) - returns true if the candidate is a "live" cell in the heap.
            isInHeap(heap, candidate) - returns true if the candidate is the heap's Object space or Storage space.
            isInObjectSpace(heap, candidate) - returns true if the candidate is the heap's Object space.
            isInStorageSpace(heap, candidate) - returns true if the candidate is the heap's Storage space.

        Also moved lldb callable debug utility function prototypes from
        JSDollarVMPrototype.cpp to JSDollarVMPrototype.h as static members of the
        JSDollarVMPrototype class.  This is so that we can conveniently #include that
        file to get the prototypes when we need to call them programmatically from
        instrumentation that we add while debugging an issue.

        Introduce bytecode intrinsics
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143926

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch introduces bytecode level intrinsics into builtins/*.js JS code.
        When implementing functions in builtins/*.js,
        sometimes we require lower level functionality.

        For example, in the current Array.from, we use `result[k] = value`.
        The spec requires `[[DefineOwnProperty]]` operation here.
        However, usual `result[k] = value` is evaluated as `[[Set]]`. (`PutValue` => `[[Set]]`)
        So if we implement `Array.prototype[k]` getter/setter, the difference is observable.

        Ideally, reaching here, we would like to use put_by_val_direct bytecode.
        However, there's no syntax to generate it directly.

        This patch introduces bytecode level intrinsics into JSC BytecodeCompiler.
        Like @call, @apply, we introduce a new node, Intrinsic.
        These are generated when calling appropriate private symbols in privileged code.
        AST parser detects them and generates Intrinsic nodes and
        BytecodeCompiler detects them and generate required bytecodes.

        Currently, Array.from implementation works fine without this patch.
        This is because when the target code is builtin JS,
        BytecodeGenerator emits put_by_val_direct instead of put_by_val.
        This solves the above issue. However, instead of solving this issue,
        it raises another issue; There's no way to emit `[[Set]]` operation.
        `[[Set]]` operation is actually used in the spec (Array.from's "length" is set by `[[Set]]`).
        So to implement it precisely, introducing bytecode level intrinsics is necessary.

        In the subsequent fixes, we'll remove that special path emitting put_by_val_direct
        for `result[k] = value` under builtin JS environment. Instead of that special handling,
        use bytecode intrinsics instead. It solves problems and it is more intuitive
        because written JS code in builtin works as the same to the usual JS code.

        Make Builtin functions non constructible

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Builtin functions defined by builtins/*.js accidentally have [[Construct]].
        According to the spec, these functions except for explicitly defined as a constructor do not have [[Construct]].
        This patch fixes it. When the JS function used for a construction is builtin function, throw not a constructor error.

        Ideally, returning ConstructTypeNone in JSFunction::getConstructData is enough.
        However, to avoid calling getConstructData (it involves indirect call of function pointer of getConstructData), some places do not check ConstructType.
        In these places, they only check the target function is JSFunction because previously JSFunction always has [[Construct]].
        So in this patch, we check `isBuiltinFunction()` in those places.

        Except for adders (WeakMap.prototype.set/WeakSet.prototype.add),
        methods return false (or undefined for WeakMap.prototype.get)
        when a key is not Object instead of throwing a type error.

        Add $vm debugging tool.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        For debugging VM bugs, it would be useful to be able to dump VM data structures
        from JS code that we instrument.  To this end, let's introduce a
        JS_enableDollarVM option that, if true, installs an $vm property into each JS
        global object at creation time.  The $vm property refers to an object that
        provides a collection of useful utility functions.  For this initial
        implementation, $vm will have the following:

            crash() - trigger an intentional crash.

            dfgTrue() - returns true if the current function is DFG compiled, else returns false.
            jitTrue() - returns true if the current function is compiled by the baseline JIT, else returns false.
            llintTrue() - returns true if the current function is interpreted by the LLINT, else returns false.

            gc() - runs a full GC.
            edenGC() - runs an eden GC.

            codeBlockForFrame(frameNumber) - gets the codeBlock at the specified frame (0 = current, 1 = caller, etc).
            printSourceFor(codeBlock) - prints the source code for the codeBlock.
            printByteCodeFor(codeBlock) - prints the bytecode for the codeBlock.

            print(str) - prints a string to dataLog output.
            printCallFrame() - prints the current CallFrame.
            printStack() - prints the JS stack.
            printInternal(value) - prints the JSC internal info for the specified value.

        With JS_enableDollarVM=true, JS code can use the above functions like so:

            $vm.print("Using $vm features\n");

        - This file contains 2 sets of functions:

             be cautious and not cause unintended crashes should the user call them with
             the wrong info.  Hence, they are designed to be robust rather than speedy.

          b. the native implementations of JS functions in the $vm object.  Where there
             is overlapping functionality, these are built on top of the C++ functions
             above to do the work.

          Note: it does not make sense for all of the $vm functions to have a C++
          counterpart for lldb debugging.  For example, the $vm.dfgTrue() function is
          only useful for JS code, and works via the DFG intrinsics mechanism.
          When doing debugging via lldb, the optimization level of the currently
          executing JS function can be gotten by dumping the current CallFrame instead.

        [ES6] Implement Symbol.for and Symbol.keyFor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143404

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch implements Symbol.for and Symbol.keyFor.
        SymbolRegistry maintains registered StringImpl* symbols.
        And to make this mapping enabled over realms,
        VM owns this mapping (not JSGlobalObject).

        While there's Default AtomicStringTable per thread,
        SymbolRegistry should not exist over VMs.
        So everytime VM is created, SymbolRegistry is also created.

        In SymbolRegistry implementation, we don't leverage WeakGCMap (or weak reference design).
        Theres are several reasons.
        1. StringImpl* which represents identity of Symbols is not GC-managed object.
           So we cannot use WeakGCMap directly.
           While Symbol* is GC-managed object, holding weak reference to Symbol* doesn't maintain JS symbols (exposed primitive values to users) liveness,
           because distinct Symbol* can exist.
           Distinct Symbol* means the Symbol* object that pointer value (Symbol*) is different from weakly referenced Symbol* but held StringImpl* is the same.

        2. We don't use WTF::WeakPtr. If we add WeakPtrFactory into StringImpl's member, we can track StringImpl*'s liveness by WeakPtr.
           However there's problem about when we prune staled entries in SymbolRegistry.
           Since the memory allocated for the Symbol is typically occupied by allocated symbolized StringImpl*'s content,
           and it is not in GC-heap.
           While heavily registering Symbols and storing StringImpl* into SymbolRegistry, Heap's EdenSpace is not so occupied.
           So GC typically attempt to perform EdenCollection, and it doesn't call WeakGCMap's pruleStaleEntries callback.
           As a result, before pruning staled entries in SymbolRegistry, fast malloc-ed memory fills up the system memory.

        So instead of using Weak reference, we take relatively easy design.
        When we register symbolized StringImpl* into SymbolRegistry, symbolized StringImpl* is aware of that.
        And when destructing it, it removes its reference from SymbolRegistry as if atomic StringImpl do so with AtomicStringTable.

        [ES6] Use specific functions for @@iterator functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143838

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        In ES6, some methods are defined with the different names.

        For example,

        Map.prototype[Symbol.iterator] === Map.prototype.entries
        Set.prototype[Symbol.iterator] === Set.prototype.values
        Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] === Array.prototype.values
        %Arguments%[Symbol.iterator] === Array.prototype.values

        However, current implementation creates different function objects per name.
        This patch fixes it by setting the object that is used for the other method to @@iterator.
        e.g. Setting Array.prototype.values function object to Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator].

        And we drop Arguments' iterator implementation and replace Argument[@@iterator] implementation
        with Array.prototype.values to conform to the spec.

        Add JSC_functionOverrides=<overrides file> debugging tool.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143717

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This tool allows us to do runtime replacement of function bodies with alternatives
        for debugging purposes.  For example, this is useful when we need to debug VM bugs
        which manifest in scripts executing in webpages downloaded from remote servers
        that we don't control.  The tool allows us to augment those scripts with logging
        or test code to help isolate the bugs.

        This tool works by substituting the SourceCode at FunctionExecutable creation
        time.  It identifies which SourceCode to substitute by comparing the source
        string against keys in a set of key value pairs.

        The keys are function body strings defined by 'override' clauses in the overrides
        file specified by in the JSC_functionOverrides option.  The values are function
        body strings defines by 'with' clauses in the overrides file.
        See comment blob at top of FunctionOverrides.cpp on the formatting
        of the overrides file.

        At FunctionExecutable creation time, if the SourceCode string matches one of the
        'override' keys from the overrides file, the tool will replace the SourceCode with
        a new one based on the corresponding 'with' value string.  The FunctionExecutable
        will then be created with the new SourceCode instead.

        Some design decisions:
        1. We opted to require that the 'with' clause appear on a separate line than the
           'override' clause because this makes it easier to read and write when the
           'override' clause's function body is single lined and long.

        2. The user can use any sequence of characters for the delimiter (except for '{',
           '}' and white space characters) because this ensures that there can always be
           some delimiter pattern that does not appear in the function body in the clause
           e.g. in the body of strings in the JS code.

           '{' and '}' are disallowed because they are used to mark the boundaries of the
           function body string.  White space characters are disallowed because they can
           be error prone (the user may not be able to tell between spaces and tabs).

        3. The start and end delimiter must be an identical sequence of characters.

           I had considered allowing the use of complementary characters like <>, [], and
           () for making delimiter pairs like:
               [[[[ ... ]]]]
               <[([( ... )])]>

           But in the end, decided against it because:
           a. These sequences of complementary characters can exists in JS code.
              In contrast, a repeating delimiter like %%%% is unlikely to appear in JS
              code.
           b. It can be error prone for the user to have to type the exact complement
              character for the end delimiter in reverse order.
              In contrast, a repeating delimiter like %%%% is much easier to type and
              less error prone.  Even a sequence like @#$%^ is less error prone than
              a complementary sequence because it can be copy-pasted, and need not be

           we don't want any overrides to fail silently.  If a syntax error is detected,

           wasting time doing debugging only to be surprised later that their specified
           overrides did not take effect because of some unnoticed typo.

        Extract the allocation profile from JSFunction into a rare object

        The allocation profile is only needed for those functions that are used
        to create objects with [new].
        Extracting it into its own JSCell removes the need for JSFunction and
        JSCallee to be JSDestructibleObjects, which should improve performances in most
        cases at the cost of an extra pointer dereference when the allocation profile
        is actually needed.

        Unfortunately, we don't have a good way to test this yet - but it will be needed to prevent
        bugs in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143734.
        
        Previously ForAllKills used the bytecode kill analysis. That seemed like a good idea because
        that analysis is cheaper than the full liveness analysis. Unfortunately, it's probably wrong:
        
        - It looks for kill sites at forExit origin boundaries. But, something might have been killed
          by an operation that was logically in between the forExit origins at the boundary, but was
          removed from the DFG for whatever reason. The DFG is allowed to have bytecode instruction
          gaps.
        
        - It overlooked the fact that a MovHint that addresses a local that is always live kills that
          local. For example, storing to an argument means that the prior value of the argument is
          killed.
        
        This fixes the analysis by making it handle MovHints directly, and making it define kills in
        the most conservative way possible: it asks if you were live before but dead after. If we
        have the compile time budget to afford this more direct approach, then it's definitel a good
        idea since it's so fool-proof.

        JSC should detect singleton functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143232

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        This started out as an attempt to make constructors faster by detecting when a constructor is a
        singleton. The idea is that each FunctionExecutable has a VariableWatchpointSet - a watchpoint
        along with an inferred value - that detects if only one JSFunction has been allocated for that
        executable, and if so, what that JSFunction is. Then, inside the code for the FunctionExecutable,
        if the watchpoint set has an inferred value (i.e. it's been initialized and it is still valid),
        we can constant-fold GetCallee.
        
        Unfortunately, constructors don't use GetCallee anymore, so that didn't pan out. But in the
        process I realized a bunch of things:
        
        - This allows us to completely eliminate the GetCallee/GetScope sequence that we still sometimes
          had even in code where our singleton-closure detection worked. That's because singleton-closure
          inference worked at the op_resolve_scope, and that op_resolve_scope still needed to keep alive
          the incoming scope in case we OSR exit. But by constant-folding GetCallee, that sequence
          disappears. OSR exit can rematerialize the callee or the scope by just knowing their constant
          values.
          
        - Singleton detection should be a reusable thing. So, I got rid of VariableWatchpointSet and
          created InferredValue. InferredValue is a cell, so it can handle its own GC magic.
          FunctionExecutable uses an InferredValue to tell you about singleton JSFunctions.
        
        - The old singleton-scope detection in op_resolve_scope is better abstracted as a SymbolTable
          detecting a singleton JSSymbolTableObject. So, SymbolTable uses an InferredValue to tell you
          about singleton JSSymbolTableObjects. It's curious that we want to have singleton detection in
          SymbolTable if we already have it in FunctionExecutable. This comes into play in two ways.
          First, it means that the DFG can realize sooner that a resolve_scope resolves to a constant
          scope. Ths saves compile times and it allows prediction propagation to benefit from the
          constant folding. Second, it means that we will detect a singleton scope even if it is
          referenced from a non-singleton scope that is nearer to us in the scope chain. This refactoring
          allows us to eliminate the function reentry watchpoint.
        
        - This allows us to use a normal WatchpointSet, instead of a VariableWatchpointSet, for inferring
          constant values in scopes. Previously when the DFG inferred that a closure variable was
          constant, it wouldn't know which closure that variable was in and so it couldn't just load that
          value. But now we are first inferring that the function is a singleton, which means that we
          know exactly what scope it points to, and we can load the value from the scope. Using a
          WatchpointSet instead of a VariableWatchpointSet saves some memory and simplifies a bunch of
          code. This also means that now, the only user of VariableWatchpointSet is FunctionExecutable.
          I've tweaked the code of VariableWatchpointSet to reduce its power to just be what
          FunctionExecutable wants.
        
        This also has the effect of simplifying the implementation of block scoping. Prior to this
        change, block scoping would have needed to have some story for the function reentry watchpoint on
        any nested symbol table. That's totally weird to think about; it's not really a function reentry
        but a scope reentry. Now we don't have to think about this. Constant inference on nested scopes
        will "just work": if we prove that we know the constant value of the scope then the machinery
        kicks in, otherwise it doesn't.
        
        This is a small Octane and AsmBench speed-up. AsmBench sees 1% while Octane sees sub-1%.

        Don't segregate heap objects based on Structure immortality.
        <https://webkit.org/b/143638>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Put all objects that need a destructor call into the same MarkedBlock.
        This reduces memory consumption in many situations, while improving locality,
        since much more of the MarkedBlock space can be shared.

        Instead of branching on the MarkedBlock type, we now check a bit in the
        JSCell's inline type flags (StructureIsImmortal) to see whether it's safe
        to access the cell's Structure during destruction or not.

        Performance benchmarks look mostly neutral. Maybe a small regression on
        SunSpider's date objects.

        On the amazon.com landing page, this saves us 50 MarkedBlocks (3200kB) along
        with a bunch of WeakBlocks that were hanging off of them. That's on the higher
        end of savings we can get from this, but still a very real improvement.

        Most of this patch is removing the "hasImmortalStructure" constant from JSCell
        derived classes and passing that responsibility to the StructureIsImmortal flag.
        StructureFlags is made public so that it's accessible from non-member functions.
        I made sure to declare it everywhere and make classes final to try to make it
        explicit what each class is doing to its inherited flags.

        DFG inlining of op_call_varargs should keep the callee alive in case of OSR exit.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143407

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        DFG inlining of a varargs call / construct needs to keep the local
        containing the callee alive with a Phantom node because the LoadVarargs
        node may OSR exit.  After the OSR exit, the baseline JIT executes the
        op_call_varargs with that callee in the local.

        Previously, because that callee local was not explicitly kept alive,
        the op_call_varargs case can OSR exit a DFG function and leave an
        undefined value in that local.  As a result, the baseline observes the
        side effect of an op_call_varargs on an undefined value instead of the
        function it expected.

        Note: this issue does not manifest with op_construct_varargs because
        the inlined constructor will have an op_create_this which operates on
        the incoming callee value, thereby keeping it alive.

        Run flaky conservative GC related test first before polluting stack and registers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143634

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        After r182653, JSC API tests fail. However, it's not related to the change.
        After investigating the cause of this failure, I've found that the failed test is flaky
        because JSC's GC is conservative. If previously allocated JSGlobalObject is accidentally alive
        due to conservative roots in C stack and registers, this test fails.

        Since GC marks C stack and registers as roots conservatively,
        objects not referenced logically can be accidentally marked and alive.
        To avoid this situation as possible as we can,
        1. run this test first before stack is polluted,
        2. extract this test as a function to suppress stack height.

        [ES6] Enable Symbol in web pages
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143375

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Expose Symbol to web pages.
        Symbol was exposed, but it was hidden since it breaks Facebook comments.
        This is because at that time Symbol is implemented,
        but methods for Symbol.iterator and Object.getOwnPropertySymbols are not implemented yet
        and it breaks React.js and immutable.js.

        Now methods for Symbol.iterator and Object.getOwnPropertySymbols are implemented
        and make sure that Facebook comment input functionality is not broken with exposed Symbol.

        So this patch replaces runtime flags SymbolEnabled to SymbolDisabled
        and makes enabling symbols by default.

        REGRESSION (182567): regress/script-tests/sorting-benchmark.js fails on 32 bit dfg-eager tests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143582

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        For 32 bit builds, we favor spilling unboxed values.  The ASSERT at the root of this bug doesn't
        fire for 64 bit builds, because we spill an "Other" value as a full JS value (DataFormatJS).
        For 32 bit builds however, if we are able, we spill Other values as JSCell* (DataFormatCell).
        The fix is to add a check in fillSpeculateInt32Internal() before the ASSERT that always OSR exits
        if the spillFormat is DataFormatCell.  Had we spilled in DataFormatJS and the value was a JSCell*,
        we would still OSR exit after the speculation check.

        Constant folding of typed array properties should be handled by AI rather than strength reduction
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143496

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        Handling constant folding in AI is better because it precludes us from having to fixpoint the CFA
        phase and whatever other phase did the folding in order to find all constants.
        
        This also removes the TypedArrayWatchpoint node type because we can just set the watchpoint
        directly.
        
        This also fixes a bug in FTL lowering of GetTypedArrayByteOffset. The bug was previously not
        found because all of the tests for it involved the property getting constant folded. I found that
        the codegen was bad because an earlier version of the patch broke that constant folding. This
        adds a new test for that node type, which makes constant folding impossible by allocating a new
        typed array every type. The lesson here is: if you write a test for something, run the test with
        full IR dumps to make sure it's actually testing the thing you want it to test.

        Source and stack information should get appended only to native errors
        and should be added directly after construction rather than when thrown. 
        This fixes frozen objects being unfrozen when thrown while conforming to 
        ecma script standard and other browser behavior.
        rdar://problem/19927293
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141871
        
        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Appending stack, source, line, and column information to an object whenever that object is thrown 
        is incorrect because it violates the ecma script standard for the behavior of throw.  Suppose for example
        that the object being thrown already has one of these properties or is frozen.  Adding the properties 
        would then violate the frozen contract or overwrite those properties.  Other browsers do not do this,
        and doing this causes unnecessary performance hits in code with heavy use of the throw construct as
        a control flow construct rather than just an error reporting mechanism.  
        
        Because WebCore adds "native" errors which do not inherit from any JSC native error, 
        appending the error properties as a seperate call after construction of the error is required 
        to avoid having to manually truncate the stack and gather local source information due to 
        the stack being extended by a nested call to construct one of the native jsc error.

        [ES6] DFG and FTL should be aware of that StringConstructor behavior for symbols becomes different from ToString
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143424

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        In ES6, StringConstructor behavior becomes different from ToString abstract operations in the spec. (and JSValue::toString).

        ToString(symbol) throws a type error.
        However, String(symbol) produces SymbolDescriptiveString(symbol).

        So, in DFG and FTL phase, they should not inline StringConstructor to ToString.

        Now, in the template literals patch, ToString DFG operation is planned to be used.
        And current ToString behavior is aligned to the spec (and JSValue::toString) and it's better.
        So intead of changing ToString behavior, this patch adds CallStringConstructor operation into DFG and FTL.
        In CallStringConstructor, all behavior in DFG analysis is the same.
        Only the difference from ToString is, when calling DFG operation functions, it calls
        operationCallStringConstructorOnCell and operationCallStringConstructor instead of
        operationToStringOnCell and operationToString.

        Return Optional<uint32_t> from PropertyName::asIndex

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        PropertyName::asIndex returns uint32_t and use UINT_MAX as NotAnIndex.
        But it's not obvious to callers.

        This patch changes
        1. PropertyName::asIndex() to return Optional<uint32_t> and
        2. function name `asIndex()` to `parseIndex()`.
        It forces callers to check the value is index or not explicitly.

        Logically empty WeakBlocks should not pin down their MarkedBlocks indefinitely.
        <https://webkit.org/b/143210>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Since a MarkedBlock cannot be destroyed until all the WeakBlocks pointing into it are gone,
        we had a little problem where WeakBlocks with only null pointers would still keep their
        MarkedBlock alive.

        This patch fixes that by detaching WeakBlocks from their MarkedBlock once a sweep discovers
        that the WeakBlock contains no pointers to live objects. Ownership of the WeakBlock is passed
        to the Heap, which will sweep the list of these detached WeakBlocks as part of a full GC,
        destroying them once they're fully dead.

        This allows the garbage collector to reclaim the 64kB MarkedBlocks much sooner, and resolves
        a mysterious issue where doing two full garbage collections back-to-back would free additional
        memory in the second collection.

        Management of detached WeakBlocks is implemented as a Vector<WeakBlock*> in Heap, along with
        an index of the next block in that vector that needs to be swept. The IncrementalSweeper then
        calls into Heap::sweepNextLogicallyEmptyWeakBlock() to sweep one block at a time.

        * heap/Heap.cpp:

        This patch implements `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`.
        One technical issue is that, since we use private symbols (such as `@Object`) in the
        privileged JS code in `builtins/`, they should not be exposed.
        To distinguish them from the usual symbols, check the target `StringImpl*` is a not private name
        before adding it into PropertyNameArray.

        To check the target `StringImpl*` is a private name, we leverage privateToPublic map in `BuiltinNames`
        since all private symbols are held in this map.

        Enhance ability to dump JSC Options.
        <https://webkit.org/b/143357>

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Some enhancements to how the JSC options work:

        1. Add a JSC_showOptions option which take values: 0 = None, 1 = Overridden only,
           2 = All, 3 = Verbose.

           The default is 0 (None).  This dumps nothing.
           With the Overridden setting, at VM initialization time, we will dump all
           option values that have been changed from their default.
           With the All setting, at VM initialization time, we will dump all option values.
           With the Verbose setting, at VM initialization time, we will dump all option
           values along with their descriptions (if available).

        2. We now store a copy of the default option values.

           We later use this for comparison to tell if an option has been overridden, and
           print the default value for reference.  As a result, we no longer need the
           didOverride flag since we can compute whether the option is overridden at any time.

        3. Added description strings to some options to be printed when JSC_showOptions=3 (Verbose).

           This will come in handy later when we want to rename some of the options to more sane
           names that are easier to remember.  For example, we can change
           Options::dfgFunctionWhitelistFile() to Options::dfgWhiteList(), and
           Options::slowPathAllocsBetweenGCs() to Options::forcedGcRate().  With the availability
           of the description, we can afford to use shorter and less descriptive option names,
           but they will be easier to remember and use for day to day debugging work.

           In this patch, I did not change the names of any of the options yet.  I only added
           description strings for options that I know about, and where I think the option name
           isn't already descriptive enough.

        4. Also deleted some unused code.

        Also added versions of CodeBlock::dumpSource() and CodeBlock::dumpBytecode()
        that explicitly take no arguments (instead of relying on the version that takes
        the default argument).  These versions are friendlier to use when we want to call
        them from an interactive debugging session.

        2. Make ExcludeSymbols implicitly default for the existing flags
        we encapsulate EnumerationMode flags into EnumerationMode class.

        And this class manages 2 flags. Later it will be extended to 3.
        1. DontEnumPropertiesMode (default is Exclude)

        3. SymbolPropertiesMode (default is Exclude)
            SymbolPropertiesMode will be added in Object.getOwnPropertySymbols patch.

        This patch replaces places using ExcludeDontEnumProperties
        to EnumerationMode() value which represents default mode.

        IteratorClose should be called when jumping over the target for-of loop
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143140

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch fixes labeled break/continue behaviors with for-of and iterators.

        1. Support IteratorClose beyond multiple loop contexts
        Previously, IteratorClose is only executed in for-of's breakTarget().
        However, this misses IteratorClose execution when statement roll-ups multiple control flow contexts.
        For example,
        outer: for (var e1 of outer) {
            inner: for (var e2 of inner) {
                break outer;
            }
        }
        In this case, return method of inner should be called.
        We leverage the existing system for `finally` to execute inner.return method correctly.
        Leveraging `finally` system fixes `break`, `continue` and `return` cases.
        `throw` case is already supported by emitting try-catch handlers in for-of.

        2. Incorrect LabelScope creation is done in ForOfNode
        ForOfNode creates duplicated LabelScope.
        It causes infinite loop when executing the following program that contains
        explicitly labeled for-of loop.
        For example,
        inner: for (var elm of array) {
            continue inner;
        }

        [ES6] Implement Symbol.unscopables
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142829

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch introduces Symbol.unscopables functionality.
        In ES6, some generic names (like keys, values) are introduced
        as Array's method name. And this breaks the web since some web sites
        use like the following code.

        var values = ...;
        with (array) {
            values;  // This values is trapped by array's method "values".
        }

        To fix this, Symbol.unscopables introduces blacklist
        for with scope's trapping. When resolving scope,
        if name is found in the target scope and the target scope is with scope,
        we check Symbol.unscopables object to filter generic names.

        This functionality is only active for with scopes.
        Global scope does not have unscopables functionality.

        And since
        1) op_resolve_scope for with scope always return Dynamic resolve type,
        2) in that case, JSScope::resolve is always used in JIT and LLInt,
        3) the code which contains op_resolve_scope that returns Dynamic cannot be compiled with DFG and FTL,
        to implement this functionality, we just change JSScope::resolve and no need to change JIT code.
        So performance regression is only visible in Dynamic resolving case, and it is already much slow.

        Clean up Identifier factories to clarify the meaning of StringImpl*
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143146

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        In the a lot of places, `Identifier(VM*/ExecState*, StringImpl*)` constructor is used.
        However, it's ambiguous because `StringImpl*` has 2 different meanings.
        1) normal string, it is replacable with `WTFString` and
        2) `uid`, which holds `isSymbol` information to represent Symbols.
        So we dropped Identifier constructors for strings and instead, introduced 2 factory functions.
        + `Identifier::fromString(VM*/ExecState*, const String&)`.
        Just construct Identifier from strings. The symbol-ness of StringImpl* is not kept.
        + `Identifier::fromUid(VM*/ExecState*, StringImpl*)`.
        This function is used for 2) `uid`. So symbol-ness of `StringImpl*` is kept.

        And to clean up `StringImpl` which is used as uid,
        we introduce `StringKind` into `StringImpl`. There's 3 kinds
        1. StringNormal (non-atomic, non-symbol)
        2. StringAtomic (atomic, non-symbol)
        3. StringSymbol (non-atomic, symbol)
        They are mutually exclusive. And (atomic, symbol) case should not exist.

        Logically empty WeakBlocks should not pin down their MarkedBlocks indefinitely.
        <https://webkit.org/b/143210>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Since a MarkedBlock cannot be destroyed until all the WeakBlocks pointing into it are gone,
        we had a little problem where WeakBlocks with only null pointers would still keep their
        MarkedBlock alive.

        This patch fixes that by detaching WeakBlocks from their MarkedBlock once a sweep discovers
        that the WeakBlock contains no pointers to live objects. Ownership of the WeakBlock is passed
        to the Heap, which will sweep the list of these detached WeakBlocks as part of a full GC,
        destroying them once they're fully dead.

        This allows the garbage collector to reclaim the 64kB MarkedBlocks much sooner, and resolves
        a mysterious issue where doing two full garbage collections back-to-back would free additional
        memory in the second collection.

        Management of detached WeakBlocks is implemented as a Vector<WeakBlock*> in Heap, along with
        an index of the next block in that vector that needs to be swept. The IncrementalSweeper then
        calls into Heap::sweepNextLogicallyEmptyWeakBlock() to sweep one block at a time.

        eval("this.foo") causes a crash if this had not been initialized in a derived class's constructor

        The crash was caused by eval inside the constructor of a derived class not checking TDZ.

        Fixed the bug by adding a parser flag that forces the TDZ check to be always emitted when accessing "this"

        [ES6] Object type restrictions on a first parameter of several Object.* functions are relaxed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142937

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        In ES6, Object type restrictions on a first parameter of several Object.* functions are relaxed.
        In ES5 or prior, when a first parameter is not object type, these functions raise TypeError.
        But now, several functions perform ToObject onto a non-object parameter.
        And others behaves as if a parameter is a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties.
        It is described in ES6 Annex E.
        Functions different from ES5 are following.

        1. An attempt is make to coerce the argument using ToObject.
            Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor
            Object.getOwnPropertyNames
            Object.getPrototypeOf
            Object.keys

        2. Treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties.
            Object.freeze
            Object.isExtensible
            Object.isFrozen

        REGRESSION (r181993): inspector-protocol/debugger/setBreakpoint-dfg-and-modify-local.html crashes.
        <https://webkit.org/b/143105>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        With r181993, the DFG and FTL may elide the storing of the scope register.  As a result,
        on OSR exits from DFG / FTL frames where this elision has take place, we may get baseline
        JIT frames that may have its scope register not set.  The Debugger's current implementation
        which relies on the scope register is not happy about this.  For example, this results in a
        crash in the layout test inspector-protocol/debugger/setBreakpoint-dfg-and-modify-local.html.

        The fix is to disable inlining when the debugger is in use.  Also, we add Flush nodes to
        ensure that the scope register value is flushed to the register in the stack frame.

        REGRESSION: js/regress/inline-arguments-local-escape.html is flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143104

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        Created a test that is a 100% repro of the flaky failure. This test is called
        get-my-argument-by-val-for-inlined-escaped-arguments.js. It fails all of the time because it
        always causes the compiler to emit a GetMyArgumentByVal of the arguments object returned by
        the inlined function. Other than that, it's the same as inline-arguments-local-escape.
        
        Also created three more tests for three similar, but not identical, failures.
        
        Then fixed the bug: PreciseLocalClobberize was assuming that if we read(Stack) then we are
        only reading those parts of the stack that are relevant to the current semantic code origin.
        That's false after ArgumentsEliminationPhase - we might have operations on phantom arguments,
        like GetMyArgumentByVal, ForwardVarargs, CallForwardVarargs, and ConstructForwardVarargs, that
        read parts of the stack associated with the inline call frame for the phantom arguments. This
        may not be subsumed by the current semantic origin's stack area in cases that the arguments
        were allowed to "locally" escape.
        
        The higher-order lesson here is that in DFG SSA IR, the current semantic origin's stack area
        is not really a meaningful concept anymore. It is only meaningful for nodes that will read
        the stack due to function.arguments, but there are a bunch of other ways that we could also
        read the stack and those operations may read any stack slot. I believe that this change makes
        PreciseLocalClobberize right: it will refine a read(Stack) from Clobberize correctly by casing
        on node type. In future, if we add a read(Stack) to Clobberize, we'll have to make sure that
        readTop() in PreciseLocalClobberize does the right thing.

        Insert exception check around toPropertyKey call
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142922

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        In some places, exception check is missing after/before toPropertyKey.
        However, since it calls toString, it's observable to users,

        Missing exception checks in Object.prototype methods can be
        observed since it would be overridden with toObject(null/undefined) errors.
        We inserted exception checks after toPropertyKey.

        Missing exception checks in GetById related code can be
        observed since it would be overridden with toObject(null/undefined) errors.
        In this case, we need to insert exception checks before/after toPropertyKey
        since RequireObjectCoercible followed by toPropertyKey can cause exceptions.

        JSValue::get checks null/undefined and raise an exception if |this| is null or undefined.
        However, we need to check whether the baseValue is object coercible before executing JSValue::toPropertyKey.
        According to the spec, we first perform RequireObjectCoercible and check the exception.
        And second, we perform ToPropertyKey and check the exception.
        Since JSValue::toPropertyKey can cause toString call, this is observable to users.
        For example, if the target is not object coercible,
        ToPropertyKey should not be executed, and toString should not be executed by ToPropertyKey.
        So the order of observable actions (RequireObjectCoercible and ToPropertyKey) should be correct to the spec.

        This patch introduces JSValue::requireObjectCoercible and use it because of the following 2 reasons.

        1. Using toObject instead of requireObjectCoercible produces unnecessary wrapper object.

        toObject converts primitive types into wrapper objects.
        But it is not efficient since wrapper objects are not necessary
        if we look up methods from primitive values's prototype. (using synthesizePrototype is better).

        2. Using the result of toObject is not correct to the spec.

        To align to the spec correctly, we cannot use JSObject::get
        by using the wrapper object produced by the toObject suggested in (1).
        If we use JSObject that is converted by toObject, getter will be called by using this JSObject as |this|.
        It is not correct since getter should be called with the original |this| value that may be primitive types.

        So in this patch, we use JSValue::requireObjectCoercible
        to check the target is object coercible and raise an error if it's not.

        Heap variables shouldn't end up in the stack frame
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141174

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        This is a major change to how JavaScriptCore handles declared variables (i.e. "var"). It removes
        any ambiguity about whether a variable should be in the heap or on the stack. A variable will no
        longer move between heap and stack during its lifetime. This enables a bunch of optimizations and
        simplifications:
        
        - Accesses to variables no longer need checks or indirections to determine where the variable is
          at that moment in time. For example, loading a closure variable now takes just one load instead
          of two. Loading an argument by index now takes a bounds check and a load in the fastest case
          (when no arguments object allocation is required) while previously that same operation required
          a "did I allocate arguments yet" check, a bounds check, and then the load.
        
        - Reasoning about the allocation of an activation or arguments object now follows the same simple
          logic as the allocation of any other kind of object. Previously, those objects were lazily
          allocated - so an allocation instruction wasn't the actual allocation site, since it might not
          allocate anything at all. This made the implementation of traditional escape analyses really
          awkward, and ultimately it meant that we missed important cases. Now, we can reason about the
          arguments object using the usual SSA tricks which allows for more comprehensive removal.
        
        - The allocations of arguments objects, functions, and activations are now much faster. While
          this patch generally expands our ability to eliminate arguments object allocations, an earlier
          version of the patch - which lacked that functionality - was a progression on some arguments-
          and closure-happy benchmarks because although no allocations were eliminated, all allocations
          were faster.
        
        - There is no tear-off. The runtime no loner needs to know about where on the stack a frame keeps
          its arguments objects or activations. The runtime doesn't have to do things to the arguments
          objects and activations that a frame allocated, when the frame is unwound. We always had horrid
          bugs in that code, so it's good to see it go. This removes *a ton* of machinery from the DFG,
          FTL, CodeBlock, and other places. All of the things having to do with "captured variables" is
          now gone. This also enables implementing block-scoping. Without this change, block-scope
          support would require telling CodeBlock and all of the rest of the runtime about all of the
          variables that store currently-live scopes. That would have been so disastrously hard that it
          might as well be impossible. With this change, it's fair game for the bytecode generator to
          simply allocate whatever activations it wants, wherever it wants, and to keep them live for
          however long it wants. This all works, because after bytecode generation, an activation is just
          an object and variables that refer to it are just normal variables.
        
        - SymbolTable can now tell you explicitly where a variable lives. The answer is in the form of a
          VarOffset object, which has methods like isStack(), isScope(), etc. VirtualRegister is never
          used for offsets of non-stack variables anymore. We now have shiny new objects for other kinds
          of offsets - ScopeOffset for offsets into scopes, and DirectArgumentsOffset for offsets into
          an arguments object.
        
        - Functions that create activations can now tier-up into the FTL. Previously they couldn't. Also,
          using activations used to prevent inlining; now functions that use activations can be inlined
          just fine.
        
        This is a >1% speed-up on Octane. This is a >2% speed-up on CompressionBench. This is a tiny
        speed-up on AsmBench (~0.4% or something). This looks like it might be a speed-up on SunSpider.
        It's only a slow-down on very short-running microbenchmarks we had previously written for our old
        style of tear-off-based arguments optimization. Those benchmarks are not part of any major suite.
        
        The easiest way of understanding this change is to start by looking at the changes in runtime/,
        and then the changes in bytecompiler/, and then sort of work your way up the compiler tiers.

        Use JITCompilationCanFail in more places, and make the fail path of JITCompilationMustSucceed a crash instead of attempting GC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142993

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen and Mark Lam.
        
        This changes the most commonly invoked paths that relied on JITCompilationMustSucceed
        into using JITCompilationCanFail and having a legit fallback path. This mostly involves
        having the FTL JIT do the same trick as the DFG JIT in case of any memory allocation
        failure, but also involves adding the same kind of thing to the stub generators in
        Repatch.
        
        Because of that change, there are relatively few uses of JITCompilationMustSucceed. Most
        of those uses cannot handle a GC, and so cannot do releaseExecutableMemory(). Only a few,
        like host call stub generation, could handle a GC, but those get invoked very rarely. So,
        this patch changes the releaseExecutableMemory() call into a crash with some diagnostic
        printout.
        
        Also add a way of inducing executable allocation failure, so that we can test this.

        REGRESSION(169139): LLINT intermittently fails JSC testapi tests.
        <https://webkit.org/b/135719>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This is a regression introduced in http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/169139 which
        changed VM::watchdog from an embedded field into a std::unique_ptr, but did not
        update the LLINT to access it as such.

        The issue has only manifested so far on the CLoop tests because those are LLINT
        only.  In the non-CLoop cases, the JIT kicks in and does the right thing, thereby
        hiding the bug in the LLINT.

        New map and set modification tests in r181922 fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143031

        Reviewed and tweaked by Geoffrey Garen.

        When packing Map/Set backing store, we need to decrement Map/Set iterator's m_index
        to adjust for the packed backing store.

        Consider the following map data.

        x: deleted, o: exists
        0 1 2 3 4
        x x x x o

        And iterator with m_index 3.

        When packing the map data, map data will become,

        0
        o

        At that time, we perfom didRemoveEntry 4 times on iterators.
        times => m_index/index/result
        1 => 3/0/dec
        2 => 2/1/dec
        3 => 1/2/nothing
        4 => 1/3/nothing

        After iteration, iterator's m_index becomes 1. But we expected that becomes 0.
        This is because if we use decremented m_index for comparison,
        while provided deletedIndex is the index in old storage, m_index is the index in partially packed storage.

        In this patch, we compare against the packed index instead.
        times => m_index/packedIndex/result
        1 => 3/0/dec
        2 => 2/0/dec
        3 => 1/0/dec
        4 => 0/0/nothing

        So m_index becomes 0 as expected.

        And according to the spec, once the iterator is closed (becomes done: true),
        its internal [[Map]]/[[Set]] is set to undefined.
        So after the iterator is finished, we don't revive the iterator (e.g. by clearing m_index = 0).

        In this patch, we change 2 things.
        1.
        Compare an iterator's index against the packed index when removing an entry.

        2.
        If the iterator is closed (isFinished()), we don't apply adjustment to the iterator.

        Before r142556, JSSetIterator::destroy was not defined.
        So accidentally MapData::const_iterator in JSSet was never destroyed.
        But it had non trivial destructor, decrementing MapData->m_iteratorCount.

        After r142556, JSSetIterator::destroy works.
        It correctly destruct MapData::const_iterator and m_iteratorCount partially works.
        But JSSetIterator::~JSSetIterator requires owned JSSet since it mutates MapData->m_iteratorCount.

        It is guaranteed that JSSet is live since JSSetIterator has a reference to JSSet
        and marks it in visitChildren (WriteBarrier<Unknown>).
        However, the order of destructions is not guaranteed in GC-ed system.

        Consider the following case,
        allocate JSSet and subsequently allocate JSSetIterator.
        And they resides in the separated MarkedBlock, <1> and <2>.

        JSSet<1> <- JSSetIterator<2>

        And after that, when performing GC, Marker decides that the above 2 objects are not marked.
        And Marker also decides MarkedBlocks <1> and <2> can be sweeped.

        First Sweeper sweep <1>, destruct JSSet<1> and free MarkedBlock<1>.
        Second Sweeper sweep <2>, attempt to destruct JSSetIterator<2>.
        However, JSSetIterator<2>'s destructor,
        JSSetIterator::~JSSetIterator requires live JSSet<1>, it causes use-after-free.

        In this patch, we introduce WeakGCMap into JSMap/JSSet to track live iterators.
        When packing the removed elements in JSSet/JSMap, we apply the change to all live
        iterators tracked by WeakGCMap.

        WeakGCMap can only track JSCell since they are managed by GC.
        So we drop JSSet/JSMap C++ style iterators. Instead of C++ style iterator, this patch
        introduces JS style iterator signatures into C++ class IteratorData.
        If we need to iterate over JSMap/JSSet, use JSSetIterator/JSMapIterator instead of using
        IteratorData directly.

        REGRESSION (172175-172177): Change in for...in processing causes properties added in loop to be enumerated
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142856

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Refactored the way the for .. in enumeration over objects is done.  We used to make three C++ calls to
        get info for three loops to iterate over indexed properties, structure properties and other properties,
        respectively.  We still have the three loops, but now we make one C++ call to get all the info needed
        for all loops before we exectue any enumeration.

        The JSPropertyEnumerator has a count of the indexed properties and a list of named properties.
        The named properties are one list, with structured properties in the range [0,m_endStructurePropertyIndex)
        and the generic properties in the range [m_endStructurePropertyIndex, m_endGenericPropertyIndex);

        Eliminated the bytecodes op_get_structure_property_enumerator, op_get_generic_property_enumerator and
        op_next_enumerator_pname.
        Added the bytecodes op_get_property_enumerator, op_enumerator_structure_pname and op_enumerator_generic_pname.
        The bytecodes op_enumerator_structure_pname and op_enumerator_generic_pname are similar except for what
        end value we stop iterating on.

        Made corresponding node changes to the DFG and FTL for the bytecode changes.

        JSC should have a low-cost asynchronous disassembler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142997

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.
        
        This adds a JSC_asyncDisassembly option that disassembles on a thread. Disassembly
        doesn't block execution. Some code will live a little longer because of this, since the
        work tasks hold a ref to the code, but other than that there is basically no overhead.
        
        At present, this isn't really a replacement for JSC_showDisassembly, since it doesn't
        provide contextual IR information for Baseline and DFG disassemblies, and it doesn't do
        the separate IR dumps for FTL. Using JSC_showDisassembly and friends along with
        JSC_asyncDisassembly has bizarre behavior - so just choose one.
        
        A simple way of understanding how great this is, is to run a small benchmark like
        V8Spider/earley-boyer.
        
        Performance without any disassembly flags: 60ms
        Performance with JSC_showDisassembly=true: 477ms
        Performance with JSC_asyncDisassembly=true: 65ms
        
        So, the overhead of disassembly goes from 8x to 8%.
        
        Note that JSC_asyncDisassembly=true does make it incorrect to run "time" as a way of
        measuring benchmark performance. This is because at VM exit, we wait for all async
        disassembly requests to finish. For example, for earley-boyer, we spend an extra ~130ms
        after the benchmark completely finishes to finish the disassemblies. This small weirdness

        DFG OSR exit shouldn't assume that the frame count for exit is greater than the frame count in DFG
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142948

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.
        
        It's necessary to ensure that the stack pointer accounts for the extent of our stack usage
        since a signal may clobber the area below the stack pointer. When the DFG is executing,
        the stack pointer accounts for the DFG's worst-case stack usage. When we OSR exit back to
        baseline, we will use a different amount of stack. This is because baseline is a different
        compiler. It will make different decisions. So it will use a different amount of stack.
        
        This gets tricky when we are in the process of doing an OSR exit, because we are sort of
        incrementally transforming the stack from how it looked in the DFG to how it will look in
        baseline. The most conservative approach would be to set the stack pointer to the max of
        DFG and baseline.
        
        When this code was written, a reckless assumption was made: that the stack usage in
        baseline is always at least as large as the stack usage in DFG. Based on this incorrect
        assumption, the code first adjusts the stack pointer to account for the baseline stack
        usage. This sort of usually works, because usually baseline does happen to use more stack.
        But that's not an invariant. Nobody guarantees this. We will never make any changes that
        would make this be guaranteed, because that would be antithetical to how optimizing
        compilers work. The DFG should be allowed to use however much stack it decides that it
        should use in order to get good performance, and it shouldn't try to guarantee that it
        always uses less stack than baseline.
        
        As such, we must always assume that the frame size for DFG execution (i.e.
        frameRegisterCount) and the frame size in baseline once we exit (i.e.
        requiredRegisterCountForExit) are two independent quantities and they have no
        relationship.
        
        Fortunately, though, this code can be made correct by just moving the stack adjustment to
        just before we do conversions. This is because we have since changed the OSR exit
        algorithm to first lift up all state from the DFG state into a scratch buffer, and then to
        drop it out of the scratch buffer and into the stack according to the baseline layout. The
        point just before conversions is the point where we have finished reading the DFG frame
        and will not read it anymore, and we haven't started writing the baseline frame. So, at
        this point it is safe to set the stack pointer to account for the frame size at exit.
        
        This is benign because baseline happens to create larger frames than DFG.

        The stress test harness runs all of these tests in various configurations. This includes
        no-cjit, which has tier-up heuristics locked in such a way that 10,000 iterations is
        enough to get to the highest tier. The only exceptions are very large functions or
        functions that have some reoptimizations. That happens rarely, and when it does happen,
        usually 20,000 iterations is enough.
        
        Therefore, these tests use 10x too many iterations. This is bad, since these tests
        allocate on each iteration, and so they run very slowly in debug mode.

        Observably effectful nodes in DFG IR should come last in their bytecode instruction (i.e. forExit section), except for Hint nodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142920

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt, Geoffrey Garen, and Mark Lam.
        
        Observably effectful, n.: If we reexecute the bytecode instruction after this node has
        executed, then something other than the bytecode instruction's specified outcome will
        happen.

        We almost never had observably effectful nodes except at the end of the bytecode
        instruction.  The exception is a lowered transitioning PutById:

        PutStructure(@o, S1 -> S2)
        PutByOffset(@o, @o, @v)

        The PutStructure is observably effectful: if you try to reexecute the bytecode after
        doing the PutStructure, then we'll most likely crash.  The generic PutById handling means
        first checking what the old structure of the object is; but if we reexecute, the old
        structure will seem to be the new structure.  But the property ensured by the new
        structure hasn't been stored yet, so any attempt to load it or scan it will crash.

        Intriguingly, however, none of the other operations involved in the PutById are
        observably effectful.  Consider this example:

        PutByOffset(@o, @o, @v)
        PutStructure(@o, S1 -> S2)

        Note that the PutStructure node doesn't reallocate property storage; see further below
        for an example that does that. Because no property storage is happening, we know that we
        already had room for the new property.  This means that the PutByOffset is no observable
        until the PutStructure executes and "reveals" the property.  Hence, PutByOffset is not
        observably effectful.

        Now consider this:

        b: AllocatePropertyStorage(@o)
        PutByOffset(@b, @o, @v)
        PutStructure(@o, S1 -> S2)

        Surprisingly, this is also safe, because the AllocatePropertyStorage is not observably
        effectful. It *does* reallocate the property storage and the new property storage pointer
        is stored into the object. But until the PutStructure occurs, the world will just think
        that the reallocation didn't happen, in the sense that we'll think that the property
        storage is using less memory than what we just allocated. That's harmless.

        The AllocatePropertyStorage is safe in other ways, too. Even if we GC'd after the
        AllocatePropertyStorage but before the PutByOffset (or before the PutStructure),
        everything could be expected to be fine, so long as all of @o, @v and @b are on the
        stack. If they are all on the stack, then the GC will leave the property storage alone
        (so the extra memory we just allocated would be safe). The GC will not scan the part of
        the property storage that contains @v, but that's fine, so long as @v is on the stack.
        
        The better long-term solution is probably bug 142921.
        
        But for now, this:
        
        - Fixes an object materialization bug, exemplified by the two tests, that previously
          crashed 100% of the time with FTL enabled and concurrent JIT disabled.
        
        - Allows us to remove the workaround introduced in r174856.

        This patch changes the result type of JSValue::toPropertyName from PropertyName to Identifier,

        And receive the result value as Identifier type to keep ownership in the caller side.

        Function.prototype.toString should not decompile the AST

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        To recover the function parameter string, Function.prototype.toString
        decompiles the function parameters from the AST. This is bad for a few
        reasons:

        (1) It requires us to keep pieces of the AST live forever. This is an
        awkward design and a waste of memory.

        (2) It doesn't match Firefox or Chrome (because it changes whitespace
        and ES6 destructuring expressions).

        (3) It doesn't scale to ES6 default argument parameters, which require
        arbitrarily complex decompilation.

        (4) It can counterfeit all the line numbers in a function (because
        whitespace can include newlines).

        (5) It's expensive, and we've seen cases where websites invoke
        Function.prototype.toString a lot by accident.

        The fix is to do what we do for the rest of the function: Just quote the
        original source text.

        Since this change inevitably changes some function stringification, I
        took the opportunity to make our stringification match Firefox's and

        JSCallbackObject<JSGlobalObject> should not destroy its JSCallbackObjectData before all its finalizers have been called.
        <https://webkit.org/b/142846>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Currently, JSCallbackObject<JSGlobalObject> registers weak finalizers via 2 mechanisms:
        1. JSCallbackObject<Parent>::init() registers a weak finalizer for all JSClassRef
           that a JSCallbackObject references.
        2. JSCallbackObject<JSGlobalObject>::create() registers a finalizer via
           vm.heap.addFinalizer() which destroys the JSCallbackObject.

        The first finalizer is implemented as a virtual function of a JSCallbackObjectData
        instance that will be destructed if the 2nd finalizer is called.  Hence, if the
        2nd finalizer if called first, the later invocation of the 1st finalizer will
        result in a crash.

        This patch fixes the issue by eliminating the finalizer registration in init().
        Instead, we'll have the JSCallbackObject destructor call all the JSClassRef finalizers
        if needed.  This ensures that these finalizers are called before the JSCallbackObject
        is destructor.

        Also added assertions to a few Heap functions because JSCell::classInfo() expects
        all objects that are allocated from MarkedBlock::Normal blocks to be derived from
        JSDestructibleObject.  These assertions will help us catch violations of this
        expectation earlier.

        Built-in functions should know that they use strict mode

        Even though all of our builtin functions use strict mode, the parser
        thinks that they don't. This is because Executable::toStrictness treats

        The fix is to disambiguate builtin-ness from strict-ness.

        DFG IR shouldn't have a separate node for every kind of put hint that could be described using PromotedLocationDescriptor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142769

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        When we sink an object allocation, we need to have some way of tracking what stores would
        have happened had the allocation not been sunk, so that we know how to rematerialize the
        object on OSR exit. Prior to this change, trunk had two ways of describing such a "put
        hint":
        
        - The PutStrutureHint and PutByOffsetHint node types.
        - The PromotedLocationDescriptor class, which has an enum with cases StructurePLoc and
          NamedPropertyPLoc.
        
        We also had ways of converting from a Node with those two node types to a
        PromotedLocationDescriptor, and we had a way of converting a PromotedLocationDescriptor to
        a Node.
        
        This change removes the redundancy. We now have just one node type that corresponds to a
        put hint, and it's called PutHint. It has a PromotedLocationDescriptor as metadata.
        Converting between a PutHint node and a PromotedLocationDescriptor and vice-versa is now
        trivial.
        
        This means that if we add new kinds of sunken objects, we'll have less pro-forma to write
        for the put hints to those objects. This is mainly to simplify the implementation of
        arguments elimination in bug 141174.

        DFG::PutStackSinkingPhase should eliminate GetStacks that have an obviously known source, and emit GetStacks when the stack's value is needed and none is deferred
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141624

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Not eliminating GetStacks was an obvious omission from the original PutStackSinkingPhase.
        Previously, we would treat GetStacks conservatively and assume that the stack slot
        escaped. That's pretty dumb, since a GetStack is a local load of the stack. This change
        makes GetStack a no-op from the standpoint of this phase's deferral analysis. At the end
        we either keep the GetStack (if there was no concrete deferral) or we replace it with an
        identity over the value that would have been stored by the deferred PutStack. Note that
        this might be a Phi that the phase creates, so this is strictly stronger than what GCSE
        could do.
        
        But this change revealed the fact that this phase never correctly handled side effects in
        case that we had done a GetStack, then a side-effect, and then found ourselves wanting the
        value on the stack due to (for example) a Phi on a deferred PutStack and that GetStack.
        Basically, it's only correct to use the SSA converter's incoming value mapping if we have
        a concrete deferral - since anything but a concrete deferral may imply that the value has
        been clobbered.
        
        This has no performance change. I believe that the bug was previously benign because we
        have so few operations that clobber the stack anymore, and most of those get used in a
        very idiomatic way. The GetStack elimination will be very useful for the varargs
        simplification that is part of bug 141174.
        
        This includes a test for the case that Speedometer hit, plus tests for the other cases I
        thought of once I realized the deeper issue.

        I noticed in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142636 that a GC

        I tried to figure out whether this could cause problems or not and it
        made me cross-eyed.

        (Some clients like to report extra memory cost during deallocation as a
        way to indicate that the GC now owns something exclusively. It's
        arguably a bug to communicate with the GC in this way, but we shouldn't
        do crazy when this happens.)

        This patch makes explicit the fact that we don't allow GC while sweeping.

        Bytecode liveness analysis should have more lambdas and fewer sets

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.
        
        In bug 141174 I'll need to identify all of the bytecode kill sites. This requires hooking into
        the bytecode analysis' stepOverFunction method, except in such a way that we observe uses that
        are not in outs. This refactors stepOverFunction so that you can pass it use/def functors that
        can either be used to propagate outs (as we do right now) or to additionally detect kills or
        whatever else.
        
        In order to achieve this, the liveness analysis was moved off of maintaining uses/defs
        bitvectors. This wasn't helping the abstraction and was probably inefficient. The new code
        should be a bit faster since we don't have to clear uses/defs bitvectors on each instruction. On
        the other hand, being able to intercept each use means that our code for exception handlers is
        no longer a bitwise-merge; it requires finding set bits. Fortunately, this code only kicks in
        for instructions inside a try, and its performance is O(live at catch), so that's probably not

        DFG and FTL implementations co-authored by Filip Pizlo.

        In ES6 class syntax, "this" register must be in the "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) and throw ReferenceError until
        super() is called inside the constructor of a derived class.

        Added op_check_tdz, a new OP code, which throws a reference error when the first operand is an empty value
        to all tiers of JIT and LLint. The op code throws in the slow path on the basis that a TDZ error should be
        a programming error and not a part of the programs' normal control flow. In DFG, this op code is represented
        by a no-op must-generate node CheckNotEmpty modeled after CheckCell.

        Also made the constructor of a derived class assign the empty value to "this" register rather than undefined
        so that ThisNode can emit the op_check_tdz to check the initialized-ness of "this" in such a constructor.

        Integrate MapData into JSMap and JSSet
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142556

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch integrates MapData into JSMap and JSSet.
        This removes 2 object allocation per one JSMap / JSSet.

        MapDataImpl is specialized into MapData and SetData.
        In the case of SetData, it does not have the dummy values
        previously stored in the MapDataImpl. So the storage size of SetData
        becomes the half of the previous implementation.

        And now MapData and SetData are completely integrated into JSMap and JSSet,
        these structures are not exposed to the other code even in WebCore world.

        And at the same time, this patch fixes missing destroy functions
        in JSMapIterator and JSSetIterator.
        They are needed because MapData::const_iterator is a non-trivial destructor.

        Eden collections should trigger sweep of MarkedBlocks containing new objects.
        <https://webkit.org/b/142538>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Take a snapshot of all MarkedBlocks with new objects as part of Eden collections,
        and append that to the IncrementalSweeper's working set.

        This ensures that we run destructors for objects that were discovered to be garbage during
        Eden collections, instead of delaying their teardown until the next full collection,
        or the next allocation cycle for their block.

        * heap/Heap.cpp:
        (JSC::Heap::snapshotMarkedSpace): For Eden collections, snapshot the list of MarkedBlocks
        that contain new objects, since those are the only ones we're interested in.
        Also use Vector::resizeToFit() to allocate the snapshot for full collections, since we know
        the final size we need up front.

        (JSC::Heap::notifyIncrementalSweeper): For Eden collections, tell the IncrementalSweeper
        to add the block snapshot (taken earlier) to its existing set of blocks instead of replacing
        it entirely. This allows Eden collections and incremental sweeping to occur interleaved with
        each other without missing destruction opportunities.

        Upgrade Map, Set and WeakMap constructor interface
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142348

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        In the latest ES6 spec, Map and Set constructors take initialization data sets
        as iterable value. And iterate it and add the values into the constructed one.

        This is breaking change because the old constructor interface is
        already shipped in Safari 8.

        Stale entries in WeakGCMaps are keeping tons of WeakBlocks alive unnecessarily.
        <https://webkit.org/b/142115>
        <rdar://problem/19992268>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Prune stale entries from WeakGCMaps as part of every full garbage collection.
        This frees up tons of previously-stuck WeakBlocks that were only sitting around
        with finalized handles waiting to die.

        Note that WeakGCMaps register/unregister themselves with the GC heap in their
        ctor/dtor, so creating one now requires passing the VM.

        Average time spent in the PruningStaleEntriesFromWeakGCMaps GC phase appears
        to be between 0.01ms and 0.3ms, though I've seen a few longer ones at ~1.2ms.
        It seems somewhat excessive to do this on every Eden collection, so it's only
        doing work in full collections for now.

        Because the GC may now mutate WeakGCMap below object allocation, I've made it
        so that the classic HashMap::add() optimization can't be used with WeakGCMap.
        This caused intermittent test failures when originally landed due to having
        an invalid iterator on the stack after add() inserted a new entry and we
        proceeded to allocate the new object, triggering GC.

        Upgrade ES6 Iterator interfaces
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141351

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch upgrades the exising ES6 iterator to align the latest spec.
        In the latest spec,
        1. `Iterator.next` returns object that implements IteratorResult interface { value: value, done, boolean }.
        2. `Iterator.return` is introduced. When the iteration is terminated by the abrupt completion,
        it is called to close iterator state.
        3. Iterator.next of Array is moved from an iterator object to `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%`.

        To upgrade it, we changes the bytecode that represents for-of loops.
        And to embody the efficient iteration with an iterator object,
        we implemented %ArrayIteratorPrototype%.next in JavaScript and
        it is located in builtins/ArrayIterator.prototype.js.
        Implementing it in JavaScript encourages inlining and
        utilizes escape analysis for an iterator result object in DFG JIT.
        And we dropped the intrinsic version of %ArrayIteratorPrototype%.next.

        And we introduced IteratorOperations that is defined in the spec.
        It aligns the iteration in the runtime to the latest spec.
        Currently, Promise.all and Promise.race uses an iterable object.
        However, Promise.all and Promise.race implementation is also based on the old spec.
        Subsequent patches will upgrade it.

        Hide Promise with runtime flags under Cocoa JSContext API

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Since there's no run loop in JavaScriptCore APIs, Promises don't work currently.
        So until they work, we hide Promise from a global object.
        Introduce new JSC runtime flag, PromiseDisabled. When `isPromiseDisabled` is true,
        Promise constructor is not attached to JSGlobalObject.

        To make 0 as default runtime flags, we choose PromiseDisabled flag
        instead of PromiseEnabled flag. So by default, Promise is enabled.

        Make Heap::collect() a wrapper function around a collectImpl() where the work is actually done.
        The wrapper function that grabs a snapshot of the current stack boundaries and register values

        This is a speculative fix for what appears to be overly conservative behavior in the garbage
        collector following r178364 which caused a measurable regression in memory usage on Membuster.
        The theory being that we were putting pointers to dead things on the stack before scanning it,

        [JSC] Add a node for Math.log()

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch adds the DFG node ArithLog for LogIntrinsic.

        Having a direct call to log has very little value by itself, the implementation
        in DFG and FTL is a simple function call.

        What is useful in ArithLog is that we know the operation is pure.
        This allow us to hoist it out of loops when the argument is independent
        is an invariant of the loop.

        DFG IR should refer to FunctionExecutables directly and not via the CodeBlock
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142229

        Reviewed by Mark Lam and Benjamin Poulain.
        
        Anytime a DFG IR node refers to something in CodeBlock, it has three effects:

        - Cumbersome API for accessing the thing that the node refers to.
        
        - Not obvious how to create a new such node after bytecode parsing, especially if the
          thing it refers to isn't already in the CodeBlock. We have done this in the past, but
          it usually involves subtle changes to CodeBlock.
        
        - Not obvious how to inline code that ends up using such nodes. Again, when we have done
          this, it involved subtle changes to CodeBlock.
        
        Prior to this change, the NewFunction* node types used an index into tables in CodeBlock.
        For this reason, those operations were not inlineable. But the functin tables in CodeBlock
        just point to FunctionExecutables, which are cells; this means that we can just abstract
        these operands in DFG IR as cellOperands. cellOperands use DFG::FrozenValue, which means
        that GC registration happens automagically. Even better, our dumping for cellOperand
        already did FunctionExecutable dumping - so that functionality gets to be deduplicated.
        
        Because this change increases the number of users of cellOperand, it also adds some
        convenience methods for using it. For example, whereas before you'd say things like:
        
            jsCast<Foo*>(node->cellOperand()->value())
        
        you can now just say:
        
            node->castOperand<Foo*>()
        
        This change also changes existing cellOperand users to use the new conveniance API when
        applicable.

        DelayedReleaseScope drops locks during GC which can cause a thread switch and code reentry
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141275

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The original issue is that the CodeCache uses an unsafe method to add new UnlinkedCodeBlocks.
        It basically adds a null UnlinkedCodeBlock if there isn't a cached entry and then later
        updates the null entry to the result of the compilation.  If during that compilation and
        related processing we need to garbage collect, the DelayedReleaseScope would drop locks
        possibly allowing another thread to try to get the same source out of the CodeCache.
        This second thread would find the null entry and crash.  The fix is to move the processing of
        DelayedReleaseScope to when we drop locks and not drop locks during GC.  That was done in
        the original patch with the new function releaseDelayedReleasedObjects().

        Updated releaseDelayedReleasedObjects() so that objects are released with all locks
        dropped.  Now its processing follows these steps
            Increment recursion counter and do recursion check and exit if recursing
            While there are objects to release
                ASSERT that lock is held by current thread
                Take all items from delayed release Vector and put into temporary Vector
                Release API lock
                Release and clear items from temporary vector
                Reaquire API lock
        This meets the requirement that we release while the API lock is released and it is
        safer processing of the delayed release Vector.

        Added new regression test to testapi.

        Also added comment describing how recursion into releaseDelayedReleasedObjects() is
        prevented.

        DFG should constant fold GetScope, and accesses to the scope register in the ByteCodeParser should not pretend that it's a constant as that breaks OSR exit liveness tracking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106202

        Rubber stamped by Benjamin Poulain.
        
        This fixes a bug discovered by working on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142229,
        which was in turn discovered by working on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141174.
        Our way of dealing with scopes known to be constant is very sketchy, and only really works
        when a function is inlined. When it is, we pretend that every load of the scopeRegister sees
        a constant. But this breaks the DFG's tracking of the liveness of the scopeRegister. The way
        this worked made us miss oppportunities for optimizing based on a constant scope, and it also
        meant that in some cases - particularly like when we inline code that uses NewFuction and
        friends, as I do in bug 142229 - it makes OSR exit think that the scope is dead even though
        it's most definitely alive and it's a constant.
        
        The problem here is that we were doing too many optimizations in the ByteCodeParser, and not
        later. Later optimization phases know how to preserve OSR exit liveness. They're actually
        really good at it. Also, later phases know how to infer that any variable is a constant no
        matter how that constant arose - rather than the inlining-specific thing in ByteCodeParser.
        
        This changes the ByteCodeParser to largely avoid doing constant folding on the scope, except
        making the GetScope operation itself a constant. This is a compilation-time hack for small
        functions, and it doesn't break the loads of local variables - so OSR exit liveness still
        sees that the scopeRegister is in use. This then adds a vastly more powerful GetScope and
        GetClosureVar constant folder in the AbstractInterpreter. This handles most general cases
        including those that arise in complex control flow. This will catch cases where the scope
        is constant for any number of reasons. Basically anytime that the callee is inferred constant
        this will give us a constant scope. Also, we still have the parse-time constant folding of
        ResolveScope based on the reentry watchpoint, which luckily did the right thing with respect
        to OSR exit liveness (it splats a Phantom on its inputs, and it produces a constant result
        which is then set() normally).
        
        This appears to be a broad speed-up, albeit a small one. But mainly it unblocks bug 142229,
        which then should unblock bug 141174.

        to compile.  That's great because CompilationFailed is a well-supported return value on the
        critical path, usually used for when we run out of JIT memory.

        Later, this was moved into DFGCapabilities. This was basically incorrect. It introduced a bug
        where disabling compiling of a CodeBlock meant that we stopped inlining it as well.  So if
        you had a compiler bug that arose if foo was inlined into bar, and you bisected down to bar,
        then foo would no longer get inlined and you wouldn't see the bug.  That's busted.

        So then we changed the code in DFGCapabilities to mark bar as CanCompile and foo as
        CanInline. Now, foo wouldn't get compiled alone but it would get inlined.

        But then we removed CanCompile because that capability mode only existed for the purpose of
        our old varargs hacks.  After that removal, "CanInline" became CannotCompile.  This means
        that if you bisect down on bar in the "foo inlined into bar" case, you'll crash in the DFG
        because the baseline JIT wouldn't have known to insert profiling on foo.

        We could fix this by bringing back CanInline.

        But this is all a pile of nonsense.  The debug support to selectively disable compilation of
        some CodeBlocks shouldn't cross-cut our entire engine and should most certainly never involve
        adding new capability modes.  This support is a hack at best and is for use by JSC hackers
        only.  It should be as unintrusive as possible.

        So, as in the ancient times, the only proper place to put this hack is in DFGDriver.cpp, and
        return CompilationFailed.  This is correct not just because it takes capability modes out of
        the picture (and obviates the need to introduce new ones), but also because it means that
        disabling compilation doesn't change the profiling mode of other CodeBlocks in the Baseline
        JIT.  Capability mode influences profiling mode which in turn influences code generation in
        the Baseline JIT, sometimes in very significant ways - like, we sometimes do additional
        double-to-int conversions in Baseline if we know that we might tier-up into the DFG, since
        this buys us more precise profiling.
        
        This change reduces the intrusiveness of debugging hacks by making them use the very simple
        CompilationFailed mechanism rather than trying to influence capability modes. Capability
        modes have very subtle effects on the whole engine, while CompilationFailed just makes the
        engine pretend like the DFG compilation will happen at timelike infinity. That makes these
        hacks much more likely to continue working as we make other changes to the system.
        
        This brings back the ability to bisect down onto a function bar when bar inlines foo. Prior
        to this change, we would crash in that case.

        Exception stack unwinding in JSC hangs while the Timeline Profiler is enabled.
        <https://webkit.org/b/142191>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Imagine a scenario where the Inspector is paused / suspended at a breakpoint or
        while the user is stepping through JS code. The user then tries to evaluate an
        expression in the console, and that evaluation results in an exception being
        thrown. Currently, if the Timeline Profiler is enabled while this exception is
        being thrown, the WebProcess will hang while trying to handle that exception.

        The issue is that the Timeline Profiler's ProfileGenerator::didExecute() will
        return early and decline to process ProfileNodes if the Inspector is paused.
        This is proper because it does not want to count work done for injected scripts
        (e.g. from the console) towards the timeline profile of the webpage being run.
        However, this is in conflict with ProfileGenerator::exceptionUnwind()'s
        expectation that didExecute() will process ProfileNodes in order to do the stack
        unwinding for the exception handling. As a result,
        ProfileGenerator::exceptionUnwind() hangs.

        ProfileGenerator::exceptionUnwind() is in error. While the Inspector is paused,
        there will not be any ProfileNodes that it needs to "unwind". Hence, the fix is
        simply to return early also in ProfileGenerator::exceptionUnwind() if the
        Inspector is paused.

        [JSC] Use the way number constants are written to help type speculation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142072

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch changes how we interpret numeric constant based on how they appear
        in the source.

        Constants that are integers but written with a decimal point now carry that information
        to the optimizating tiers. From there, we use that to be more aggressive about typing
        math operations toward double operations.

        For example, in:
            var a = x + 1.0;
            var b = y + 1;
        The Add for a would be biased toward doubles, the Add for b would speculate
        integer as usual.


        The gains are tiny but this is a prerequisite to make my next patch useful:
        -SunSpider's access-fannkuch: definitely 1.0661x faster
        -SunSpider's math-cordic: definitely 1.0266x slower
            overal: might be 1.0066x slower.

        Those token types only carry information about how the values were
        entered, an INTEGER does not have to be an integer, it is only written like one.
        Large integer still end up represented as double in memory.

        One trap I fell into was typing numbers like 12e3 as double. This kind of literal
        is frequently used in integer-typed code, while 12.e3 would appear in double-typed
        code.
        Because of that, the only signals for double are: decimal point, negative zero,
        and ridiculously large values.

        MachineThreads::Thread clean up has a use after free race condition.
        <https://webkit.org/b/141990>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        MachineThreads::Thread clean up relies on the clean up mechanism
        implemented in _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key(), which looks like this:

        void _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key(pthread_t self, pthread_key_t key)
        {
            void (*destructor)(void *);
            if (_pthread_key_get_destructor(key, &destructor)) {
                void **ptr = &self->tsd[key];
                void *value = *ptr;

            // === Start of window for the bug to manifest =================

                // At this point, this thread has cached "destructor" and "value"
                // (which is a MachineThreads*).  If the VM gets destructed (along
                // with its MachineThreads registry) by another thread, then this
                // thread will have no way of knowing that the MachineThreads* is
                // now pointing to freed memory.  Calling the destructor below will
                // therefore result in a use after free scenario when it tries to
                // access the MachineThreads' data members.

                if (value) {
                    *ptr = NULL;
                    if (destructor) {

            // === End of window for the bug to manifest ==================

                        destructor(value);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        The fix is to add each active MachineThreads to an ActiveMachineThreadsManager,
        and always check if the manager still contains that MachineThreads object
        before we call removeCurrentThread() on it.  When MachineThreads is destructed,
        it will remove itself from the manager.  The add, remove, and checking
        operations are all synchronized on the manager's lock, thereby ensuring that
        the MachineThreads object, if found in the manager, will remain alive for the
        duration of time we call removeCurrentThread() on it.

        There's also possible for the MachineThreads object to already be destructed
        and another one happened to have been instantiated at the same address.
        Hence, we should only remove the exiting thread if it is found in the
        MachineThreads object.

        There is no test for this issue because this bug requires a race condition
        between 2 threads where:
        1. Thread B, which had previously used the VM, exiting and
           getting to the bug window shown in _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key() above.
        2. Thread A destructing the VM (and its MachineThreads object)
           within that window of time before Thread B calls the destructor.

        It is not possible to get a reliable test case without invasively
        instrumenting _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key() or MachineThreads::removeCurrentThread()
        to significantly increase that window of opportunity.

        DFG SSA stack accesses shouldn't speak of VariableAccessDatas

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        VariableAccessData is a useful thing in LoadStore and ThreadedCPS, but it's purely harmful in
        SSA because you can't cook up new VariableAccessDatas. So, if you know that you want to load
        or store to the stack, and you know what format to use as well as the location, then prior to
        this patch you couldn't do it unless you found some existing VariableAccessData that matched
        your requirements. That can be a hard task.
        
        It's better if SSA doesn't speak of VariableAccessDatas but instead just has stack accesses
        that speak of the things that a stack access needs: local, machineLocal, and format. This
        patch changes the SSA way of accessing the stack to do just that.
        
        Also add more IR validation.

        We will soon (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141174) be in a world where a "world
        clobbering" operation cannot write to our stack, but may be able to read from it. This
        means that we need to change the DFG abstract heap hierarchy to have a notion of Heap that
        subsumes all that World previously subsumed, and a new notion of Stack that is a subtype
        of World and a sibling of Heap.

        So, henceforth "clobbering the world" means reading World and writing Heap.
        
        This makes a bunch of changes to make this work, including changing the implementation of
        disjointness in AbstractHeap to make it support a more general hierarchy. I was expecting

        MachineThreads::Thread clean up has a use after free race condition.
        <https://webkit.org/b/141990>

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        MachineThreads::Thread clean up relies on the clean up mechanism
        implemented in _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key(), which looks like this:

        void _pthread_tsd_cleanup_key(pthread_t self, pthread_key_t key)
        {
            void (*destructor)(void *);
            if (_pthread_key_get_destructor(key, &destructor)) {
                void **ptr = &self->tsd[key];
                void *value = *ptr;

                // At this point, this thread has cached "destructor" and "value"
                // (which is a MachineThreads*).  If the VM gets destructed (along
                // with its MachineThreads registry) by another thread, then this
                // thread will have no way of knowing that the MachineThreads* is
                // now pointing to freed memory.  Calling the destructor below will
                // therefore result in a use after free scenario when it tries to
                // access the MachineThreads' data members.

                if (value) {
                    *ptr = NULL;
                    if (destructor) {
                        destructor(value);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        The solution is simply to change MachineThreads from a per VM thread
        registry to a process global singleton thread registry i.e. the
        MachineThreads registry is now immortal and we cannot have a use after
        free scenario since we never free it.

        The cost of this change is that all VM instances will have to scan
        stacks of all threads ever touched by a VM, and not just those that
        touched a specific VM.  However, stacks tend to be shallow.  Hence,
        those additional scans will tend to be cheap.

        Secondly, it is not common for there to be multiple JSC VMs in use
        concurrently on multiple threads.  Hence, this cost should rarely
        manifest in real world applications.

        Use "this" instead of "callee" to get the constructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141019

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch uses "this" register to pass the constructor (newTarget) to op_create_this from
        op_construct or op_construct_varargs. This will allow future patches that implement ES6 class
        to pass in the most derived class' constructor through "this" argument.

        BytecodeGenerator's emitConstruct and emitConstructVarargs now passes thisRegister like
        regular calls and emitCreateThis passes in this register to op_create_this as constructor.

        The rest of the code change removes the code for special casing "this" register not being used
        in call to construct.

        Constructor returning null should construct an object instead of null
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141640

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        When constructor code doesn't return object, constructor should return `this` object instead.
        Since we used `op_is_object` for this check and `op_is_object` is intended to be used for `typeof`,
        it allows `null` as an object.
        This patch fixes it by introducing an new bytecode `op_is_object_or_null` for `typeof` use cases.
        Instead, constructor uses simplified `is_object`.

        As a result, `op_is_object` becomes fairly simple. So we introduce optimization for `op_is_object`.

        1. LLInt and baseline JIT support `op_is_object` as a fast path.
        2. DFG abstract interpreter support `op_is_object`. And recognize its speculated type and read-write effects.
        3. DFG introduces inlined asm for `op_is_object` rather than calling a C++ function.
        4. FTL lowers DFG's IsObject into LLVM IR.

        And at the same time, this patch fixes isString / isObject predicate used for `op_is_object` and others
        in LLInt, JIT, DFG and FTL.
        Before introducing ES6 Symbol, JSCell is only used for object and string in user observable area.
        So in many places, when the cell is not object, we recognize it as a string, and vice versa.
        However, now ES6 Symbol is implemented as a JSCell, this assumption is broken.
        So this patch stop using !isString as isObject.
        To check whether a cell is an object, instead of seeing that structure ID of a cell is not stringStructure,
        we examine typeInfo in JSCell.

        Constructor returning null should construct an object instead of null
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141640

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        When constructor code doesn't return object, constructor should return `this` object instead.
        Since we used `op_is_object` for this check and `op_is_object` is intended to be used for `typeof`,
        it allows `null` as an object.
        This patch fixes it by introducing an new bytecode `op_is_object_or_null` for `typeof` use cases.
        Instead, constructor uses simplified `is_object`.

        As a result, `op_is_object` becomes fairly simple. So we introduce optimization for `op_is_object`.

        1. LLInt and baseline JIT support `op_is_object` as a fast path.
        2. DFG abstract interpreter support `op_is_object`. And recognize its speculated type and read-write effects.
        3. DFG introduces inlined asm for `op_is_object` rather than calling a C++ function.
        4. FTL lowers DFG's IsObject into LLVM IR.

        And at the same time, this patch fixes isString / isObject predicate used for `op_is_object` and others
        in LLInt, JIT, DFG and FTL.
        Before introducing ES6 Symbol, JSCell is only used for object and string in user observable area.
        So in many places, when the cell is not object, we recognize it as a string, and vice versa.
        However, now ES6 Symbol is implemented as a JSCell, this assumption is broken.
        So this patch stop using !isString as isObject.
        To check whether a cell is an object, instead of seeing that structure ID of a cell is not stringStructure,
        we examine typeInfo in JSCell.

        When window.Symbol is exposed to user-space pages,
        Facebook's JavaScript use it (maybe, for immutable-js and React.js's unique key).
        However, to work with Symbols completely, it also requires
        1) Object.getOwnPropertySymbols (for mixin including Symbols)
        2) the latest ES6 Iterator interface that uses Iterator.next and it returns { done: boolean, value: value }.
        Since they are not landed yet, comments in Facebook don't work.

        This patch introduces RuntimeFlags for JavaScriptCore.
        Specifying SymbolEnabled flag under test runner and inspector to continue to work with Symbol.
        And drop JavaScriptExperimentsEnabled flag
        because it is no longer used and use case of this is duplicated to runtime flags.

        Set the semantic origin of delayed SetLocal to the Bytecode that originated it
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141727

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Previously, delayed SetLocals would have the NodeOrigin of the next
        bytecode. This was because delayed SetLocal are...delayed... and
        currentCodeOrigin() is the one where the node is emitted.

        This made debugging a little awkward since the OSR exits on SetLocal
        were reported for the next bytecode. This patch changes the semantic
        origin to keep the original bytecode.

        From benchmarks, this looks like it could be a tiny bit faster
        but it likely just noise.

        Adjust the ranges of basic block statements in JSC's control flow profiler to be mutually exclusive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141095

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Suppose the control flow of a program forms basic block A with successor block
        B. A's end offset will be the *same* as B's start offset in the current architecture 
        of the control flow profiler. This makes reasoning about the text offsets of
        the control flow profiler unsound. To make reasoning about offsets sound, all 
        basic block ranges should be mutually exclusive.  All calls to emitProfileControlFlow 
        now pass in the *start* of a basic block as the text offset argument. This simplifies 
        all calls to emitProfileControlFlow because the previous implementation had a
        lot of edge cases for getting the desired basic block text boundaries.

        This patch also ensures that the basic block boundary of a block statement 
        is the exactly the block's open and close brace offsets (inclusive). For example,
        in if/for/while statements. This also has the consequence that for statements 
        like "if (cond) foo();", the whitespace preceding "foo()" is not part of 
        the "foo()" basic block, but instead is part of the "if (cond) " basic block. 
        This is okay because these text offsets aren't meant to be human readable.
        Instead, they reflect the text offsets of JSC's AST nodes. The Web Inspector 
        is the only client of this API and user of these text offsets and it is 
        not negatively effected by this new behavior.

        (JSC::CodeBlock::insertBasicBlockBoundariesForControlFlowProfiler):
        When computing basic block boundaries in CodeBlock, we ensure that every

        * bytecompiler/BytecodeGenerator.cpp:
        (JSC::BytecodeGenerator::BytecodeGenerator):
        Because the control flow profiler needs to know which functions

        from before that was hidden because the Type Profiler was always 
        enabled when the control flow profiler was enabled when profiling 
        was turned on from the Web Inspector. But, JSC allows for Control 
        Flow profiling to be turned on without Type Profiling, so we need

        The main effect of this change is that pushing name scopes no longer requires creating symbol
        tables on the fly.
        
        This also makes it so that JSEnvironmentRecords must always have an a priori symbol table.
        
        JSSegmentedVariableObject still does a hack where it creates a blank symbol table on-demand.
        This is needed because that's what JSGlobalObject and all of its many subclasses want. That's
        harmless; I mainly needed a prior symbol tables for JSEnvironmentRecords anyway.

        Function name scope is only created on the function instance that triggered parsing rather than on every function instance that needs it
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141881

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        Previously we only created the function name scope in a way that made it visible to the
        function that triggered parsing/linking of the executable/codeBlock, and to the linker for
        that code block. This was sort of the bare minimum for the feature to appear to work right to
        synthetic tests.

        There are two valid "times" to create the function name scope. Either it's created for each
        JSFunction instance that needs a name scope, or it's created for each execution of such a
        JSFunction. This change chooses the latter, because it happens to be the easiest to implement
        with what we have right now. I opened a bug for optimizing this if we ever need to:

        [JSObjCClassInfo reallocateConstructorAndOrPrototype] should also reallocate super class prototype chain.
        <https://webkit.org/b/141809>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        A ObjC class that implement the JSExport protocol will have a JS prototype
        chain and constructor automatically synthesized for its JS wrapper object.
        However, if there are no more instances of that ObjC class reachable by a
        JS GC root scan, then its synthesized prototype chain and constructors may
        be released by the GC.  If a new instance of that ObjC class is subsequently
        instantiated, then [JSObjCClassInfo reallocateConstructorAndOrPrototype]
        should re-construct the prototype chain and constructor (if they were
        previously released).  However, the current implementation only
        re-constructs the immediate prototype, but not every other prototype
        object upstream in the prototype chain.

        To fix this, we do the following:
        1. We no longer allocate the JSObjCClassInfo's prototype and constructor
           eagerly.  Hence, -initWithContext:forClass: will no longer call
           -allocateConstructorAndPrototypeWithSuperClassInfo:.
        2. Instead, we'll always access the prototype and constructor thru
           accessor methods.  The accessor methods will call
           -allocateConstructorAndPrototype: if needed.
        3. -allocateConstructorAndPrototype: will fetch the needed superClassInfo
           from the JSWrapperMap itself.  This makes it so that we no longer
           need to pass the superClassInfo all over.
        4. -allocateConstructorAndPrototype: will get the super class prototype
           by invoking -prototype: on the superClassInfo, thereby allowing the
           super class to allocate its prototype and constructor if needed and
           fixing the issue in this bug.

        5. Also removed the GC warning comments, and ensured that needed JS
           objects are kept alive by having a local var pointing to it from the
           stack (which makes a GC root).

        DFG should really support varargs

        This adds comprehensive vararg call support to the DFG and FTL compilers. Previously, if a
        function had a varargs call, then it could only be compiled if that varargs call was just
        forwarding arguments and we were inlining the function rather than compiling it directly. Also,
        only varargs calls were dealt with; varargs constructs were not.
        
        This lifts all of those restrictions. Every varargs call or construct can now be compiled by both
        the DFG and the FTL. Those calls can also be inlined, too - provided that profiling gives us a
        sensible bound on arguments list length. When we inline a varargs call, the act of loading the
        varargs is now made explicit in IR. I believe that we have enough IR machinery in place that we
        would be able to do the arguments forwarding optimization as an IR transformation. This patch
        doesn't implement that yet, and keeps the old bytecode-based varargs argument forwarding
        optimization for now.
        
        There are three major IR features introduced in this patch:
        
        CallVarargs/ConstructVarargs: these are like Call/Construct except that they take an arguments
        array rather than a list of arguments. Currently, they splat this arguments array onto the stack
        using the same basic technique as the baseline JIT has always done. Except, these nodes indicate
        that we are not interested in doing the non-escaping "arguments" optimization.
        
        CallForwardVarargs: this is a form of CallVarargs that just does the non-escaping "arguments"
        optimization, aka forwarding arguments. It's somewhat lazy that this doesn't include
        ConstructForwardVarargs, but the reason is that once we eliminate the lazy tear-off for
        arguments, this whole thing will have to be tweaked - and for now forwarding on construct is just
        not important in benchmarks. ConstructVarargs will still do forwarding, just not inlined.
        
        LoadVarargs: loads all elements out of an array onto the stack in a manner suitable for a varargs
        call. This is used only when a varargs call (or construct) was inlined. The bytecode parser will
        make room on the stack for the arguments, and will use LoadVarars to put those arguments into
        place.
        
        In the future, we can consider adding strength reductions like:
        
        - If CallVarargs/ConstructVarargs see an array of known size with known elements, turn them into
          Call/Construct.
        
        - If CallVarargs/ConstructVarargs are passed an unmodified, unescaped Arguments object, then
          turn them into CallForwardVarargs/ConstructForwardVarargs.
        
        - If LoadVarargs sees an array of known size, then turn it into a sequence of GetByVals and
          PutLocals.
        
        - If LoadVarargs sees an unmodified, unescaped Arguments object, then turn it into something like
          LoadForwardVarargs.
        
        - If CallVarargs/ConstructVarargs/LoadVarargs see the result of a splice (or other Array
          prototype function), then do the splice and varargs loading in one go (maybe via a new node
          type).

        I broke C-Loop when moving the common code of pow()
        to JITOperations because that file is #ifdefed out
        when the JITs are disabled.

        It would be weird to move it back to MathObject since
        the function needs to know about the calling conventions.

        To avoid making a mess, I just gave the function its own file
        that is used by both the runtime and the JIT.

        Added a new failure handler, loweringFailed(), to LowerDFGToLLVM that reports failures
        while processing DFG lowering.  For debug builds, the failures are logged identical

        and that FTL compilation is terminated, but the process is allowed to continue.
        Wrapped calls to loweringFailed() in a macro LOWERING_FAILED so the function and
        line number are reported at the point of the inconsistancy.

        DFG SSA should use GetLocal for arguments, and the GetArgument node type should be removed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141623

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.
        
        During development of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141332, I realized that I
        needed to use GetArgument for loading something that has magically already appeared on the
        stack, so currently trunk sort of allows this. But then I realized three things:
        
        - A GetArgument with a non-JSValue flush format means speculating that the value on the
          stack obeys that format, rather than just assuming that that it already has that format.
          In bug 141332, I want it to assume rather than speculate. That also happens to be more
          intuitive; I don't think I was wrong to expect that.
        
        - The node I really want is GetLocal. I'm just getting the value of the local and I don't
          want to do anything else.
        
        - Maybe it would be easier if we just used GetLocal for all of the cases where we currently
          use GetArgument.
        
        This changes the FTL to do argument speculations in the prologue just like the DFG does.
        This brings some consistency to our system, and allows us to get rid of the GetArgument
        node. The speculations that the FTL must do are now made explicit in the m_argumentFormats
        vector in DFG::Graph. This has natural DCE behavior: even if all uses of the argument are
        dead we will still speculate. We already have safeguards to ensure we only speculate if
        there are uses that benefit from speculation (which is a much more conservative criterion
        than DCE).

        This simple adjustment appears to be a 2% speed-up on Octane. Over time, the slow case
        heuristic has essentially stopped working because the typical execution count threshold for a
        bytecode instruction is around 66 while the slow case threshold is 100: virtually
        guaranteeing that the DFG will never think that a bytecode instruction has taken the slow
        case even if it took it every single time. So, this changes the slow case threshold to 20.
        
        I checked if we could lower this down further, like to 10. That is worse than 20, and about
        as bad as 100.

        is really no such thing as an inlineStackOffset except when we OSR exit; while the code is

        Due to CFA analysis, the CompareStrictEq node was determined to be unreachable, but later
        was determined to be reachable.  When we go to lower to LLVM, the edges for the CompareStrictEq

        lowering can still be handled by the FTL.

        Had to add GetArgument as a node that the FTL can compile as the SSA conversion phase converts
        a SetArgument to a GetArgument.  Before this change FTL::canCompile() would never see a GetArgument
        node.  With the check right before lowering, we see this node.

        Not only was this not used, I believe that the math was wrong. The callee frame doesn't
        actually land past m_nextMachineLocal; instead it lands just below wherever we put SP and
        that decision is made elsewhere. Also, it makes no sense to subtract 1 from

        DFG::StackLayoutPhase should always set the scopeRegister to VirtualRegister() because the DFG doesn't do anything to make its value valid
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141412

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        StackLayoutPhase was attempting to ensure that the register that
        CodeBlock::scopeRegister() points to is the right one for the DFG. But the DFG did nothing
        else to maintain the validity of the scopeRegister(). It wasn't captured as far as I can
        tell. StackLayoutPhase didn't explicitly mark it live. PreciseLocalClobberize didn't mark
        it as being live. So, by the time we got here the register referred to by
        CodeBlock::scopeRegister() would have been junk. Moreover, CodeBlock::scopeRegister() was
        not used for DFG code blocks, and was hardly ever used outside of bytecode generation.
        
        So, this patch just removes the code to manipulate this field and replaces it with an
        unconditional setScopeRegister(VirtualRegister()). Setting it to the invalid register
        ensures that any attempst to read the scopeRegister in a DFG or FTL frame immediately
        punts.

        Varargs frame set-up should be factored out for use by other JITs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141388

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        Previously the code that dealt with varargs always assumed that we were setting up a varargs call
        frame by literally following the execution semantics of op_call_varargs. This isn't how it'll
        happen once the DFG and FTL do varargs calls, or when varargs calls get inlined. The DFG and FTL
        don't literally execute bytecode; for example their stack frame layout has absolutely nothing in
        common with what the bytecode says, and that will never change.
        
        This patch makes two changes:
        
        Setting up the varargs callee frame can be done in smaller steps: particularly in the case of a
        varargs call that gets inlined, we aren't going to actually want to set up a callee frame in
        full - we just want to put the arguments somewhere, and that place will not have much (if
        anything) in common with the call frame format. This patch factors that out into something called
        a loadVarargs. The thing we used to call loadVarargs is now called setupVarargsFrame. This patch
        also separates loading varargs from setting this, since the fact that those two things are done
        together is a detail made explicit in bytecode but it's not at all required in the higher-tier
        engines. In the process of factoring this code out, I found a bunch of off-by-one errors in the
        various calculations. I fixed them. The distance from the caller's frame pointer to the callee
        frame pointer is always:
        
            numUsedCallerSlots + argCount + 1 + CallFrameSize
        
        where numUsedCallerSlots is toLocal(firstFreeRegister) - 1, which simplifies down to just
        -firstFreeRegister. The code now speaks of numUsedCallerSlots rather than firstFreeRegister,
        since the latter is a bytecode peculiarity that doesn't apply in the DFG or FTL. In the DFG, the
        internally-computed frame size, minus the parameter slots, will be used for numUsedCallerSlots.
        In the FTL, we will essentially compute numUsedCallerSlots dynamically by subtracting SP from FP.
        Eventually, LLVM might give us some cleaner way of doing this, but it probably doesn't matter
        very much.
        
        The arguments forwarding optimization is factored out of the Baseline JIT: the DFG and FTL will
        want to do this optimization as well, but it involves quite a bit of code. So, this code is now
        factored out into SetupVarargsFrame.h|cpp, so that other JITs can use it. In the process of factoring
        this code out I noticed that the 32-bit and 64-bit code is nearly identical, so I combined them.

        DFG should only have two mechanisms for describing effectfulness of nodes; previously there were three

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        We previously used the NodeMightClobber and NodeClobbersWorld NodeFlags to describe
        effectfulness.  Starting over a year ago, we introduced a more powerful mechanism - the
        DFG::clobberize() function.  Now we only have one remaining client of the old NodeFlags,
        and everyone else uses DFG::clobberize().  We should get rid of those NodeFlags and
        finally switch everyone over to DFG::clobberize().
        
        Unfortunately there is still another place where effectfulness of nodes is described: the
        AbstractInterpreter. This is because the AbstractInterpreter has special tuning both for
        compile time performance and there are places where the AI is more precise than
        clobberize() because of its flow-sensitivity.
        
        This means that after this change there will be only two places, rather than three, where

        The VM's MachineThreads registry object is being referenced from other

        holding a reference to the registry and will eventually invoke
        removeThread() on it on thread exit.  Hence, there's a possible use
        after free scenario here.

        The fix is to make MachineThreads ThreadSafeRefCounted, and have all
        threads that references keep a RefPtr to it to ensure that it stays

        Remove BytecodeGenerator::preserveLastVar() and replace it with a more robust mechanism for preserving non-temporary registers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141211

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Previously, the way non-temporary registers were preserved (i.e. not reclaimed anytime
        we did newTemporary()) by calling preserveLastVar() after all non-temps are created. It
        would raise the refcount on the last (highest-numbered) variable created, and rely on
        the fact that register reclamation started at higher-numbered registers and worked its
        way down. So any retained register would block any lower-numbered registers from being
        reclaimed.
        
        Also, preserveLastVar() sets a thing called m_firstConstantIndex. It's unused.
        
        This removes preserveLastVar() and makes addVar() retain each register it creates. This
        is more explicit, since addVar() is the mechanism for creating non-temporary registers.
        
        To make this work I had to remove an assertion that Register::setIndex() can only be
        called when the refcount is zero. This method might be called after a var is created to
        change its index. This previously worked because preserveLastVar() would be called after
        we had already made all index changes, so the vars would still have refcount zero. Now
        they have refcount 1. I think it's OK to lose this assertion; I can't remember this
        assertion ever firing in a way that alerted me to a serious issue.

        have exactly the same source and enter CodeCache::getGlobalCodeBlock() itself.  When it
        looks up the code block, it sees it as a cache it and uses the nullptr UnlinkedCodeBlockType*
        and crashes.  This fixes the problem by not dropping the locks during garbage collection.
        There are other likely scenarios where we have a data structure like this code cache in an
        unsafe state for arbitrary reentrance.

        Moved the functionality of DelayedReleaseScope directly into Heap.  Changed it into
        a simple list that is cleared with the new function Heap::releaseDelayedReleasedObjects.
        Now we accumulate objects to be released and release them when all locks are dropped or
        when destroying the Heap.  This eliminated the dropping and reaquiring of locks associated
        with the old scope form of this list.

        Given that all functionality of DelayedReleaseScope is now used and referenced by Heap
        and the lock management no longer needs to be done, just made the list a member of Heap.
        We do need to guard against the case that releasing an object can create more objects
        by calling into JS.  That is why releaseDelayedReleasedObjects() is written to remove
        an object to release so that we aren't recursively in Vector code.  The other thing we
        do in releaseDelayedReleasedObjects() is to guard against recursive calls to itself using
        the m_delayedReleaseRecursionCount.  We only release at the first entry into the function.
        This case is already tested by testapi.mm.

        Remove concept of makeUsableFromMultipleThreads().
        <https://webkit.org/b/141221>

        Reviewed by Mark Hahnenberg.

        Currently, we rely on VM::makeUsableFromMultipleThreads() being called before we
        start acquiring the JSLock and entering the VM from different threads.
        Acquisition of the JSLock will register the acquiring thread with the VM's thread
        registry if not already registered.  However, it will only do this if the VM's
        thread specific key has been initialized by makeUsableFromMultipleThreads().

        This is fragile, and also does not read intuitively because one would expect to
        acquire the JSLock before calling any methods on the VM.  This is exactly what
        JSGlobalContextCreateInGroup() did (i.e. acquire the lock before calling
        makeUsableFromMultipleThreads()), but is wrong.  The result is that the invoking
        thread will not have been registered with the VM during that first entry into
        the VM.

        The fix is to make it so that we initialize the VM's thread specific key on
        construction of the VM's MachineThreads registry instead of relying on
        makeUsableFromMultipleThreads() being called.  With this, we can eliminate
        makeUsableFromMultipleThreads() altogether.

        Performance results are neutral in aggregate.

        There's a bug where thread destructors may not get called.  As far as
        we know, this only manifests on darwin ports.  We will work around this
        by checking at GC time if the platform thread is still valid.  If not,
        we'll purge it from the VM's registeredThreads list before proceeding
        with thread scanning activity.

        Note: it is important that we do this invalid thread detection during
        suspension, because the validity (and liveness) of the other thread is
        only guaranteed while it is suspended.

        arguments[-1] should have well-defined behavior

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.
        
        According to JSC's internal argument numbering, 0 is "this" and 1 is the first argument.
        In the "arguments[i]" expression, "this" is not accessible and i = 0 refers to the first
        argument. Previously we handled the bounds check in "arguments[i]" - where "arguments" is
        statically known to be the current function's arguments object - as follows:
        
            add 1, i
            branchAboveOrEqual i, callFrame.ArgumentCount, slowPath
        
        The problem with this is that if i = -1, this passes the test, and we end up accessing
        what would be the "this" argument slot. That's wrong, since we should really be bottoming
        out in arguments["-1"], which is usually undefined but could be anything. It's even worse
        if the function is inlined or if we're in a constructor - in that case the "this" slot
        could be garbage.
        
        It turns out that we had this bug in all of our engines.
        
        This fixes the issue by changing the algorithm to:
        
            load32 callFrame.ArgumentCount, tmp
            sub 1, tmp
            branchAboveOrEqual i, tmp, slowPath
        
        In some engines, we would have used the modified "i" (the one that had 1 added to it) for
        the subsequent argument load; since we don't do this anymore I also had to change some of
        the offsets on the BaseIndex arguments load.
        
        This also includes tests that are written in such a way as to get coverage on LLInt and
        Baseline JIT (get-my-argument-by-val-wrap-around-no-warm-up), DFG and FTL

        overwriting the "arguments" variable (get-my-argument-by-val-safe-wrap-around). This also
        includes off-by-1 out-of-bounds tests for each of these cases, since in the process of
        writing the patch I broke the arguments[arguments.length] case in the DFG and didn't see
        any test failures.

        BinarySwitch should be faster on average
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141046

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.
        
        This optimizes our binary switch using math. It's strictly better than what we had before
        assuming we bottom out in some case (rather than fall through), assuming all cases get
        hit with equal probability. The difference is particularly large for large switch
        statements. For example, a switch statement with 1000 cases would previously require on
        average 13.207 branches to get to some case, while now it just requires 10.464.
        
        This is also a progression for the fall-through case, though we could shave off another
        1/6 branch on average if we wanted to - though it would regress taking a case (not falling
        through) by 1/6 branch. I believe it's better to bias the BinarySwitch for not falling
        through.
        
        This also adds some randomness to the algorithm to minimize the likelihood of us
        generating a switch statement that is always particularly bad for some input. Note that
        the randomness has no effect on average-case performance assuming all cases are equally
        likely.
        
        This ought to have no actual performance change because we don't rely on binary switches
        that much. The main reason why this change is interesting is that I'm finding myself
        increasingly relying on BinarySwitch, and I'd like to know that it's optimal.

        Create tests for JSC's Control Flow Profiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141123

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch creates a control flow profiler testing API in jsc.cpp 
        that accepts a function and a string as arguments. The string must 
        be a substring of the text of the function argument. The API returns 
        a boolean indicating whether or not the basic block that encloses the 
        substring has executed.

        This patch uses this API to test that the control flow profiler
        behaves as expected on basic block boundaries. These tests do not
        provide full coverage for all JavaScript statements that can create
        basic blocks boundaries. Full coverage will come in a later patch.

        Polymorphic call inlining should be based on polymorphic call inline caching rather than logging
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140660

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        When we first implemented polymorphic call inlining, we did the profiling based on a call
        edge log. The idea was to store each call edge (a tuple of call site and callee) into a
        global log that was processed lazily. Processing the log would give precise counts of call
        edges, and could be used to drive well-informed inlining decisions - polymorphic or not.
        This was a speed-up on throughput tests but a slow-down for latency tests. It was a net win
        nonetheless.
        
        Experience with this code shows three things. First, the call edge profiler is buggy and
        complex. It would take work to fix the bugs. Second, the call edge profiler incurs lots of
        overhead for latency code that we care deeply about. Third, it's not at all clear that
        having call edge counts for every possible callee is any better than just having call edge
        counts for the limited number of callees that an inline cache would catch.
        
        So, this patch removes the call edge profiler and replaces it with a polymorphic call inline
        cache. If we miss the basic call inline cache, we inflate the cache to be a jump to an
        out-of-line stub that cases on the previously known callees. If that misses again, then we
        rewrite that stub to include the new callee. We do this up to some number of callees. If we
        hit the limit then we switch to using a plain virtual call.
        
        Substantial speed-up on V8Spider; undoes the slow-down that the original call edge profiler
        caused. Might be a SunSpider speed-up (below 1%), depending on hardware.

        Implement ES6 Symbol
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140435

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch implements ES6 Symbol. In this patch, we don't support
        Symbol.keyFor, Symbol.for, Object.getOwnPropertySymbols. They will be
        supported in the subsequent patches.

        Since ES6 Symbol is introduced as new primitive value, we implement
        Symbol as a derived class from JSCell. And now JSValue accepts Symbol*
        as a new primitive value.

        Symbol has a *unique* flagged StringImpl* as an `uid`. Which pointer
        value represents the Symbol's identity. So don't compare Symbol's
        JSCell pointer value for comparison.
        This enables re-producing Symbol primitive value from StringImpl* uid
        by executing`Symbol::create(vm, uid)`. This is needed to produce
        Symbol primitive values from stored StringImpl* in `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`.

        And Symbol.[[Description]] is folded into the string value of Symbol's uid.
        By doing so, we can represent ES6 Symbol without extending current PropertyTable key; StringImpl*.

        Implement ES6 class syntax without inheritance support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140918

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Added the most basic support for ES6 class syntax. After this patch, we support basic class definition like:
        class A {
            constructor() { }
            someMethod() { }
        }

        We'll add the support for "extends" keyword and automatically generating a constructor in follow up patches.
        We also don't support block scoping of a class declaration.

        We support both class declaration and class expression. A class expression is implemented by the newly added
        ClassExprNode AST node. A class declaration is implemented by ClassDeclNode, which is a thin wrapper around
        AssignResolveNode.

        Polymorphic call inlining should be based on polymorphic call inline caching rather than logging
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140660

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        When we first implemented polymorphic call inlining, we did the profiling based on a call
        edge log. The idea was to store each call edge (a tuple of call site and callee) into a
        global log that was processed lazily. Processing the log would give precise counts of call
        edges, and could be used to drive well-informed inlining decisions - polymorphic or not.
        This was a speed-up on throughput tests but a slow-down for latency tests. It was a net win
        nonetheless.
        
        Experience with this code shows three things. First, the call edge profiler is buggy and
        complex. It would take work to fix the bugs. Second, the call edge profiler incurs lots of
        overhead for latency code that we care deeply about. Third, it's not at all clear that
        having call edge counts for every possible callee is any better than just having call edge
        counts for the limited number of callees that an inline cache would catch.
        
        So, this patch removes the call edge profiler and replaces it with a polymorphic call inline
        cache. If we miss the basic call inline cache, we inflate the cache to be a jump to an
        out-of-line stub that cases on the previously known callees. If that misses again, then we
        rewrite that stub to include the new callee. We do this up to some number of callees. If we
        hit the limit then we switch to using a plain virtual call.
        
        Substantial speed-up on V8Spider; undoes the slow-down that the original call edge profiler
        caused. Might be a SunSpider speed-up (below 1%), depending on hardware.

        Web Inspector: ES6: Improved Console Format for Set and Map Objects (like Arrays)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122867

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add new Runtime.RemoteObject object subtypes for "map", "set", and "weakmap".

        Upgrade Runtime.ObjectPreview to include type/subtype information. Now,
        an ObjectPreview can be used for any value, in place of a RemoteObject,
        and not capture / hold a reference to the value. The value will be in
        the string description.

        Adding this information to ObjectPreview can duplicate some information
        in the protocol messages if a preview is provided, but simplifies
        previews, so that all the information you need for any RemoteObject
        preview is available. To slim messages further, make "overflow" and
        "properties" only available on previews that may contain properties.
        So, not primitives or null.

        Finally, for "Map/Set/WeakMap" add an "entries" list to the preview
        that will return previews with "key" and "value" properties depending
        on the collection type. To get live, non-preview objects from a
        collection, use Runtime.getCollectionEntries.

        In order to keep the WeakMap's values Weak the frontend may provide
        a unique object group name when getting collection entries. It may
        then release that object group, e.g. when not showing the WeakMap's
        values to the user, and thus remove the strong reference to the keys
        so they may be garbage collected.

        (JSC::WeakMapData::begin):

        * inspector/scripts/codegen/generator.py:
        Add another type with runtime casting.

        * inspector/InjectedScriptSource.js:
        - Implement getCollectionEntries to get a range of values from a
        collection. The non-Weak collections have an order to their keys (in
        order of added) so range'd gets are okay. WeakMap does not have an
        order, so only allow fetching a number of values.
        - Update preview generation to address the Runtime.ObjectPreview
        type changes.

        Copy non-current thread stacks before scanning them instead of scanning
        them in-place.

        This operation is uncommon (i.e., never in the web content process),
        and even in a stress test with 4 threads it only copies about 27kB,
        so I think the performance cost is OK.

        Scanning in-place requires a complex dance where we constrain our GC
        data structures not to use malloc, free, or any other interesting functions
        that might acquire locks. We've gotten this wrong many times in the past,
        and I just got it wrong again yesterday. Since this code path is rarely
        tested, I want it to just make sense, and not depend on or constrain the
        details of the rest of the GC heap's design.

        you do one pass over all the threads to compute their combined size,
        and then a second pass to do all the copying. In theory, the threads may
        grow in between passes, in which case you'll continue until the threads
        stop growing. In practice, you never continue.

        Web Inspector: Object Previews in the Console
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129204

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Update the very old, unused object preview code. Part of this comes from
        the earlier WebKit legacy implementation, and the Blink implementation.

        A RemoteObject may include a preview, if it is asked for, and if the
        RemoteObject is an object. Previews are a shallow (single level) list
        of a limited number of properties on the object. The previewed
        properties are always stringified (even if primatives). Previews are
        limited to just 5 properties or 100 indices. Previews are marked
        as lossless if they are a complete snapshot of the object.

        There is a path to make previews two levels deep, that is currently
        unused but should soon be used for tables (e.g. IndexedDB).

        * inspector/InjectedScriptSource.js:
        - Move some code off of InjectedScript to be generic functions
        usable by RemoteObject as well.
        - Update preview generation to use 

        * inspector/protocol/Runtime.json:
        - Add a new type, "accessor" for preview objects. This represents
        a getter / setter. We currently don't get the value.

        BytecodeGenerator::initializeCapturedVariable() sets a misleading value for the 5th operand of op_put_to_scope.
        <https://webkit.org/b/140743>

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        BytecodeGenerator::initializeCapturedVariable() was setting the 5th operand to
        op_put_to_scope to an inappropriate value (i.e. 0).  As a result, the execution
        of put_to_scope could store a wrong inferred value into the VariableWatchpointSet
        for which ever captured variable is at local index 0.  In practice, this turns
        out to be the local for the Arguments object.  In this reproduction case in the
        bug, the wrong inferred value written there is the boolean true.

        Subsequently, DFG compilation occurs and CreateArguments is emitted to first do
        a check of the local for the Arguments object.  But because that local has a
        wrong inferred value, the check always discovers a non-null value and we never
        actually create the Arguments object.  Immediately after this, an OSR exit
        occurs leaving the Arguments object local uninitialized.  Later on at arguments
        tear off, we run into a boolean true where we had expected to find an Arguments
        object, which in turn, leads to the crash.

        The fix is to:
        1. In the case where the resolveModeType is LocalClosureVar, change the
           5th operand of op_put_to_scope to be a boolean.  True means that the
           local var is watchable.  False means it is not watchable.  We no longer
           pass the local index (instead of true) and UINT_MAX (instead of false).

           This allows us to express more clearer in the code what that value means,
           as well as remove the redundant way of getting the local's identifier.
           The identifier is always the one passed in the 2nd operand. 

        2. Previously, though intuitively, we know that the watchable variable
           identifier should be the same as the one that is passed in operand 2, this
           relationship was not clear in the code.  By code analysis, I confirmed that 
           the callers of BytecodeGenerator::emitPutToScope() always use the same
           identifier for operand 2 and for filling out the ResolveScopeInfo from
           which we get the watchable variable identifier later.  I've changed the
           code to make this clear now by always using the identifier passed in
           operand 2.

        3. In the case where the resolveModeType is LocalClosureVar,
           initializeCapturedVariable() and emitPutToScope() will now query
           hasWatchableVariable() to determine if the local is watchable or not.
           Accordingly, we pass the boolean result of hasWatchableVariable() as
           operand 5 of op_put_to_scope.

        Also added some assertions.

        In the put_by_val_direct operation, we use JSObject::putDirect.
        However, it only accepts non-index property. For index property, we need to use JSObject::putDirectIndex.
        This patch changes Identifier::asIndex() to return Optional<uint32_t>.
        It forces callers to check the value is index or not explicitly.
        Additionally, it checks toString-ed Identifier is index or not to choose putDirect / putDirectIndex.

        In the put_by_val_direct operation, we use JSObject::putDirect.
        However, it only accepts non-index property. For index property, we need to use JSObject::putDirectIndex.
        This patch changes Identifier::asIndex() to return Optional<uint32_t>.
        It forces callers to check the value is index or not explicitly.
        Additionally, it checks toString-ed Identifier is index or not to choose putDirect / putDirectIndex.

        Web Replay: code generator should take supplemental specifications and allow cross-framework references
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136312

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Some types are shared between replay inputs from different frameworks.
        Previously, these type declarations were duplicated in every input
        specification file in which they were used. This caused some type encoding
        traits to be emitted twice if used from WebCore inputs and WebKit2 inputs.

        This patch teaches the replay inputs code generator to accept multiple
        input specification files. Inputs can freely reference types from other
        frameworks without duplicating declarations.

        On the code generation side, the model could contain types and inputs from
        frameworks that are not the target framework. Only generate code for the
        target framework.

        To properly generate cross-framework type encoding traits, use
        Type.encoding_type_argument in more places, and add the export macro for WebCore
        and the Test framework.

        Adjust some tests so that enum coverage is preserved by moving the enum types
        into "Test" (the target framework for tests).

        ClosureCallStubRoutine no longer needs codeOrigin
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140659

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.
        
        Once upon a time, we would look for the CodeOrigin associated with a return PC. This search
        would start with the CodeBlock according to the caller frame's call frame header. But if the
        call was a closure call, the return PC would be inside some closure call stub. So if the
        CodeBlock search failed, we would search *all* closure call stub routines to see which one
        encompasses the return PC. Then, we would use the CodeOrigin stored in the stub routine
        object. This was all a bunch of madness, and we actually got rid of it - we now determine
        the CodeOrigin for a call frame using the encoded code origin bits inside the tag of the
        argument count.
        
        This patch removes the final vestiges of the madness:
        
        - Remove the totally unused method declaration for the thing that did the closure call stub
          search.
        
        - Remove the CodeOrigin field from the ClosureCallStubRoutine. Except for that crazy search
          that we no longer do, everyone else who finds a ClosureCallStubRoutine will find it via
          the CallLinkInfo. The CallLinkInfo also has the CodeOrigin, so we don't need this field
          anymore.

        Basic block start offsets should never be larger than end offsets in the control flow profiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140377

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        The bytecode generator will emit code more than once for some AST nodes. For instance, 
        the finally block of TryNode will emit two code paths for its finally block: one for 
        the normal path, and another for the path where an exception is thrown in the catch block. 
        
        This repeated code emission of the same AST node previously broke how the control 
        flow profiler computed text ranges of basic blocks because when the same AST node 
        is emitted multiple times, there is a good chance that there are ranges that span 
        from the end offset of one of these duplicated nodes back to the start offset of 
        the same duplicated node. This caused a basic block range to report a larger start 
        offset than end offset. This was incorrect. Now, when this situation is encountered 
        while linking a CodeBlock, the faulty range in question is ignored.

        DFG can call PutByValDirect for generic arrays
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140389

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Computed properties in object initializers (ES6) use the put_by_val_direct operation.
        However, current DFG asserts that put_by_val_direct is not used for the generic array,
        the assertion failure is raised.
        This patch allow DFG to use put_by_val_direct to generic arrays.

        And fix the DFG put_by_val_direct implementation for string properties.
        At first, put_by_val_direct is inteded to be used for spread elements.
        So the property keys were limited to numbers (indexes).
        But now, it's also used for computed properties in object initializers.

        Local JSArray* "keys" in objectConstructorKeys() is not marked during garbage collection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140348

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        We used to read registers in MachineThreads::gatherFromCurrentThread(), but that is too late
        because those registers may have been spilled on the stack and replaced with other values by
        the time we call down to gatherFromCurrentThread().

        Now we get the register contents at the same place that we demarcate the current top of
        stack using the address of a local variable, in Heap::markRoots().  The register contents
        buffer is passed along with the demarcation pointer.  These need to be done at this level 
        in the call tree and no lower, as markRoots() calls various functions that visit object
        pointers that may be latter proven dead.  Any of those pointers that are left on the
        stack or in registers could be incorrectly marked as live if we scan the stack contents
        from a called function or one of its callees.  The stack demarcation pointer and register
        saving need to be done in the same function so that we have a consistent stack, active
        and spilled registers.

        Because we don't want to make unnecessary calls to get the register contents, we use
        a macro to allocated, and possibly align, the register structure and get the actual
        register contents.

        When parsing a single line cached function, use the lineStartOffset of the
        location where we found the cached function instead of the cached lineStartOffset.
        The cache location's lineStartOffset has not been adjusted for any possible
        containing functions.

        This change is not needed for multi-line cached functions.  Consider the
        single line source:

        function outer(){function inner1(){doStuff();}; (function inner2() {doMoreStuff()})()}

        The first parser pass, we parse and cache inner1() and inner2() with a lineStartOffset
        of 0.  Later when we parse outer() and find inner1() in the cache, SourceCode start
        character is at outer()'s outermost open brace.  That is what we should use for
        lineStartOffset for inner1().  When done parsing inner1() we set the parsing token
        to the saved location for inner1(), including the lineStartOffset of 0.  We need
        to use the value of lineStartOffset before we started parsing inner1().  That is
        what the fix does.  When we parse inner2() the lineStartOffset will be correct.

        For a multi-line function, the close brace is guaranteed to be on a different line
        than the open brace.  Hence, its lineStartOffset will not change with the change of
        the SourceCode start character

        Argument object created by "Function dot arguments" should use a clone of the argument values.
        <https://webkit.org/b/140093>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        After the change in <https://webkit.org/b/139827>, the dfg-tear-off-arguments-not-activation.js
        test will crash.  The relevant code which manifests the issue is as follows:

            function bar() {
                return foo.arguments;
            }

            function foo(p) {
                var x = 42;
                if (p)
                    return (function() { return x; });
                else
                    return bar();
            }

        In this case, foo() has no knowledge of bar() needing its LexicalEnvironment and
        has dead code eliminated the SetLocal that stores it into its designated local.
        In bar(), the factory for the Arguments object (for creating foo.arguments) tries
        to read foo's LexicalEnvironment from its designated lexicalEnvironment local,
        but instead, finds it to be uninitialized.  This results in a null pointer access
        which causes a crash.

        This can be resolved by having bar() instantiate a clone of the Arguments object
        instead, and populate its elements with values fetched directly from foo's frame.
        There's no need to reference foo's LexicalEnvironment (whether present or not).

        Web Inspector: purge PassRefPtr from Inspector code and use Ref for typed and untyped protocol objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140053

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch replaces uses of PassRefPtr with uses of RefPtr&& and WTF::move() in code
        related to Web Inspector. It also converts many uses of RefPtr to Ref where
        references are always non-null. These two refactorings have been combined since
        they tend to require similar changes to the code.

        Creation methods for subclasses of InspectorValue now return a Ref, and callsites
        have been updated to take a Ref instead of RefPtr.

        Builders for typed protocol objects now return a Ref. Since there is no implicit
        call to operator&, callsites now must explicitly call .release() to convert a
        builder object into the corresponding protocol object once required fields are set.
        Update callsites and use auto to eliminate repetition of longwinded protocol types.

        Tests for inspector protocol and replay inputs have been rebaselined.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Removed CallFrame::scope() and CallFrame::setScope() and eliminated or changed
        all usages of these funcitons.  In some cases the scope is passed in or determined
        another way.  In some cases the scope is used to calculate other values.  Lastly
        were places where these functions where used that are no longer needed.  For
        example when making a call, the caller's ScopeChain was copied to the callee's
        ScopeChain.  This change no longer uses the ScopeChain call frame header slot.
        That slot will be removed in a future patch.

        JavaScript Control Flow Profiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137785

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch introduces a mechanism for JavaScriptCore to profile
        which basic blocks have executed. This mechanism will then be
        used by the Web Inspector to indicate which basic blocks
        have and have not executed.
        
        The profiling works by compiling in an op_profile_control_flow
        at the start of every basic block. Then, whenever this op code 
        executes, we know that a particular basic block has executed.
        
        When we tier up a CodeBlock that contains an op_profile_control_flow
        that corresponds to an already executed basic block, we don't
        have to emit code for that particular op_profile_control_flow
        because the internal data structures used to keep track of 
        basic block locations has already recorded that the corresponding
        op_profile_control_flow has executed.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The StringImpl* -> Weak<JSString> cache used by the DOM bindings
        had a bug where the key could become a stale pointer if the cached
        JSString had its internal StringImpl atomicized.

        If a new StringImpl was then later constructed at the exact same
        address as the stale key, before the Weak<JSString> got booted out
        of the string cache, we'd now have a situation where asking the
        string cache for that key would return the old JSString.

        Solve this by not allowing JSString::toExistingAtomicString() to
        change the JSString's internal StringImpl unless it's resolving a
        rope string. (The StringImpl nullity determines rope state.)

        This means that calling toExistingAtomicString() may now have to
        query the AtomicString table on each call rather than just once.
        All clients of this API would be forced to do this regardless,
        since they return value will be used to key into containers with
        AtomicStringImpl* keys.

        No test because this relies on malloc putting two StringImpls
        at the same address at different points in time and we have no
        mechanism to reliably test that.

        Split out FunctionNode from FunctionBodyNode

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This is step toward a parser speedup.

        We used to use FunctionBodyNode for two different purposes:

        (1) "I am the root function you are currently parsing";

        (2) "I am a lazy record of a nested function, which you will parse later".

        This made for awkward lifetime semantics and interfaces.

        Now, case (1) is handled by FunctionBodyNode, and case (2) is handled by
        a new node named FunctionNode.

        Since case (1) no longer needs to handle being the root of the parse
        tree, FunctionBodyNode can be a normal arena-allocated node.

        Previously, the DebuggerAgent was responsible for assigning unique ids to samples.
        However, this makes it impossible for the frontend's Timeline manager to associate
        a Probe Sample timeline record with the corresponding probe sample data. The record
        only included the probe batchId (misnamed as hitCount in ScriptDebugServer).

        This patch moves both the batchId and sampleId counters into ScriptDebugServer, so
        any client of ScriptDebugListener will get the correct sampleId for each sample.

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        Add constructors for Identifier taking AtomicString and AtomicStringImpl.
        This avoids branching on the string's isAtomic flag, which is obviously
        always true for AtomicString & AtomicStringImpl.

        Had to add a Identifier(const char*) constructor to resolve implicit
        ambiguity between String / AtomicString.

        Also made PrivateName::uid() return AtomicStringImpl* to take advantage
        of the new constructor in a few places.

        Add Heap verification infrastructure.
        <https://webkit.org/b/138851>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The verification infrastructure code is always built in but disabled by
        default.  When disabled, the cost is minimal:
        1. Heap has a m_verifier field.
        2. GC does a few "if (m_verifier)" checks that should fail.
        3. HeapVerifier takes up code space though not used.

        When enabled:
        1. The HeapVerifier will keep N number of GC cycle data.
           Each GC cycle will contain a "before marking" and "after marking" live
           object list.
           The GC cycles is a circular buffer.  Only data for the last N GC cycles
           will be retained.
        2. During GC, the current GC cycle's live objects lists will be populated
           before and after marking.
        3. The current GC cycle's live object lists will be validated before GC,
           after marking, and after GC.

        Currently, the only validation being done is to verify that object
        butterflies are allocated from valid blocks in the Storage (aka Copied)
        space.

        In the DFG, we have a ConstantFolding phase that occurs after all LocalCSE
        phases have already transpired.  Hence, Identity nodes introduced in the
        ConstantFolding phase will be left in the node graph.  Subsequently, the
        DFG code generator asserts that CSE phases have consumed all Identity nodes.
        This turns out to not be true.  Hence, the crash.  We fix this by teaching
        the DFG code generator to emit code for Identity nodes.

        Unlike the DFG, the FTL does not have this issue.  That is because the FTL
        plan has GlobalCSE phases that come after ConstantFolding and any other
        phases that can generate Identity nodes.  Hence, for the FTL, it is true that
        CSE will consume all Identity nodes, and the code generator should not see any
        Identity nodes.

        their own copy of all of the probe implementations even when most of it is
        identical.  This patch hoists the common parts into AbstractMacroAssembler
        (with some minor renaming).  Each target specific MacroAssembler now only
        need to implement a few target specific methods that are expected by and
        documented in AbstractMacroAssembler.h in the ENABLE(MASM_PROBE) section.

        In this patch, I also simplified the X86 and X86_64 ports to use the same
        port implementation.  The ARMv7 probe implementation should not conditionally
        exclude the higher FP registers (since the JIT doesn't).  Fixed the ARMv7
        probe code to include the higher FP registers always. 

        This is all done in preparation to add printing functionality in JITted code
        for debugging.

        ARMv7(s) Assembler: LDRH with immediate offset is loading from the wrong offset
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136914

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        TLDR: the immediate offset of half-word load was divided by 2.

        Story time: So I started getting those weird reports of :nth-child() behaving bizarrely
        on ARMv7 and ARMv7s. To make things worse, the behavior changes depending on style updates.

        I started looking the disassembly on the tests cases...

        The first thing I noticed was that the computation of An+B looked wrong. For example,
        in the case of n+6, the instruction should have been:
            subs r1, r1, #6
        but was
            subs r1, r1, #2

        After spending a lot of time trying to find the error in the assembler, I discovered
        the problem was not real, but just a bug in the disassembler.
        This is the first fix: ARMv7DOpcodeAddSubtractImmediate3's immediate3() was truncating
        the value to 2 bits instead of 3 bits.

        The disassembler being fixed, I still have no lead on the weird bug. Some disassembly later,
        I realize the LDRH instruction is not decoded at all. The reason is that both LDRH and STRH
        were under the umbrella ARMv7DOpcodeLoadStoreRegisterImmediateHalfWord but the pattern
        only matched SRTH.

        I fix that next, ARMv7DOpcodeLoadStoreRegisterImmediateHalfWord is split into
        ARMv7DOpcodeStoreRegisterImmediateHalfWord and ARMv7DOpcodeLoadRegisterImmediateHalfWord,
        each with their own pattern and their instruction group.

        Now that I can see the LDRHs correctly, there is something fishy about them, their offset
        is way too small for the data I load.

        This time, looking at the binary, the generated code is indeed incorrect. It turns out that
        the ARMv7 assembler shifted the offset of half-word load as if they were byte load: divided by 4.
        As a result, all the load of half-words with more than zero offset were loading
        values with a smaller offset than what they should have.

        That being fixed, I dump the assembly: still wrong. I am ready to throw my keyboard through
        my screen at that point.

        Looking at the disassembler, there is yet again a bug. The computation of the scale() adjustment
        of the offset was incorrect for anything but word loads.
        I replaced it by a switch-case to make it explicit.

        STRH is likely incorrect too. I'll fix that in a follow up, I want to survey all the 16 bits cases
        that are not directly used by the CSS JIT.

        The JIT should cache property lookup misses.
        <https://webkit.org/b/135578>

        Add support for inline caching of missed property lookups.
        Previously this would banish us to C++ slow path.

        It's implemented as a simple GetById cache that returns jsUndefined()
        as long as the Structure chain check passes. There's no DFG exploitation
        of this knowledge in this patch.

        PutById inline caches should have a store barrier when it triggers a structure transition.
        <https://webkit.org/b/138441>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        After r174025, we no longer insert DFG store barriers when the payload of a
        PutById operation is not a cell.  However, this can lead to a crash when we have
        PutById inline cache code transitioning the structure and re-allocating the
        butterfly of an old gen object.  The lack of a store barrier in that inline
        cache results in the old gen object not being noticed during an eden GC scan.
        As a result, its newly allocated butterfly will not be kept alive, which leads
        to a stale butterfly pointer and, eventually, a crash.

        It is also possible that the new structure can be collected by the eden GC if
        (at GC time):
        1. It is in the eden gen.
        2. The inline cache that installed it has been evicted.
        3. There are no live eden gen objects referring to it.

        The chances of this should be more rare than the butterfly re-allocation, but
        it is still possible.  Hence, the fix is to always add a store barrier if the
        inline caches performs a structure transition.

        Rename checkMarkByte() to jumpIfIsRememberedOrInEden().
        <https://webkit.org/b/138369>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Write barriers are needed for GC Eden collections so that we can scan pointers
        pointing from old generation objects to eden generation objects.  The barrier
        currently checks the mark byte in a cell to see if we should skip adding the
        cell to the GC remembered set.  The addition should be skipped if:

        1. The cell is in the young generation.  It has no old to eden pointers by
           definition.
        2. The cell is already in the remembered set.  While it is ok to add the cell
           to the GC remembered set more than once, it would be redundant.  Hence,
           we skip this as an optimization to avoid doing unnecessary work.

        The barrier currently names this check as checkMarkByte().  We should rename it
        to jumpIfIsRememberedOrInEden() to be clearer about its intent.

        Similarly, Jump results of this check are currently named
        ownerNotMarkedOrAlreadyRemembered.  This can be misinterpreted as the owner is
        not marked or not already remembered.  We should rename it to
        ownerIsRememberedOrInEden which is clearer about the intent of the
        check.  What we are really checking for is that the cell is in the eden gen,
        which is implied by it being "not marked".

        Update scope related slow path code to use scope register added to opcodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138254

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Updated slow paths for op_pop_scope, op_push_name_scope and op_push_with_scope.
        Added scope register index parameter to the front of the relevant argument lists of the
        slow functions.  In the case of op_push_name_scope for x86 (32 bit), there aren't enough
        registers to accomodate all the parameters.  Therefore, added two new JSVALUE32_64 slow
        paths called operationPushCatchScope() and operationPushFunctionNameScope() to eliminate
        the last "type" argument.

        Web Inspector: Generate ObjC inspector protocol types and alternate dispatcher interfaces
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138048

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        Generate Objective-C interfaces for inspector protocol types, command, and event dispatchers.
        This is very much like the InspectorProtocolTypes, BackendDispatchers, and FrontendDispatchers,
        but with an ObjC spin on things.

        The private API that clients would use is all encapsulated in RWIProtocol.h. It includes the
        types interfaces, command handler protocol, and event dispatcher interface. Where possible the
        API uses real enums, which hides the raw protocol enum strings from clients.

        Inspector protocol types are, like InspectorProtocolObjects, built on top of an InspectorObject.
        This offers the flexibilty of adding arbitrary key/values using the RWIProtocolJSONObject
        interface, which may be required for certain protocol objects like "Network.Headers" which
        have no fields, but expect arbitrary properties to be added.

        Command handler protocols always have two callbacks. An error callback and a success callback.
        The signature is very much like BackendDispatchers. In parameters are passed directly to
        the selectors, and out parameters are defined by the success callback. It will be the client's
        responsibility to call either of these callbacks to complete handling of a request.

        Event dispatcher interfaces are straight forward, just packaging up the arguments and sending
        the message to the frontend.

        ObjC <-> Protocol conversion happens in each of the generated files. In type getters / setters,
        in commands parameters and event parameters. For this to work we generate conversion helpers
        for all enums, ObjC enum <-> protocol strings. For NSArray <-> InspectorArray there are some
        static helpers to do the conversions. We do lose some type safety in these conversions.

        Use plain JSArray for RegExp matches instead of a lazily populated custom object.
        <https://webkit.org/b/138191>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        We're already offering two RegExp matching APIs, one that collects subpattern
        matches (exec), and one that simply tests for a match (test).
        Given that, it was pretty overkill to lazily populate the resulting array of
        matches, since the user could simply use test() if they didn't need them.

        This allows the JIT to generate better code for RegExp match arrays, and also
        enables some fast paths in the JSC runtime that check if an object isJSArray().

        Looks like ~1.5% improvement on Octane/regexp according to run-jsc-benchmarks.

        Crash when attempting to perform array iteration on a non-array with numeric keys not initialized.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137814>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        The arrayIteratorNextThunkGenerator() thunk was not checking for the case where
        the butterfly may be NULL.  This was the source of the crash, and is now fixed.

        In addition, it is also not checking for the case where a property named "length"
        may have been set on the iterated object.  The thunk only checks the butterfly's
        publicLength for its iteration operation.  Array objects will work fine with this
        because it always updates its butterfly's publicLength when its length changes.
        In the case of iterable non-Array objects, the "length" property will require a
        look up outside of the scope of this thunk.  The fix is simply to limit the fast
        case checks in this thunk to Array objects.

        Simplified some JSObject methods for converting arrays to ArrayStorage shape.

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Currently, for each Undecided, Int32, Double, and Contiguous array shapes,
        there are 3 JSObject methods to convert them to ArrayStorage shape:
            ArrayStorage* convert<shape>ToArrayStorage(VM&, NonPropertyTransition, unsigned neededLength);
            ArrayStorage* convert<shape>ToArrayStorage(VM&, NonPropertyTransition);
            ArrayStorage* convert<shape>ToArrayStorage(VM&);

        However, the neededLength that is passed is always m_butterfly->vectorLength().
        Hence, the method that takes a neededLength is really not needed.  This patch
        removes this unneeded verbosity.

        Refactoring to simplify some code in DatePrototype.cpp.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137997>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        A bunch of functions in DatePrototype.cpp have the pattern of loading a
        constant into a local variable only to pass it to a callee function
        immediately after.  There is no other use for that variable.  This adds
        additional verbosity with no added benefit.

        This patch refactors those functions to just pass the constant arg directly.

        By definition of calculateLocalTimeOffset, input time should be UTC time.

        So, it gives erroneous results while calculating offset of DST boundary time.
        By adding a argument to distinguish UTC and local time, we can get the correct offset.

        Web Replay: code generator shouldn't complain about enums without a storage type if they are in an enclosing scope
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137084

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        In order to generate encode/decode method declarations without pulling in lots of headers,
        the generator must forward declare enums (for enum classes or enums with explicit sizes).

        Change the generator to not require an explicit size if an enum is declared inside a struct
        or class definition. In that case, it must pull in headers since scoped enums can't be
        forward declared.

        This patch also fixes some chained if-statements that should be if-else statements.

        Test: updated replay/scripts/tests/generate-enum-encoding-helpers.json to cover the new case.

        Web Process crash when starting the web inspector after r174025.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137340>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        After r174025, we can generate a bad graph in the DFG fixup phase like so:

            102:<!0:-> StoreBarrier(Check:KnownCell:@19, ..., bc#44)
            60:<!0:->  PutStructure(Check:KnownCell:@19, ..., bc#44)
            103:<!0:-> Check(Check:NotCell:@54, ..., bc#44)
                    // ^-- PutByOffset's StoreBarrier has been elided and replaced
                    //     with a speculation check which can OSR exit.
            61:<!0:->  PutByOffset(Check:KnownCell:@19, ..., bc#44)

        As a result, the structure change will get executed even if we end up OSR
        exiting before the PutByOffset.  In the baseline JIT code, the structure now
        erroneously tells the put operation that there is a value in that property
        slot when it is actually uninitialized (hence, the crash).

        The fix is to insert the Check at the earliest point possible:

        1. If the checked node is in the same bytecode as the PutByOffset, then
           the earliest point where we can insert the Check is right after the
           checked node.

        2. If the checked node is from a preceding bytecode (before the PutByOffset),
           then the earliest point where we can insert the Check is at the start
           of the current bytecode.

        Also reverted the workaround from r174749: https://webkit.org/b/137758.

        Benchmark results appear to be a wash on aggregate.

        to convert into a CheckStructure node safely in the DFG. 

        This change brings up the conversion rate from ProfileType to Check 
        or CheckStructrue from ~45% to ~65%. This change also speeds the 
        type profiler up significantly: consistently between 2x-20x faster.

        itself.

        Ensure that inline assembly Thunk functions don't conflict with the section designations of the compiler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137434

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        The ARM64 version of the defineUnaryDoubleOpWrapper macro in
        ThunkGenerators.cpp contains inline assembly with .text assembler
        directive followed by a static variable declaration. This macro gets
        expanded several times afterwards, however, only during the compilation
        of the first expansion does gcc insert a .data assembler directive
        before the assembled version of the static variable. Thus, only the
        first variable gets allocated in the .data section, all the others
        remain in .text. If JavaScriptCore is built as a shared library then
        this causes a segmentation fault during dynamic linking.

        This patch puts a .previous directive at the end of the inline assembly
        to ensure that the assumptions of the compiler about the sections are
        not broken and the following variable goes to the right place.

        Fairly simple change.  If we have a lexical record we need to pull the unmodified
        arguments object from the record and then use the standard op_tear_off_arguments
        instruction on the temporary.
