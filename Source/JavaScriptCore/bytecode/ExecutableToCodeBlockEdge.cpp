    // But both choices could lead to bad perf - either recomp cycles or leaks.

    // Determining CodeBlock liveness: This part is the most consequential. We want to keep the
    // output constraint active so long as we think that we may yet prove that the CodeBlock is
    // live but we haven't done it yet.
    //
    // Marking Structures if profitable: It's important that we do a pass of this. Logically, this
    // seems like it is a constraint of CodeBlock. But we have always first run this as a result
    // of the edge being marked even before we determine the liveness of the CodeBlock. This
    // allows a CodeBlock to mark itself by first proving that all of the Structures it weakly
    // depends on could be strongly marked. (This part is also called propagateTransitions.)
    //
    // As a weird caveat, we only fixpoint the constraints so long as the CodeBlock is not live.
    // This means that we may overlook structure marking opportunities created by other marking
    // that happens after the CodeBlock is marked. This was an accidental policy decision from a
    // long time ago, but it is probably OK, since it's only worthwhile to keep fixpointing the
    // structure marking if we still have unmarked structures after the first round. We almost
    // never will because we will mark-if-profitable based on the owning global object being
    // already marked. We mark it just in case that hadn't happened yet. And if the CodeBlock is
    // not yet marked because it weakly depends on a structure that we did not yet mark, then we
    // will keep fixpointing until the end.
