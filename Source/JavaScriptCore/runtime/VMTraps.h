    // The following are the type of VMTrap events / signals that can be fired.
    // This list should be sorted in servicing priority order from highest to
    // lowest.
    //
    // The currently imlemented events are (in highest to lowest priority):
    //
    //  NeedShellTimeoutCheck
    //  - Only used by the jsc shell to check if we need to force a hard shutdown.
    //  - This event may fire more than once before the jsc shell forces the
    //    shutdown (see NeedWatchdogCheck's discussion of CPU time for why
    //    this may be).
    //
    //  NeedTermination
    //  - Used to request the termination of execution of the "current" stack.
    //    Note: "Termination" here simply means we terminate whatever is currently
    //    executing on the stack. It does not mean termination of the VM, and hence,
    //    is not permanent. Permanent VM termination mechanisms (like stopping the
    //    request to stop a woker thread) may use this Event to terminate the
    //    "current" stack, but it needs to do some additional work to prevent
    //    re-entry into the VM.
    //
    //  - The mechanism for achieving this stack termination is by throwing the
    //    uncatchable TerminationException that piggy back on the VM's exception
    //    handling machinery to the unwind stack. The TerminationException is
    //    uncatchable in the sense that the VM will refuse to let JS code's
    //    catch handlers catch the exception. C++ code in the VM (that calls into
    //    JS) needs to do exception checks, and make sure to propagate the
    //    exception if it is the TerminationException.
    //
    //  - Again, the termination request is not permanent. Once the VM unwinds out
    //    of the "current" execution state on the stack, the client may choose to
    //    clear the exception, and re-enter the VM to executing JS code again.
    //    See NeedWatchdogCheck below on why the VM watchdog needs this ability
    //    to re-enter the VM after terminating the current stack.
    //
    //  - Many clients enter the VM via APIs that return an uncaught exception
    //    in a NakedPointer<Exception>&. Those APIs would automatically clear
    //    the uncaught TerminationException and return it via the
    //    NakedPointer<Exception>&. Hence, the VM is ready for re-entry upon
    //    returning to the client.
    //
    //  - In the above notes, "current" (as in "current" stack) is in quotes because
    //    NeedTermination needs to guarantee that the TerminationException has
    //    been thrown in response to this event. If the event fires just before
    //    the VM exits and the TerminationException was not thrown yet, then we'll
    //    keep the NeedTermination trap bit set for the next VM entry. In this case,
    //    the termination will actual happen on the next stack of execution.
    //
    //    This behavior is needed because some clients rely on seeing an uncaught
    //    TerminationException to know that a termination has been requested.
    //    Technically, there are better ways for the client to know about the
    //    termination request (after all, the termination is initiated by the
    //    client). However, this is how some current client code works. So, we need
    //    to retain this behavior until we can change all the clients that rely on
    //    it.
    //
    //  NeedWatchdogCheck
    //  - Used to request a check as to whether the watchdog timer has expired.
    //    Note: the watchdog timeout is logically measured in CPU time. However,
    //    the real timer implementation (that fires this NeedWatchdogCheck event)
    //    has to operate on wall clock time. Hence, NeedWatchdogCheck firing does not
    //    necessarily mean that the watchdog timeout has expired, and we can expect
    //    to see NeedWatchdogCheck firing more than once for a single watchdog
    //    timeout.
    //
    //  - The watchdog mechanism has the option to request termination of the
    //    the current execution stack on watchdog timeout (see
    //    Watchdog::shouldTerminate()). If termination is requested, it will
    //    be executed via the same mechanism as NeedTermination (see how the
    //    NeedWatchdogCheck case can fall through to the NeedTermination case in
    //    VMTraps::handleTraps()).
    //
    //  - The watchdog timing out is not permanent i.e. after terminating the
    //    current stack, the client may choose to re-enter the VM to execute more
    //    JS. For example, a client may use the watchdog to ensure that an untrusted
    //    3rd party script (that it runs) does not get trapped in an infinite loop.
    //    If so, the watchdog timeout can terminate that script. After terminating
    //    that bad script, the client may choose to allow other 3rd party scripts
    //    to execute, or even allow more tries on the current one that timed out.
    //    Hence, the timeout and termination must not be permanent.
    //
    //    This is why termination via the NeedTermination event is not permanent,
    //    but only terminates the "current" stack.
    //
    //  NeedDebuggerBreak
    //  - Services asynchronous debugger break requests.
    //
    //  NeedExceptionHandling
    //  - Unlike the other events (which are asynchronous to the mutator thread),
    //    NeedExceptionHandling is set when the mutator thread throws a JS exception
    //    and cleared when the exception is handled / caught.
    //
    //  - The reason why NeedExceptionHandling is a bit on VMTraps as well is so
    //    that we can piggy back on all the RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION checks in C++ code
    //    to service VMTraps as well. Having the NeedExceptionHandling event as
    //    part of VMTraps allows RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION to optimally only do a single
    //    check to determine if the VM possibly has a pending exception to handle,
    //    as well as if there are asynchronous VMTraps events to handle.
