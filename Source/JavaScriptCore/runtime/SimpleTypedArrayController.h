// The default controller used for managing the relationship between
// array buffers and their wrappers in JavaScriptCore. This isn't what
// WebCore uses, but it is what JSC uses when running standalone. This
// is pretty simple:
//
// - If the JSArrayBuffer is live, then the ArrayBuffer stays alive.
//
// - If there is a JSArrayBufferView that is holding an ArrayBuffer
//   then any existing wrapper for that ArrayBuffer will be kept
//   alive.
//
// - If you ask an ArrayBuffer for a JSArrayBuffer after one had
//   already been created and it didn't die, then you get the same
//   one.
