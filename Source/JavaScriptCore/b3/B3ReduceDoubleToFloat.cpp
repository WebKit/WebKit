// The goal of this phase is to transform Double operations

//
// In C, that would be something like:
//     float add(float a, float b) {
//         return (double)a + (double)b;
//     }
//
// Such operation arise in JS because there are is no Float type
// and float operations are generated by adding double-to-float rounding.
//
// The operations can be done entirely without Double conversion.
// Using float in place remove the useless conversion, and the float
// ops is sometime massively cheaper (SQRT for example).
//
// If the Double value is used as Double, we do not do the conversion.
// It is cheaper to do a conversion than repeat any floating-point operation.
