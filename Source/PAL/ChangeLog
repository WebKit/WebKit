        Introducing the Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143358

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Introduce a new top-level folder and static library. This is intended to be
        the destination for code that currently resides in WebCore/platform. Code
        will be moved from that folder into PAL file by file. Separating this
        platform code into its own static library enforces layering, as well as
        encourages/aids unit testing of this platform code.

        This commit only creates a single symbol which is not required to build
        WebKit. The reason for this is so that we can get all build issues ironed
        out before requiring PAL.
