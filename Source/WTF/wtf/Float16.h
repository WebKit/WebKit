     * - Inf and NaN values in the inputs should become Inf and NaN values after conversion to the single-precision number.
     *   Therefore, if the biased exponent of the half-precision input was 0x1F (max possible value), the biased exponent
     *   of the single-precision output must be 0xFF (max possible value). We do this correction in two steps:
     *   - First, we adjust the exponent by (0xFF - 0x1F) = 0xE0 (see exp_offset below) rather than by 0x70 suggested
     *     by the difference in the exponent bias (see above).
     *   - Then we multiply the single-precision result of exponent adjustment by 2**(-112) to reverse the effect of
     *     exponent adjustment by 0xE0 less the necessary exponent adjustment by 0x70 due to difference in exponent bias.
     *     The floating-point multiplication hardware would ensure than Inf and NaN would retain their value on at least
     *     partially IEEE754-compliant implementations.
     *
     * Note that the above operations do not handle denormal inputs (where biased exponent == 0). However, they also do not
     * operate on denormal inputs, and do not produce denormal results.

     * In a denormalized number the biased exponent is zero, and mantissa has on-zero bits.

     *
     * Now, remember that denormalized half-precision numbers are represented as:
     *    FP16 = mantissa * 2**(-24).
     * The trick is to construct a normalized single-precision number with the same mantissa and thehalf-precision input
     * and with an exponent which would scale the corresponding mantissa bits to 2**(-24).
     * A normalized single-precision floating-point number is represented as:
     *    FP32 = (1 + mantissa * 2**(-23)) * 2**(exponent - 127)
     * Therefore, when the biased exponent is 126, a unit change in the mantissa of the input denormalized half-precision
     * number causes a change of the constructud single-precision number by 2**(-24), i.e. the same ammount.
     *
     * The last step is to adjust the bias of the constructed single-precision number. When the input half-precision number
     * is zero, the constructed single-precision number has the value of
     *    FP32 = 1 * 2**(126 - 127) = 2**(-1) = 0.5
