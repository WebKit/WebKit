        [Cocoa] [GTK] RunLoop::Timer::isActive() is incorrect for timers while they are firing

        In WebKit timer parlance "isActive()" means "will fire again", so a

        there's no way to check if it needs to be rescheduled.

        1. Added FailureAction so that we can parameterize how we want to handle failures.
           In this patch, we're only using this for allocation failures, but we could
           technically apply this to other types of failures as well.

        2. Apply FailureAction to many methods in Vector (and its super classes) so that
           we can start de-duplicating code.  Previously, we were always duplicating code
           just to have a "try" version of the same method that reports the failure to
           allocate instead of crashing.  We can now parameterize all these methods on a
           FailureAction template parameter instead, and avoid the code duplication.
           This patch also reverses some of the existing code duplication.

        Reasons:

        (3) People seem to get confused about the relationship between

        initializeThreading() is a superset. The opposite is true! I think the

        Removed the 50ms rescheduling timeout from callOnMainThread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213560

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        This is a step toward making the engine less flaky by unifying
        callOnMainThread with RunLoop::dispatch.

        The timeout was added in r40888 to avoid a hang under heavy postMessage
        load. A few reasons this isn’t the right approach anymore:

        (1) postMessage has migrated to EventLoop, which does its own
        scheduling.

        (2) postMessage does not use the application process RunLoop in Modern
        WebKit.

        (3) Delay is not a sufficient solution to a messaging hang — because
        you’ll just OOM crash instead. The original author noted this problem
        in bug 23705 but never resolved it; and we rediscovered it in r233111.

        I verified manually that the r40888 version of
        fast/workers/worker-timeout.html does not hang.

        Meanwhile, setMainThreadCallbacksPaused doesn't pause RunLoop::dispatch.
        So, other things don't get paused.

        Let's just rely on suspending the ScriptExecutionContext and document

        The purpose of ASCIILiteral is ensure that this is compile-time (do not need to consider about ownership) ASCII characters.
        By using `isASCII` and `ASSERT_UNDER_CONSTEXPR_CONTEXT`, we can make sure that this C string does not include non ASCII characters.
        For example,

            auto globalVariable = "ラーメン (Ramen in Japanese)"_s;

        when testing my change.

        Anyway, we can just create an empty PlatformRegisters object when HAVE(MACHINE_CONTEXT) is
        false. At first, I was worried that passing an empty PlatformRegisters could be open to
        misuse, but it's actually hard to misuse it because the only sensible thing you can do with
        it is pass it to MachineContext, and you can't use MachineContext outside
        HAVE(MACHINE_CONTEXT), so we should be good.

        LLDB does not like it when we single step while there are mach exception

        With Mach exception handlers installed, the OS will send a mach message
        to our exception handler port, which is different than the active thread.
        When this happens, the combination of LLDB and the process JSC is in effectively
        deadlock.

        Under our new approach, we go back to only telling the OS we care about
        these exceptions late but lock down the function pointers early. This way

        Always use the RunLoop API for main thread tasks.

        Previously, callOnMainThread sometimes scheduled a timer and sometimes

        with the intention to establish a single point of execution. Now, it has
        the opposite effect.)

        I picked the RunLoop API rather than the timer API because it moves us
        closer to universally applying the RunLoop speedup in

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        We now think of the various Config records as being allocated from parts of a
        WebConfig::g_config buffer.  WTF::Config will manage the mechanics of freezing
        that buffer.  And the JSC VM is still the determiner of if/when to freeze the
        buffer, and it will do this at the end of the construction of the very first
        VM instance (as before).

        Gigacage::Config reserves space in WebConfig::g_config.
        WTF::Config will honor that reservation and place itself after that.
        JSC::Config will continue to place itself at WTF::Config::spaceForExtensions.

        The upside of this approach this is that we can now share the same memory page
        for all the Configs, and can freeze them in one go.

        The downside is that g_gigacageConfig, g_wtfConfig, and g_jscConfig now have to
        be macros.  This results in some weirdness e.g. they are no longer qualified by
        namespaces: referring to WTF::g_wtfConfig is now incorrect.

        This only changes behavior in code that is marked as UNLIKELY because it can only be reached by invalid unicode URLs,
        but it can be reached and should behave in a reasonable manner in those cases.  This makes Safari behave more similarly
        to Firefox in this case instead of doing something similar to no other browser.

        Implement a faster findBitInWord() using the hardware ctz instruction.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212032
        <rdar://problem/63348086>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Based on local microbenchmarking, both ARM64 and X86_64 shows a speed up of
        28% - 95% faster than the loop.

        The largest perf regressions for ctz vs the loop, are when finding 1 in a mostly
        set word or finding 0 in a mostly cleared word. For example, on X86_64:
            Find 1 in 0xffffffffffffffff: using loop 8.67 ms, using ctz 6.07 ms, delta 30.0%
            Find 0 in 0x8000000000000000: using loop 9.01 ms, using ctz 6.54 ms, delta 28.1%

        The largest perf progressions for ctz vs the loop, are the opposite: finding 1 in
        a mostly cleared word, or finding a 0 in a mostly set word. For example, on X86_64:
            Find 1 in 0x8000000000000000: using loop 91.4 ms, using ctz 6.48 ms, delta 92.9%
            Find 0 in 0xffffffffffffffff: using loop 91.7 ms, using ctz 6.95 ms, delta 92.4%

        TL;DR: the microbenchmark methodology used:

        findBitInWord() takes:
            a. word to scan
            b. startIndex
            c. endIndex
            d. bool value to scan for, either 1 or 0.

        1. Randomly select 1000 startIndex and endIndex pairs.
           The endIndex is guaranteed to be >= startIndex.

        2. Using a base word of 0xffffffffffffffff (or uint64_t) and 0xffffffff (for uint32_t),
           shift left by 0 - N (where N is the number of bits in the word) to generate
           N + 1 words for the test.  This produces words with contiguous lengths of 1s
           and 0s.  We're choosing these words to deliberately measure the effects o
           run lengths of 0s or 1s on the algorithm in use.

        3. For each test word, call findBitInWord() with the start and end indexes chosen
           in 1 for a 100 iterations.

        4. Run (3) once to search for a true value, and once to search for a false value.

        5. Print the results for each test word and value pair.

        AtomString::init should temporarily disable checks via `isMainThread` due to WebThread's inconsistent state
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211754

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When starting WebThread via StartWebThread function, we have special period between the prologue of StartWebThread and spawning WebThread actually.
        In this period, `isMainThread()` returns false even if this is called on the main thread since WebThread is now enabled and we are not taking a WebThread lock.
        This causes assertion hits in MainThreadLazyNeverDestroyed initialization only in WebThread platforms.

        This patch takes conservative approach to fix this assertion hits: just bypass these assertions since this should not be fired. We bypass assertions by using
        constructWithoutAccessCheck, which intentionally skips `isMainThread()` check for construction. In non WebThread environment, we do not lose the assertion
        coverage since we already have ASSERT(isUIThread()). And ASSERT(isUIThread()) ensures that this is called in system main thread in WebThread platforms.

        Unfortunately, we have no mechanism to test this effectively. WK1 LayoutTests runner cannot show assertions since WK1 runners already initialize necessary
        things somewhere before calling AtomString::init() in StartWebThread. This is the same in TestWebKitAPI. For now, I manually tested that assertion does not fire.

        Introduce WTF::Config and put Signal.cpp's init-once globals in it.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211729
        <rdar://problem/62938878>

        Reviewed by Keith Miller and Saam Barati.

        1. Added WTF::Config for storing globals that effectively serve as constants i.e
           we'll be initializing them before or during the first VM instantiation, but
           should not have any reason to modify them later.  The WTF::Config will be frozen
           (along with JSC::Config) at the end of instantiating the first VM instance.

        2. Added a Config::AssertNotFrozenScope RAII object to ensure that initialization
           operations that should only be called at initialization time, will not be
           called once the Config has been frozen.

        3. Moved most of Signal.cpp's globals into WTF::Config.  The only globals (or
           statics) not moved are ones that cannot be moved because they require a
           non-trivial default constructor (once_flag), or need to be modifiable
           at runtime (e.g. Lock).

           Instead of freezing the once_flag, we sanity check the call_once block with
           the Config::AssertNotFrozenScope.

        4. SignalHandler records are now allocated from arrays of SignalHandlerMemory in
           the WTF::Config.  The number of signal handlers we will ever install is always
           finite.  Hence, there's no reason to use a dynamic data structure like the
           LocklessBag to hold it.

           We introduce a SignalHandlers struct to manage these arrays (and all the other
           Signal.cpp globals that we want to move to the WTF::Config).  Amongst other
           things, SignalHandlers provides the abstractions for:

           a. allocating memory for the SignalHandler instances.  See SignalHandlers::alloc().
           b. iterating SignalHandler instances. See SignalHandlers::forEachHandler().

           To maintain the synchronization properties of the LocklessBag,
           SignalHandlers::alloc() uses a mutex.  In practice, this mutex will never be
           contended on because all signal handlers are now installed at initialization
           time before any concurrency comes into play.

        5. We now initialize activeThreads() eagerly via initializeThreading.  In
           production configurations, this does not matter because signal handler
           installations will always trigger its initialization.  However, in debugging
           configurations, we may end up disabling the use of all signal handlers.  As a
           result, we need to do this eager initialization to ensure that it is done
           before we freeze the WTF::Config.

        Add copy constructor and assignment operator to Ref<>
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211705

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        As recently discussed in some WebKit bug patch review, we think that Ref and RefPtr
        should have the same design, except for whether the value can be null. Ref had a
        more ambitious approach to avoiding reference count churn, requiring a
        call to copyRef to make any copying explicit, partly by analogy with raw C
        references, which also can't be copied (but they can't be moved either). We choose
        to change Ref to match RefPtr and to take the risk of additional churn. This makes
        it easier to use Ref in contexts like collection classes and structures. An
        alternative would be to go the other direction, and make RefPtr require a call to
        copyRef: seems like an obviously worse option.

        * wtf/Ref.h: Add the copy constructor and assignment operator.
        These follow a similar pattern to the move constructor and assignment operator.
        Also add a deprecation comment before copyRef, which we will eventually remove.

        Allow Bitmap to use up to a UCPURegister word size for internal bit storage.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211328
        <rdar://problem/62755865>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        1. Moved the definition of CPURegister and UCPURegister down into WTF.
           Added CPU(REGISTER64) and CPU(REGISTER32) for determining what size a CPU
           general purpose register is.

        2. Updated Bitmap so that it will automatically choose the minimal required
           word size for the number of bits it needs to store.  This means the Bitmap
           can automatically choose a WordType from uint8_t up to UCPURegister.
           Previously, the WordType is always uint32_t by default.

           This should improve perf with use of Bitmap on 64-bit platforms.  The size
           optimization is necessary to prevent bloat on 64-bit platforms which would have
           resulted if we simply set the default to always be UCPURegister.

        3. Added a check in findRunOfZeros() for handling the edge case where the
           requested runLength exceeds the bitmapSize.

        4. Fixed a bug in count() that was unnecessarily casting the bits to unsigned
           instead of just using the Bitmap WordType.  As a result, when using a WordType
           of uint64_t, it was discarding bits from the count.

        5. Fixed invert() to leave the bits beyond bitmapSize untouched.
           Fixed isFull() to ignore the bits beyond bitmapSize.

           By fixing invert() to leave those bits as 0, isEmpty() and hash() will
           continue to work.  Otherwise, inverting those bits will cause isEmpty() to
           always fail, and hash()'s result may be different for the same set of bit
           values within bitmapSize.

           isFull(), on the other hand, checks for set bits in the words.  Since there
           may be 0 valued bits beyond bitmapSize, isFull() needs to be fixed to ignore
           those.

        Bitmap::operator[] never worked.  There's currently no way to use it to read a

        Bitmap::iterator::operator= to set the value.  However, Bitmap::iterator stores
        the Bitmap* as a const pointer, and Bitmap::iterator::operator= calls set() on
        the const pointer.  If we try to use operator[] to set a bit, we'll get a
        compilation error.

        U_STRING_NOT_TERMINATED_WARNING ICU must be handled when using the output buffer as a C string
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211142
        <rdar://problem/62530860>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Most of our uses of ICU require us to produce a buffer of the correct
        length. We often test if the first call to ICU API succeeds, and if it
        doesn't, we grow to the required buffer size, and try again. However,
        there are a few APIs that we use like this, except that they write their
        output to a C string instead of a buffer.
        
        In a couple scenarios when we were producing C strings, we were only testing
        for the U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR, instead of both U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR and
        U_STRING_NOT_TERMINATED_WARNING. This patch fixes those bugs. It also
        introduces two new helper methods for testing error codes returned by ICU.
        
        - The first is needsToGrowToProduceBuffer, which returns true if we need to
        grow the buffer and re-call into ICU to get the result.
        - The second is needsToGrowToProduceCString, which returns true if we need to
        grow the buffer and re-call into ICU to produce a valid C string.
        
        I've audited all uses of U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR and converted them to use one
        of the above helper methods instead.
        
        The issues in our handling of U_STRING_NOT_TERMINATED_WARNING were caught on iOS JSC
        tests in JSTests/stress/intl-datetimeformat.js

        [Cocoa] Use createNSArray in many more places that build NSArray objects from C++ collections
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210702

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        * wtf/cocoa/VectorCocoa.h: Improved the createNSArray function template:
        1) Skip nil values. This matches what we do with Optional<> in makeVector and
           was always my intention; apparently forgot to do it.
        2) Instead of taking a const reference argument, take a forwarding reference
           and use forwarding when passing collection elements to makeNSArrayElement
           or the passed-in function. Can transfer ownership of collection elements
           as they are transformed into array elements, which makes sense if the
           Objective-C objects are wrappers that take ownership of what's wrapped.
        3) Take any collection that works with std::size and a range-based for loop,
           no longer requiring a size member function. Includes arrays.
        4) Since this now intended for use on collections other than WTF::Vector,
           added "using WTF::createNSArray" since argument-dependent lookup won't
           find the function template in those cases.

        [Clang 10] Fix warning: definition of implicit copy assignment operator for 'PageBlock' is deprecated because it has a user-declared copy constructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210748

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        Recent Clang's will issue a warning if you declare an explicit
        copy construction, but leave the compiler to fill in an implicit
        assignment operator. I think this is to catch cases where you do
        something exciting in an assignment operator/copy constructor and
        forget to do the same exciting thing in the other.

        * wtf/PageAllocation.h: Import the base's constructor to avoid

        * wtf/PageBlock.h: Remove trivial constructor and replace with

        scoping would prove non-ergonomic or where running the unlocked section is only
        necessary or desired when a certain condition is met -- something that cannot
        be done with C++ scoping.

        Safety mechanisms are provided. First, because this is used with a lambda, all
        variables to be used in the unlocked section have to be specified in the
        capture (global capture is possible but not recommended to simplify analysis).
        Second, additional checks have been added to DataMutex to detect unlocked
        accesses among other conditions. This will detect among other things naive
        access to protected members by means of capturing the LockedWrapper by
        reference.

        The current tagCFunctionPtr() tool does some extra work that is not needed if

        3. The RELEASE_ASSERT used to enforce that authentication can also go away.

        We should only use tagCFunction() (instead of tagCFunctionPtr()) if we know for

        [Clang 10] Fix -Wimplicit-int-float-conversion compilation warnings in WTF
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209955

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Clang 10 reports a compilation warning for int to float
        conversions losing the precision. The warning is often reported
        for code converting a floating point value to an integer value.
        For example:

        > Optional<int> positive_float_to_int(float f) {
        >     if (f > INT_MAX)
        >         return nullopt;
        >     return static_cast<int>(f);
        > }

        INT_MAX is implicitly converted float, but float can't keep the
        precision of such large value. And, C++ spec doesn't specify
        whether it would be rounded up or down. Above code should be
        rewritten to:

        > Optional<int> positive_float_to_int(float f) {
        >     if (f >= pow(2, 31))
        >         return nullopt;
        >     return static_cast<int>(f);
        > }

        Instead of using pow, this change added a template variable
        maxPlusOne<T>.

        RELEASE_ASSERT() when CeilingOnPageSize is wrong, so we can detect and fix it if so. (It
        will be even easier to detect if we change RELEASE_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE() to actually print
        its message in release builds.) Change pageSize() to use sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE), which is

        [WTF] Add signpost API
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208395

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        We want to start using os_signpost instead of kdebug_trace when emitting performance events,
        because it is usually cheaper (doesn't require a system call unless the log buffer is full)
        and allows for richer tracepoints (allows for logging strings as well as integers).

        To facilitate this, this moves the os_signpost wrappers in NetworkDataTaskCocoa to
        WTF. Since signposts can contain sensitive strings (like URLs), currently we only enable
        them on Apple-internal devices when an environment variable is set.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        When debugging on iOS writing to a file can be hard (thanks
        Sandboxing!)  so logging our dataLogs to os_log would make things
        easier. This patch adds a new subclass of PrintStream,
        OSLogPrintStream, that converts our file writes to
        os_log. Unfortunately, os_log doesn't buffer writes so
        OSLogPrintStream needs to do its own buffering. e.g. if you call
        `dataLogLn("some text with a ", number, " and a ", string);`
        os_log will log that as 5 separate logs.

        WTF_EXPORT is still used mostly in *ExportMacros.h. However, there is no

        This patch changes the load-factor from 50% to 75%. But we pick 75% only for

        Reduce size of HashMap and HashSet
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207138

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        This reduces sizeof(HashMap) and sizeof(HashSet) from 24 to 8 on 64-bit systems.
        I measured that the overwhelming majority of HashMaps and HashSets never see more than 0 elements,
        so I moved the table metadata (tableSize, tableSizeMask, keyCount, deletedCount) to inside the
        dynamically allocated memory.  This makes another branch in size() for non-empty tables
        and an additional read and write when rehashing in exchange for fewer writes in the constructor
        and increased cache locality of everything that uses HashMap and HashSet, which is basically everything.

        Start splitting platform specific overrides of default enable behavior into their own files
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207105

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Splits out platform specific overrides of default enable behavior into separate files, 
        starting with one for all of the Cocoa related ports, one for Apple's Windows port, and
        one for the WinCario port.
        
        The rule is now that all ENABLE_* macros should have a default defined in PlatformEnable.h,
        but platforms are allowed to override it via their PlatformEnable*.h file. For now, I manually
        ensured that all the defines in PlatformEnableCocoa.h, PlatformEnableWinApple.h and PlatformEnableWinCairo.h
        also had defaults in PlatformEnable.h, but going forward this needs be validated either through
        some sort of macro-based validation, through the style checker or something else.

        [WTF] Make MediaTime constructor constexpr
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206036

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205723 allowed to declare
        MediaTime variables as static inside functions without needing a
        global destructor.

        It did not eliminate the call to the MediaTime constructor on runtime
        though. This wasn't a problem for static variables inside functions,
        as the compiler adds a guard variable to call the constructor the
        first time the function is called.

        On the other hand, for variables defined outside of the scope of the
        function, for them to be initialized the MediaTime constructor would
        have to be called at runtime from a global constructor, something
        we're trying to avoid and which generates an error in clang.

        But again, MediaTime is a simple class with only integral values, we
        shouldn't need a runtime function call to initialize it!

        This patch makes the MediaTime constructor constexpr so that we don't
        need runtime initialization for static MediaTime variables. This
        allows us to declare them outside functions and enables the compiler
        to generate code without guard variables when static MediaTime
        variables are declared inside functions.

        A test has been added accessing a global const static MediaTime. The
        build should not produce any error stating the need for a global
        constructor.

        We ask the system for the current locale using CFLocaleCopyPreferredLanguages(), and then round-trip

        This was to work around the fact that CFLocaleCopyPreferredLanguages() previously didn't report BCP47
        language codes. However, that round-tripping was introducing errors, such as "zh-Hant-HK" was getting
        turned into "zh-Hant-TW" which is clearly wrong. The CFBundle functions were never supposed to be used
        in this way.

        Instead, we can use CFLocaleCreateCanonicalLanguageIdentifierFromString() which is intended to
        canonicalize locale identifiers, and does return BCP47 language codes. However, this function preserves
        more fingerprinting entropy than the old code path, so we pass the input through new NSLocale SPI to
        minimize the entropy revealed.

        Reduce binary size by purging C++ type information in Objective-C fields and parameters
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205905

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Objective-C has reflection mechanisms. This means that fields, methods, and their types
        need to hold its string representations in binary even if we are using release build.
        While typical Objective-C class does not have large size of type names, C++ struct / class
        has very large one, and putting them in Objective-C method names, parameter types, or fields
        makes binary size very large.

        Interesting thing is that type information is gathered when parameter is a C++ pointer, reference,
        or value. And it gathers one-level deep information from this pointer etc. This means that, if
        we use RefPtr<T>, collected type information is the one of RefPtr, not one of T. So it becomes significantly
        smaller.

        This patch introduces NakedRef<T>. This is similar to Ref while it does not have any ownership. So it
        is just a wrapper around T&. We already have NakedPtr<T>. And use NakedRef<T> / NakedPtr<T> instead
        of T& and T* if,

            1. T is C++ class.
            2. T* / T& is in Objective-C fields or parameter types (including a return type).

        Then, these type information is one of NakedRef<T> / NakedPtr<T> instead of T, and we can reduce binary size.

        This patch saves 600~KB in binary size.

        Note the following things.

        1. If we use `__attribute__((objc_direct))`, `__attribute__((objc_direct_members))`, possibly, we can completely remove these
           metadata without using NakedRef / NakedPtr[1]. However, this is not available for our supporting platforms now (including
           pre-Catalina OSes). This NakedRef / NakedPtr technique can reduce binary without waiting for it.
        2. Reverting NakedRef / NakedPtr to usual reference / pointer is fairly easy since it is well typed. Once `__attribute__((objc_direct))`
           becomes available in our platforms, we can consider it. But using NakedRef / NakedPtr is harmless.

        [WTF] Allow MediaTime static constants
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205723

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Despite all its convenience methods, at its core MediaTime is a rather
        trivial class with only integral members. Despite this, since it had a
        destructor declared, this made the class non-trivially destructible
        even if the implementation was empty, and therefore clang did not
        allow to use it for static variables unless done in form of a pointer.

        By removing the destructor this restriction is lifted and we don't
        need heap allocations for static MediaTime objects.

        Previous usages of heap allocation for static MediaTime objects have
        been rewritten to take advantage of this. Test coverage is provided by
        successful compilation without [-Werror,-Wexit-time-destructors]

        Convert ASSERT_DISABLED to ASSERT_ENABLED, and fix some tests of NDEBUG that should actually test for ASSERT_ENABLED.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205776

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch did the following changes:

        1. Replaced ASSERT_DISABLED with ASSERT_ENABLED.  This change does away
           with the need for the double negative !ASSERT_DISABLED test that is commonly
           used all over the code, thereby improving code readability.

           In Assertions.h, there is also BACKTRACE_DISABLED, ASSERT_MSG_DISABLED,
           ASSERT_ARG_DISABLED, FATAL_DISABLED, ERROR_DISABLED, LOG_DISABLED, and
           RELEASE_LOG_DISABLED.  We should replace those with ..._ENABLED equivalents
           as well.  We'll do that in another patch.  For now, they are left as is to
           minimize the size of this patch.
           See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205780.

        2. Fixed some code was guarded with "#ifndef NDEBUG" that should actually be
           guarded by "#if ASSERT_ENABLED" instead.

        3. In cases where the change is minimal, we move some code around so that we can
           test for "#if ASSERT_ENABLED" instead of "#if !ASSERT_ENABLED".

        Experiment: create lots of different malloc zones for easier accounting of memory use
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186422

        To achieve this goal without making very large change, we put a template type in various containers.
        For example, Vector will take Malloc parameter (the default one is FastMalloc allocator). If ENABLE(MALLOC_HEAP_BREAKDOWN) is enabled, we change this to
        specific VectorMalloc allocator, and vmmap can show memory usage of this allocator. This patch also supports malloc_zone per IsoHeap. So we can see memory
        allocation per IsoHeap in vmmap.

        To use this feature, we need to flip two compile time flags, ENABLE(MALLOC_HEAP_BREAKDOWN) in WTF and BENABLE_MALLOC_HEAP_BREAKDOWN in bmalloc.
        And use `vmmap $PID` to dump malloc zones. To allocate objects of a class with a specific malloc-zone, use WTF_MAKE_FAST_ALLOCATED_WITH_HEAP_IDENTIFIER(HeapIdentifier) for the class,
        and define allocator by DECLARE_ALLOCATOR_WITH_HEAP_IDENTIFIER(HeapIdentifier) in a header and DEFINE_ALLOCATOR_WITH_HEAP_IDENTIFIER(HeapIdentifier) in a cpp file.

        This patch also introduce callstack collector for malloc. Vector, HashMap etc. are used to allocate various things, but the above malloc_zone feature only tells thing like "Vector
        takes XXX MB memory". But what we want to know in this case is what Vector is consuming memory. We collect StackShot for each malloc call, and combine these information to tell
        which callsite is consuming much memory, which tell us that what Vector is consuming memory.

        In an ongoing attempt to simplify the StringBuilder interface and unify it's functionality with makeString,
        this change removes appendFixedPrecisionNumber() and appendFixedWidthNumber(), replacing their uses

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204572

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        This patch adds the following changes:

         - Use uint32_t instead of size_t to store the body size in the message header, because size_t has a different
           size in 32 and 64 bit platforms.
         - Use htonl/ntohl to write/read the body size in the header.
         - Add a flags byte to the header to include the message byte order. The sender always uses the host byter order
           and the receiver does the byte swapping if needed.

        We haven't supported an upwards growing stack in years, and a lot of code has
        since been written specifically with only a downwards growing stack in mind (e.g.
        the LLInt, the JITs).  Also, all our currently supported platforms use a downward
        growing stack.

        We should remove the remnants of support code for an upwards growing stack.  The
        presence of that code is deceptive in that it conveys support for an upwards
        growing stack where this hasn't been the case in years.

        WTF::RunLoop should not depend on isMainThread() idiom.

        <rdar://problem/56524251>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati, Ryosuke Niwa, and Devin Rousso.

        The isMainThread() idiom is only meaningful for WebCore.  It is less meaningful
        for JSC since a VM instance can be entered from multiple threads, as long as only
        one thread enters it at any time.  Hence, the concept of a main thread doesn't
        make sense at the JSC level.

        Since r251036, we started using a WTF::String to represent the RunLoop mode.
        This caused problems for JSC clients when USE(CF) since it necessitated the use of
        StringWrapperCFAllocator to track the life cycle of the CFStringRef generated from
        the WTF::String.

        To fix this problem, we should restore the original behavior of using CFStringRefs
        as the RunLoop mode token.

        [JSC] DateMath should have TimeClipped version
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203550

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We found that our Date constructor is slow because GregorianDateTime calculation takes so long.
        We are doing many `fmod`, floating division, `floor` etc. These operations, in particular `fmod`, takes
        very long time. As a result, 30% of JetStream2/date-format-xparb is taken by `fmod` function.

        But since we are performance timeClip operation, double value in DateInstance is always Int52. We should
        have integer version of GregorianDateTime calculation which avoids many unnecessary fmod etc.

        While integer division is truncate-to-zero, many Date calculation requires `floor(value / xxx)`. For now,
        we use integer fast path only when the value is Int52 and positive.

        We see 10~ % improvement in JetStream2/date-format-xparb-SP (from 201 to 239).

        This warning arises because earlier code checks to see if oldHashtable
        is NULL, leading the static analyzer to think that it *could* be NULL.
        However, even earlier code actually ensures that oldHashtable will not
        be NULL. Address this by removing the NULL check, and back it up with
        an ASSERT to ensure that it's not NULL.

        This error is due to an earlier "if" statement that caused the static

        Even with that error fixed, the static analyzer will still infer that

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200620

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        This patch is second part of bug 200620 patch. I split I split it into three pieces to make roll-out easy.
        his part, we convert std::make_unique to WTF::makeUnique or WTF::makeUniqueWithoutFastMallocCheck.
        In the third patch, we will add a static_assert to makeUnique, which ensures the given class T is FastMalloced or IsoHeaped.

        This patch adds `WTF::makeUnique<T>` and `WTF::makeUniqueWithoutFastMallocCheck<T>` as drop-in replacement for `std::make_unique<T>`.
        `WTF::makeUnique<T>` has one additional `static_assert` check which ensures `T` FastMalloc / IsoHeap annotated. If it is not, the
        compile error happens.

        In this patch, I tried using this everywhere in WebKit as much as possible. And we found that surprisingly many classes are missing
        FastMalloc annotation and allocated from system-malloc. Using WTF::makeUnique enforces classes / structs to use FastMalloc.

        WTF::makeUniqueWithoutFastMallocCheck is offered for the corner cases. This is identical to std::make_unique. We use this for classes
        that are offered by non-WebKit code base, like, zlib. This clear name can make us easily find this allocation is intentionally done
        by system-malloc.

        We do not take the following direction, `WTF::makeUnique` automatically allocates FastMalloc even if FastMalloc annotation is not attached.
        Since default deleter is performing `delete` and this is not what we want for FastMalloced ones, we need to return
        std::unique_ptr<T, FastFreeDeleter> for T if T does not have FastMalloc-annotation. Automatically doing this sounds a bit dangerous.

            auto pointer = WTF::makeUnique<T>();
            // Super dangerous, but sometimes it is required...
            auto* rawPointer = pointer.release();
            // Passing rawPointer to somewhere, and
            delete rawPointer;

        The above one becomes invalid because pointer may start requiring non `delete` destroying function.
        In the above case, the correct way becomes the following.

            rawPointer->~T();
            fastFree(rawPointer);

        This looks non-intuitive. And having two ways to destroying objects (`delete` or the above one) can be error-prone.
        If we have WTF_MAKE_FAST_ALLOCATED for T, we do not need to care about this. "new" and "delete" operators are defined, and C++ way works.
        The simple invariant, "makeUnique just does `new` internally. And `delete` operator does `delete`. default deleter is just doing `delete`", is kept.

        While we need to annotate many classes with WTF_MAKE_FAST_ALLOCATED, it is one time cost when we add a class.
        And, by introducing `WTF::makeUnique<>`, we no longer forget adding this.

            makeUnique(...)
            static_assert(T is FastMalloced or IsoHeaped);
            return make_unique<T>(...)

        Now that there are no remaining multi-parameter or behavior changing overloads
        of StringBuilder::append(...), we can rename StringBuilder::flexibleAppend(...)
        to StringBuilder::append(...).
        
        This change leaves the existing single parameter overloads StringBuilder::append(...)
        for now, and since they have specify specific types, they will continue to be prefered
        in overload resolution. Once we have concluded the variadic StringBuilder::append(...)
        can provide the same performance as the single parameter variant, we can remove the
        single parameter variant.

        When we switch StringBuilder::append(...) to be based on the StringConcatenate/makeString flexibleAppend 
        implementation, if we don't change anything, the behavior of StringBuilder::append(UChar32) will go from 
        appending a character to appending a stringified number.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200507

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Add threading assertions to RefCounted to try and catch unsafe concurrent ref'ing / derefing of
        RefCounted objects from several threads. If you hit these new assertions, it likely means you either
        need to:
        1. Have your class subclass ThreadSafeRefCounted instead of RefCounted
        or
        2. Make sure your objects always gets ref'd / deref'd from the same thread.

        These assertions already found several thread safety bugs in our code base, which I fixed via
        dependency bugs.

        These assertions are currently enabled in WebKit (UIProcess, child processes and
        WebKitLegacy), they do not apply other JavascriptCore API clients.

        LogArgument is a utility for converting scalars into strings. It has a
        number of versions of a toString() method that is specialized for each
        type and converts the value to a string in a manner appropriate for
        that type. However, the versions of toString() for "long long" and
        "unsigned long long" are actually declared to take an "long" or
        "unsigned long" as a parameter. This difference leads to a 64-bit vs
        32-bit build error on 32-bit systems. Fix this by specifying
        correct/matching types.

        [WTF] Add DataMutex and MainThreadData wrappers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199831

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        This patch adds two new wrapper classes:

        DataMutex<T> stores an instance of T in a private member along with a
        mutex. In order to use its fields, users need to instantiate a
        DataMutex<T>::LockedWrapper instance in the stack. This class uses
        RAII to lock and unlock the mutex in construction and destruction
        respectively, and by using the arrow operator lets the user access T's
        members.

        This way, DataMutex<T> prevents most instances of accidental access to
        data fields that should only be read and modified in an atomic matter.

        Still, both the Lock and the LockHolder are exposed once the user has
        taken the lock so that special cases such as waiting for a condition
        variable or performing an early unlock are doable.

        MainThreadData<T> is another wrapper class, in this case for data
        fields that should only be accessed from the main thread. In this
        case, it works similar to a smart pointer, except that (1) there is no
        actual memory indirection, T is stored directly inside
        MainThreadData<T> and (2) attempts to use the -> or * operator have an
        isMainThread() assertion.

        Together, these two wrapper classes make it easier to write
        multi-threaded code in a safer, more self-documented way by letting
        the author group data into structures that have certain access safety
        requirements.

        These structures were originally part of the new GStreamer
        WebKitMediaSrc rework patch: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199719

        Add StringBuilder member function which allows makeString() style variadic argument construction
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198997

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Adds new StringBuilder::flexibleAppend(...) member function which allows passing one or more 
        string-adaptable (in the sense that there is StringTypeAdapter specialization for the 
        type) parameters. This re-ususes the variadic template infrastructure in StringConcatenate.h
        that is used for makeString(...) allowing for improvements in one to benefit the other.

        The advantage of StringBuilder::flexibleAppend(...) over calling StringBuilder::append(...)
        multiple times (beyond the code sharing with makeString(...) is that it can avoid unnecessary
        additional re-allocations when the StringBuilder needs to expand it's capacity. It does this
        by computing the complete required length for all the passed arguments and then ensuring enough
        capacity is available. It also reduces the allocation overhead versus the anti-pattern of
        builder.append(makeString(...)).

        Ideally, this member function should eventually just be called StringBuilder::append(...), but
        the current overload set for StringBuilder::append(...) makes this complicated due to overloads
        that take two arguments such as StringBuilder::append(const UChar*, unsigned). Going forward, we
        should rename or remove those overloads and move to a standard interface.

        Make sure to store T::WeakValueType* instead of T*, since they might
        not be the same pointer value. (In practice, T and T::WeakValueType*
        are always the same type in this constructor because WeakPtrFactory

        Previously, if Base and Derived both inherited CanMakeWeakPtr, and
        you casted WeakPtr<Base> to WeakPtr<Derived> (or vice versa), and
        casting Base <-> Derived required pointer fixup, the previous
        compile-time check would accept the cast, even though the stored pointer
        would be wrong.

        WeakPtr breaks vtables when upcasting to base classes

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197730

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch introduces a new data structures, WTF::Packed, WTF::PackedPtr, and WTF::PackedAlignedPtr.

        - WTF::Packed

            WTF::Packed is data storage. We can read and write trivial (in C++ term [1]) data to this storage. The difference to
            the usual storage is that the alignment of this storage is always 1. We access the underlying data by using unalignedLoad/unalignedStore.
            This class offers alignment = 1 data structure instead of missing the following characteristics.

                1. Load / Store are non atomic even if the data size is within a pointer width. We should not use this for a member which can be accessed
                   in a racy way. (e.g. fields accessed optimistically from the concurrent compilers).

                2. We cannot take reference / pointer to the underlying storage since they are unaligned.

                3. Access to this storage is unaligned access. The code is using memcpy, and the compiler will convert to an appropriate unaligned access
                   in certain architectures (x86_64 / ARM64). It could be slow. So use it for non performance sensitive & memory sensitive places.

        - WTF::PackedPtr

            WTF::PackedPtr is a specialization of WTF::Packed<T*>. And it is basically WTF::PackedAlignedPtr with alignment = 1. We further compact
            the pointer by leveraging the platform specific knowledge. In 64bit architectures, the effective width of pointers are less than 64 bit.
            In x86_64, it is 48 bits. And Darwin ARM64 is further smaller, 36 bits. This information allows us to compact the pointer to 6 bytes in
            x86_64 and 5 bytes in Darwin ARM64.

        - WTF::PackedAlignedPtr

            WTF::PackedAlignedPtr is the WTF::PackedPtr with alignment information of the T. If we use this alignment information, we could reduce the
            size of packed pointer further in some cases. For example, since we guarantee that JSCells are 16 byte aligned, low 4 bits are empty. Leveraging
            this information in Darwin ARM64 platform allows us to make packed JSCell pointer 4 bytes (36 - 4 bits). We do not use passed alignment
            information if it is not profitable.

        We also have PackedPtrTraits. This is new PtrTraits and use it for various data structures such as Bag<>.

        [GLib] Rework WPE RunLoopSourcePriority values
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197167

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        The GLib priorities for the WPE port were initially aligned on the -70
        value, theory being that this would help avoid any default-priority
        GSources spawned in different dependency libraries affecting our
        scheduling. Today it seems that extra caution might not be really
        necessary.

        This change aligns the base priority value with GLib's default priority
        value of 0. We maintain the relativity of priority values by effectively
        increasing each priority by 70.

        Remove Gigacage from arm64 and use PAC for arm64e instead
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197110

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch changes the Gigacage to use PAC on arm64e. As part of
        this process all platforms must provide their length when
        materializing the caged pointer. Since it would be somewhat
        confusing to have two parameters for an operator [] those methods
        have been removed. Lastly, this patch removes the specializations
        for void* caged pointers, instead opting to use enable_if on the
        methods that would normally fail on void* e.g. anything that
        returns a T&.

        Reviewed by Konstantin Tokarev.

        If unified builds are disabled, the ruby script to generate them
        is still used to list the sources that need to be
        compiled. Currently, the script always generates bundled unified
        sources, even if it's being used just to list all the sources. So
        when the unified builds are disabled and no files are going to be
        bundled, the script generates one empty file per bundle manager
        (that is, one C++ and one ObjectiveC), that gets added to the
        sources to be compiled.

        * Scripts/generate-unified-source-bundles.rb: Only go through the

        [WPE] Avoid async IO starving timers

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        If AsyncIONetwork and DiskCacheRead priorities are higher than
        MainThreadSharedTimer the timers get starved. This causes the NetworkProcess
        to accumulate MB of data instead of handing it down to the WebProcess (done
        using a Timer). This eventually causes an Out Of Memory kill on the
        NetworkProcess on some embedded platforms with low memory limits.

        This patch levels the three priorities to the same value, while still leaving
        DiskCacheWrite with less priority than DiskCacheRead.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195991

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Previously, our backwards graph analysis was slightly wrong. The idea of
        backwards graph is that the root of the graph has edges to terminals in
        the original graph. And then the original directed edges in the graph are flipped.
        
        However, we weren't considering loops as a form of terminality. For example,
        we wouldn't consider an infinite loop as a terminal. So there were no edges
        from the root to a node in the infinite loop. This lead us to make mistakes
        when we used backwards dominators to compute control flow equivalence.
        
        This is better understood in an example:
        
        ```
        preheader:
        while (1) {
            if (!isCell(v))
                continue;
            load structure ID
            if (cond)
               continue;
            return
        }
        ```
        
        In the previous version of this algorithm, the only edge from the backwards
        root would be to the block containing the return. This would lead us to
        believe that the loading of the structureID backwards dominates the preheader,
        leading us to believe it's control flow equivalent to preheader. This is
        obviously wrong, since we can loop forever if "v" isn't a cell.
        
        The solution here is to treat any backedge in the graph as a "terminal" node.
        Since a backedge implies the existence of a loop.
        
        In the above example, the backwards root now has an edge to both blocks with
        "continue". This prevents us from falsely claiming that the return is control
        flow equivalent with the preheader.
        
        This patch uses DFS spanning trees to compute back edges. An edge
        u->v is a back edge when u is a descendent of v in the DFS spanning
        tree of the Graph.

        Before performing any logging, the NetworkProcess checks to see if
        it's performing an operation associated with a private (ephemeral)
        browsing session. If so, it skips the logging. However, networking
        layers below the NetworkProcess don't know about private browsing, so
        they would still perform their own logging. CFNetwork now has a flag
        that lets us control that, so set it to False if private browsing.

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Enable building with Thin LTO in Production when using Xcode 10.2 or
        later. This change results in a 1.45% progression in PLT5. Full
        Production build times increase about 2-3%. Incremental build times
        are more severely affected, and so LTO is not enabled for local
        engineering builds.

        LTO is enabled only on macOS for now, until rdar://problem/49013399,
        which affects ARM builds, is fixed.

        To change the LTO setting when building locally:

        - If building with `make`, specify WK_LTO_MODE={none,thin,full} on the
          command line.
        - If building with `build-webkit`, specify --lto-mode={none,thin,full}
          on the command line.
        - If building with `build-root`, specify --lto={none,thin,full} on the
          command line.
        - If building with Xcode, create a LocalOverrides.xcconfig file at the
          top level of your repository directory (if needed) and define
          WK_LTO_MODE to full, thin, or none.

        Additionally, -Wclass-memaccess has been enhanced to catch a few cases that GCC 8 didn't.

        a string of size MaxLength+1 always fails. This means that expanding
        a StringBuilder only worked when the newly doubled capacity is less or
        equal to MaxLength.

        Specify fixed precision explicitly to prepare to change String::number and StringBuilder::appendNumber floating point behavior
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195533

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Soon, we will change String::number and StringBuilder::appendNumber for floating
        point to use "shortest form" serialization instead of the current default, which is
        "6-digit fixed precision stripping trailing zeros". To prepare to do this safely
        without accidentally changing any behavior, changing callers to call the explicit
        versions. Later, we may want to return and change many of them to use shortest form
        instead, but that may require rebaselining tests, and in some extreme cases, getting
        rid of flawed logic that converts between different single and double precision
        floating point; such problems may be hidden by fixed precision serialization.

        Since "shortest form" is already the behavior for AtomicString::number and
        for makeString, no changes required for clients of either of those.

        Add WeakHashSet
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195152

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Added WeakHashSet which is a HashSet of WeakPtr. When the object pointed by WeakPtr is deleted,
        WeakHashSet treats the key to be no longer in the set. That is, WeakHashSet::contains returns false
        and const_iterator skips such a WeakPtr in the set.

        We decided not to make HashSet<WeahPtr<T>> work because it involves weird semantics such as making
        find(X) delete the table entry as remove(find(X)) would be a no-op otherwise as find(X) would return
        necessarily need to return HashSet<WeakPtr<T>>::end().

        Furthermore, we cannot determine the true size of this set in O(1) because the objected pointed by
        some of WeakPtr in the set may have already been deleted. This has implications that we can't have
        size(), isEmpty(), random(), etc... as O(1) operation.

        WeakHashSet is implemented as HashSet<WeakReference<T>>. HashTable::rehash has been updated to delete
        WeakReference<T>'s whose m_ptr has become null, and HashTable::expand first deletes any such entry
        before deciding an actual expansion is needed. This is accomplished via newly added hash trait,
        hasIsReleasedWeakValueFunction, and HashTraits<Ref<WeakReference<T>>>::isReleasedWeakValue which
        returns true for when WeakReference<T> pointed by Ref<WeakReference<T>> has null m_ptr, not to be
        confused with Ref<WeakReference<T>> itself pointing to a null WeakReference<T>.

        This patch removes the instantiation of Poisoned variants of the various containers
        but retains the ability of those containers to work with pointer traits.  This
        allows us to use them with smart pointers in the future (just like we used to with
        Poisoned values).  At minimum, this ability will be useful when we want to insert
        an observer into the container storage type for debugging purposes, or to collect
        statistics for profiling.

        Update double-conversion to the latest version
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194994

        Import the latest version of the double-conversion library based on
        https://github.com/google/double-conversion/commit/990c44707c70832dc1ce1578048c2198bafd3307

        In additon to importing the code, the following changes were applied (or re-applied) to maintain 
        parity with what we had previously:
             - Add #include "config.h" to each cpp file.
             - Put everything inside the WTF namespace.
             - Changed all in library includes to be of the form #include <wtf/dtoa/FILE.h>.
             - Renamed double_conversion::Vector<> to double_conversion::BufferReference<>.
             - Replaced duplicated functions with ASCIICType.h variants
             - Made CachedPower table a constexpr.
             - Exported (via WTF_EXPORT_PRIVATE) several functions in double-conversion.h.
             - Made substantial changes to StringToDoubleConverter to avoid unnecessary overhead of 
               parameterization, as we only ever want one configuration. Instead of constructing a
               configured class and calling StringToDouble on it, StringToDouble is now a static
               function. This allows a bunch of now dead code (hex support, octal support, etc.) to
               be eliminated. As StringToDoubleConverter now supports single precision floats, some
               additional templating of StringToIeee was added to avoid extra unnecessary branching.
             - Added RemoveCharacters function to double_conversion::StringBuilder.

        Fix deadlock on Linux/x64 between SamplingProfiler and VMTraps
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194014

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Do not block SIGUSR1 when installing signal handlers, since this signal
        is used to suspend/resume machine threads on Linux.

        ftl-ai-filter-phantoms-should-clear-clear-value.js deadlocked with
        enabled watchdog and sampling.

        Deadlock happened in the following situation:

        Thread 1 (Sampling): SamplingProfiler.cpp:takeSample takes all needed locks
        and then tries to suspend the main thread.

        Thread 2 (Watchdog/VMTraps): Before the Sampling-Thread suspends the main thread
        a signal is caught and the signal handler is invoked (VMTraps.cpp:SignalSender).
        SignalSender tries to lock codeBlockSet, but this is already locked by the
        SamplingProfiler.

        The SamplingProfiler can only give up the lock when it suspends
        the thread. However since the VMTraps signal handler is active, all other signals blocked,
        therefore the SamplingProfiler also waits until its signal handler is invoked.

        This patch fixes this by not blocking SIGUSR1 in installSignalHandler, since
        it is used to suspend/resume threads on Linux.

        clampTo(): do not convert the input to double when dealing with integers

        <rdar://problem/47692312>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Previously, every use of clampTo() was converting the input to double,
        doing the comparison in double, then casting back to whatever type was needed.

        In many case, that was very wasteful. WebKit has many cases of clampTo() with

        Bug 193790 add a facility for checking -- during build time -- that
        any needed .xcfilelist files are up-to-date and for updating them if
        they are not. This facility was initially opt-in by setting
        WK_ENABLE_CHECK_XCFILELISTS until other pieces were in place and until
        the process seemed robust. Its now time to enable this facility and
        make it opt-out. If there is a need to disable this facility, set and
        export WK_DISABLE_CHECK_XCFILELISTS=1 in your environment before
        running `make` or `build-webkit`, or before running Xcode from the

        [GLib] Stop URI-escaping file system representations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194213

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Stop URI-escaping of file representation strings in
        FileSystem::stringFromFileSystemRepresentation(), and URI-unescaping
        of strings in FileSystem::fileSystemRepresentation().

        This behavior deviates from POSIX and CF implementations and is
        currently breaking IndexedDB-specific calculation of database sizes due
        to directory components used in that process that are URL-based and are
        as such URI-escaped. When unescaped, those single directory components
        explode into multiple directory components, leading to incorrect total
        database size calculation when iterating the database directory.

        FileSystem::stringFromFileSystemRepresentation() now retrieves GLib's
        filename charsets and in worst case converts the filesystem
        representation to UTF-8 before String::fromUTF8() is used.
        FileSystem::fileSystemRepresentation() reverses that process, taking
        String's UTF-8 data and converting it to target charset if necessary.

        Other FileSystem functions are adjusted to convert passed-in String
        objects to filesystem representations.

        The non COCOA version of WorkQueue::concurrentApply() creates a temporary

        the raw char pointer to internally initialize the thread.

        Reviewed by Don Olmstead.

        Unified Source Builds are using global sequential numbers for
        bundle filenames UnifiedSource{sequential-number}.cpp. As the
        result, every new source file added would shift the next ones and
        prevent compiler caches from speeding up consecutive builds e.g.
        in git-bisect sessions.

        Changed it to directory local sequential numbers,
        UnifiedSource-{hash-of-dir-name}-{sequential-number-within-the-dir}.cpp.

        This is affecting only CMake builds which is where no
        '--max-cpp-bundle-count' nor '--max-obj-c-bundle-count' options
        are set. Xcode builds still use the old convention.

        [GLib] RunLoop::dispatchAfter() GSource requires microsecond precision
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192696

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        The GSource we set up in GLib's RunLoop::dispatchAfter() implementation
        should support microsecond-precision delays. Such delays are common in
        JSC's Watchdog implementation and missing support for them has been
        causing test failures in the `testapi` program as well as some JSC
        tests that depend on the termination determination functionality of the
        JSC::Watchdog class.

        RunLoop::dispatchAfter() is changed to spawn a raw GSource that uses the
        existing GSourceFuncs implementation used elsewhere in GLib's RunLoop.
        The GSource's ready time is set manually, now with the necessary
        microsecond precision.

        CRASH() should call abort() except on Darwin and in developer builds, as discussed on

        Currently, SOFT_LINK_CLASS_FOR_HEADER declares a class getter function that includes the

        Including the framework name in the getter is unnecessary. Objective-C classes already exist
        in a global namespace, so there is no need to disambiguate class names by framework. This
        patch elides the framework name from the getter function. For example, NSView would now have

        Add raw pointer overloads to ListHashSet via SmartPtr specialized functions

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Adds overloads for find, contains, insertBefore and remove that take raw pointers
        when the value type V of a ListHashSet is true for the predicate IsSmartPtr<V>::value.
        This brings the interface to ListHashSet closer inline with HashSet, HashMap and HashCountedSet
        which already have this functionality. Like in the other collections, this is especially
        useful when using std::unique_ptr<> as the value, since there would be no way to pass it
        to these functions. One difference between this set of overloads is the inclusion of insertBefore,
        which is unique to ListHashSet. As would be expected, this specialization only changes the first
        parameter, the one that needs to be found, to support a raw pointer.

        Enhanced StringBuilder::toString() to skip the shrinkToFit(), reifyString(), and
        the hasOverflowed() check if m_string is not null.  When m_string is not null,
        the StringBuilder either only has a single String in m_string (with m_buffer being 
        null), or reifyString() has already been called (resulting in a non-null m_string
        with a possibly non-null m_buffer).

        We can skip the overflow check because:
        1. if the StringBuilder only has a single String, then there cannot be an overflow.
        2. if reifyString() has already been called, then the hasOverflowed() checked has
           already been done because every code path that calls reifyString() first does
           the hasOverflowed() check.

        We can skip shrinkToFit() because it only applies to m_buffer.
        1. if the StringBuilder only has a single String, then there's no m_buffer to shrink.
        2. if reifyString() has already been called, then we either came down
           a. the toString() path with a null m_string previously, where we would have
              already called shrinkToFit() before reifyString(), or
           b. the toStringPreserveCapacity() path where we don't want to shrinkToFit().

        We can skip reifyString() because:
        1. if the StringBuilder only has a single String, then the string is already reified.
        2. if reifyString() has been already called, then the string is already reified.

        Note that if m_string is the null string and m_buffer is null, reifyString() will
        replace it with the empty string.  For this reason, we cannot solely check for
        !m_buffer because we need to reify the null string into the empty string.

        Note also that if m_string is null and m_buffer is non-null, reifyString() will
        create a String and set m_string to it.  However, m_buffer remains non-null.
        For this reason, we cannot assert !m_buffer alone when m_string is non-null.
        We add a m_isReified flag (only when assertions are enabled) to track the reified
        case where both m_buffer and m_string are non-null.

        1. Enhanced StringBuilder so that it supports 2 modes of behavior:
           a. StringBuilder::OverflowHandler::CrashOnOverflow.
           b. StringBuilder::OverflowHandler::RecordOverflow.

           CrashOnOverflow will crash the moment an overflow or failure to allocate
           memory is detected.

           RecordOverflow will make StringBuilder::hasOverflowed() return true when an
           overflow or failure to allocate memory is detected.  However, if the user
           invokes toString(), toStringPreserveCapacity(), toAtomicString(), length(),
           capacity(), isEmpty(), characters8(), or characters16(), then the StringBuilder
           will crash regardless because these methods can only meaningfully do their
           work and return a result if and only if the builder has not overflowed.

           By default, the StringBuilder crashes on overflow (the old behavior) unless it
           is explicitly constructed with the StringBuilder::OverflowHandler::RecordOverflow
           enum.

           Design note:

           The StringBuilder can only be put in 1 of the 2 modes at the time of
           construction.  This means that we could have implemented it as a template
           that is parameterized on an OverflowHandler class (like CheckedArithmetic)
           instead of using a runtime check in the ConditionalCrashOnOverflow handler.

           However, I was not able to get clang to export the explicitly instantiated
           instances (despite the methods having being decorated with WTF_EXPORT_PRIVATE).
           Since the StringBuilder is a transient object (not stored for a long time on
           the heap), and the runtime check of the boolean is not that costly compared
           to other work that StringBuilder routinely does (e.g. memcpy), using the
           new ConditionalCrashOnOverflow (which does a runtime check to determine to
           crash or not on overflow) is fine.

           When clang is able to export explicitly instantiated template methods, we can
           templatize StringBuilder and do away with ConditionalCrashOnOverflow.
           See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191050.

           FastMalloc, and bmalloc (and related peers) to enable this.

           like CrashOnOverflow or RecordOverflow.

        In some cases, remove(begin()) is not quite good enough as a random
        eviction strategy. (See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190792.)
        So, let's support real random eviction.

        makeIterator() already supports starting from any bucket, so this is
        pretty easy.

        In the subtle case where we select end(), we choose to wrap around and
        return begin(). We expect that clients don't really think of the end()
        bucket as being in the domain of the random search. Also, we don't want
        to annoy clients who know their tables are non-empty with needless

        Add symbol information to stack traces using dbghelp.dll
        This library will use symbols files from these sources:
            - The current working directory
            - The directory containing the application's executable
            - _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable

        This functionality is currently only enabled in debug mode since dbghelp is not threadsafe.
        The DbgHelper class attempts to synchronize calls to dbghelp.dll but external code
        can still attempt to call the library at the same time as WebKit.

        StringTypeAdapter constructor is not properly enforcing String::MaxLength.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190392
        <rdar://problem/45116210>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Previously, the StringTypeAdapter constructor for a UChar* string was summing the
        unsigned length of the source string without an overflow check.  We now make that
        length a size_t which removes this issue, and assert that it's within
        String::MaxLength thereafter.

        Also made the StringTypeAdapter constructor for a LChar* string behave in an
        equivalent manner for consistency.  In both cases, we'll crash in a RELEASE_ASSERT
        if the source string length exceeds String::MaxLength.

        [WTF] Make isMainThread more reliable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189880

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        isMainThread() relied on Thread::current(). This API becomes broken in Windows
        when the Thread is about to be destroyed since TLS is already cleared. This causes
        a bug since `isMainThread()` is called in Thread::didExit in Windows.

        This patch makes this `isMainThread` more reliable in all the platforms. In Windows,
        we use `Thread::currentID()` instead of `Thread::current()` since `Thread::currentID`
        uses Win32 GetCurrentThreadId directly. In the other system, we use `pthread_main_np`
        or `pthread_self` instead.

        We also move `holdLock` code inside `if (shouldRemoveThreadFromThreadGroup())`. If
        the other thread takes a mutex and destroyed, this `holdLock` waits forever. This problem
        only happens in Windows since Windows calls TLS destructor for the main thread.

        Templated functions should take r-value references, as they have perfect type deduction for
        all parameter types; references, l-value references, and r-value references in template function
        parameters have special type deduction semantics.
        See: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference#Forwarding_references>

        Previously, const reference parameters would be copied when passed into anyOf(), and containers
        of Ref<> would generate compile errors when passed into anyOf, as they cannot be copied. Now,
        with r-value reference types in template parameters, a const reference is mapped to a const reference,
        a non-const reference is mapped to a non-const reference, and a r-value reference is mapped to
        an r-value reference.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Clang for Windows build enables WTF_COMPILER_CLANG and
        WTF_COMPILER_MSVC, but disables WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG. It is
        strange WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG is not enabled even though
        WTF_COMPILER_CLANG is enabled. However, Clang for Windows imitates
        MSVC, and codes for COMPILER(GCC_OR_CLANG) are for non MSVC. At
        least at the moment, it is not feasible to define
        WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG for Clang for Windows.

        To solve the issue, this change renames WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG
        to WTF_COMPILER_GCC_COMPATIBLE.

        As an exception, I'd like to use IGNORE_WARNINGS_* macros even in
