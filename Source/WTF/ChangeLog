        CRASH() should call abort() except on Darwin and in developer builds
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184408

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        CRASH() should call abort() except on Darwin and in developer builds, as discussed on
        webkit-dev. This should be slightly nicer than dereferencing 0xbadbeef.

        On Darwin, CRASH() uses a breakpoint trap, which seems to corrupt the stack on Linux, so we
        can't do that.

        Continue to call WTFCrash() in developer mode, and make no changes to WTFCrash(), since it
        is reportedly useful in nightmare scenarios where core dumps are unavailable.

        We also have to define CRASH_UNDER_CONSTEXPR_CONTEXT(). It's a bit odd that it's possible to
        use a non-constexpr function here, but it works. Currently this macro uses WTFCrash(), which

        [Cocoa] SOFT_LINK_CLASS_FOR_{HEADER,SOURCE} should generate a more concise getter function
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191899

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Currently, SOFT_LINK_CLASS_FOR_HEADER declares a class getter function that includes the
        framework name. For example, NSView would have a class getter named
        namespace::get_AppKit_NSViewClass().

        Including the framework name in the getter is unnecessary. Objective-C classes already exist
        in a global namespace, so there is no need to disambiguate class names by framework. This
        patch elides the framework name from the getter function. For example, NSView would now have
        a getter named namespace::getNSViewClass().

        Add raw pointer overloads to ListHashSet via SmartPtr specialized functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191936

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Adds overloads for find, contains, insertBefore and remove that take raw pointers
        when the value type V of a ListHashSet is true for the predicate IsSmartPtr<V>::value.
        This brings the interface to ListHashSet closer inline with HashSet, HashMap and HashCountedSet
        which already have this functionality. Like in the other collections, this is especially
        useful when using std::unique_ptr<> as the value, since there would be no way to pass it
        to these functions. One difference between this set of overloads is the inclusion of insertBefore,
        which is unique to ListHashSet. As would be expected, this specialization only changes the first
        parameter, the one that needs to be found, to support a raw pointer.

        Enhanced StringBuilder::toString() to skip the shrinkToFit(), reifyString(), and
        the hasOverflowed() check if m_string is not null.  When m_string is not null,
        the StringBuilder either only has a single String in m_string (with m_buffer being 
        null), or reifyString() has already been called (resulting in a non-null m_string
        with a possibly non-null m_buffer).

        We can skip the overflow check because:
        1. if the StringBuilder only has a single String, then there cannot be an overflow.
        2. if reifyString() has already been called, then the hasOverflowed() checked has
           already been done because every code path that calls reifyString() first does
           the hasOverflowed() check.

        We can skip shrinkToFit() because it only applies to m_buffer.
        1. if the StringBuilder only has a single String, then there's no m_buffer to shrink.
        2. if reifyString() has already been called, then we either came down
           a. the toString() path with a null m_string previously, where we would have
              already called shrinkToFit() before reifyString(), or
           b. the toStringPreserveCapacity() path where we don't want to shrinkToFit().

        We can skip reifyString() because:
        1. if the StringBuilder only has a single String, then the string is already reified.
        2. if reifyString() has been already called, then the string is already reified.

        Note that if m_string is the null string and m_buffer is null, reifyString() will
        replace it with the empty string.  For this reason, we cannot solely check for
        !m_buffer because we need to reify the null string into the empty string.

        Note also that if m_string is null and m_buffer is non-null, reifyString() will
        create a String and set m_string to it.  However, m_buffer remains non-null.
        For this reason, we cannot assert !m_buffer alone when m_string is non-null.
        We add a m_isReified flag (only when assertions are enabled) to track the reified
        case where both m_buffer and m_string are non-null.

        1. Enhanced StringBuilder so that it supports 2 modes of behavior:
           a. StringBuilder::OverflowHandler::CrashOnOverflow.
           b. StringBuilder::OverflowHandler::RecordOverflow.

           CrashOnOverflow will crash the moment an overflow or failure to allocate
           memory is detected.

           RecordOverflow will make StringBuilder::hasOverflowed() return true when an
           overflow or failure to allocate memory is detected.  However, if the user
           invokes toString(), toStringPreserveCapacity(), toAtomicString(), length(),
           capacity(), isEmpty(), characters8(), or characters16(), then the StringBuilder
           will crash regardless because these methods can only meaningfully do their
           work and return a result if and only if the builder has not overflowed.

           By default, the StringBuilder crashes on overflow (the old behavior) unless it
           is explicitly constructed with the StringBuilder::OverflowHandler::RecordOverflow
           enum.

           Design note:

           The StringBuilder can only be put in 1 of the 2 modes at the time of
           construction.  This means that we could have implemented it as a template
           that is parameterized on an OverflowHandler class (like CheckedArithmetic)
           instead of using a runtime check in the ConditionalCrashOnOverflow handler.

           However, I was not able to get clang to export the explicitly instantiated
           instances (despite the methods having being decorated with WTF_EXPORT_PRIVATE).
           Since the StringBuilder is a transient object (not stored for a long time on
           the heap), and the runtime check of the boolean is not that costly compared
           to other work that StringBuilder routinely does (e.g. memcpy), using the
           new ConditionalCrashOnOverflow (which does a runtime check to determine to
           crash or not on overflow) is fine.

           When clang is able to export explicitly instantiated template methods, we can
           templatize StringBuilder and do away with ConditionalCrashOnOverflow.
           See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191050.

        To support the above, we also did:

        2. Enhanced all StringBuilder append and buffer allocation methods to be able to
           fail without crashing.  This also meant that ...

        3. Added tryReallocate() support to StringImpl.  tryRealloc() was added to
           FastMalloc, and bmalloc (and related peers) to enable this.

        4. Added ConditionalCrashOnOverflow, which can choose at runtime whether to behave
           like CrashOnOverflow or RecordOverflow.

        In some cases, remove(begin()) is not quite good enough as a random
        eviction strategy. (See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190792.)
        So, let's support real random eviction.

        makeIterator() already supports starting from any bucket, so this is
        pretty easy.

        In the subtle case where we select end(), we choose to wrap around and
        return begin(). We expect that clients don't really think of the end()
        bucket as being in the domain of the random search. Also, we don't want
        to annoy clients who know their tables are non-empty with needless
        checks for end().

        Add symbol information to stack traces using dbghelp.dll
        This library will use symbols files from these sources:
            - The current working directory
            - The directory containing the application's executable
            - _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable
            - _NT_ALTERNATE_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable

        This functionality is currently only enabled in debug mode since dbghelp is not threadsafe.
        The DbgHelper class attempts to synchronize calls to dbghelp.dll but external code
        can still attempt to call the library at the same time as WebKit.

        StringTypeAdapter constructor is not properly enforcing String::MaxLength.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190392
        <rdar://problem/45116210>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Previously, the StringTypeAdapter constructor for a UChar* string was summing the
        unsigned length of the source string without an overflow check.  We now make that
        length a size_t which removes this issue, and assert that it's within
        String::MaxLength thereafter.

        Also made the StringTypeAdapter constructor for a LChar* string behave in an
        equivalent manner for consistency.  In both cases, we'll crash in a RELEASE_ASSERT
        if the source string length exceeds String::MaxLength.

        [WTF] Make isMainThread more reliable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189880

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        isMainThread() relied on Thread::current(). This API becomes broken in Windows
        when the Thread is about to be destroyed since TLS is already cleared. This causes
        a bug since `isMainThread()` is called in Thread::didExit in Windows.

        This patch makes this `isMainThread` more reliable in all the platforms. In Windows,
        we use `Thread::currentID()` instead of `Thread::current()` since `Thread::currentID`
        uses Win32 GetCurrentThreadId directly. In the other system, we use `pthread_main_np`
        or `pthread_self` instead.

        We also move `holdLock` code inside `if (shouldRemoveThreadFromThreadGroup())`. If
        the other thread takes a mutex and destroyed, this `holdLock` waits forever. This problem
        only happens in Windows since Windows calls TLS destructor for the main thread.

        Templated functions should take r-value references, as they have perfect type deduction for
        all parameter types; references, l-value references, and r-value references in template function
        parameters have special type deduction semantics.
        See: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference#Forwarding_references>

        Previously, const reference parameters would be copied when passed into anyOf(), and containers
        of Ref<> would generate compile errors when passed into anyOf, as they cannot be copied. Now,
        with r-value reference types in template parameters, a const reference is mapped to a const reference,
        a non-const reference is mapped to a non-const reference, and a r-value reference is mapped to
        an r-value reference.

        Rename WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG to WTF_COMPILER_GCC_COMPATIBLE
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189733

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Clang for Windows build enables WTF_COMPILER_CLANG and
        WTF_COMPILER_MSVC, but disables WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG. It is
        strange WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG is not enabled even though
        WTF_COMPILER_CLANG is enabled. However, Clang for Windows imitates
        MSVC, and codes for COMPILER(GCC_OR_CLANG) are for non MSVC. At
        least at the moment, it is not feasible to define
        WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG for Clang for Windows.

        To solve the issue, this change renames WTF_COMPILER_GCC_OR_CLANG
        to WTF_COMPILER_GCC_COMPATIBLE.

        As an exception, I'd like to use IGNORE_WARNINGS_* macros even in
        Clang for Windows builds.

        [JSC] Enable LLInt ASM interpreter on X64 and ARM64 in non JIT configuration
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189778

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        This patch adds ENABLE(C_LOOP) which indicates we use CLoop as the interpreter.
        Previously, we used !ENABLE(JIT) for this configuration. But now, we have
        a build configuration that has LLInt ASM interpreter (not CLoop) and !ENABLE(JIT).

        We enable LLInt ASM interpreter for non JIT environment in X86_64 and ARM64 architectures.
        And we enable ENABLE(ASSEMBLER) for non JIT environment since it offers machine register
        information which is used for LLInt and SamplingProfiler.
