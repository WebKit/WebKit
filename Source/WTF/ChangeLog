        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        There is an inherent race in Condition::waitFor() where the timeout can happen just before
        a notify from another thread.

        Fixed this by adding a condition variable and flag to each AutomaticThread.  The flag
        is used to signify to a notifying thread that the thread is waiting.  That flag is set
        in the waiting thread before calling waitFor() and cleared by another thread when it
        notifies the thread.  The access to that flag happens when the lock is held.
        Now the waiting thread checks if the flag after a timeout to see that it in fact should
        proceed like a normal notification.

        The added condition variable allows us to target a specific thread.  We used to keep a list
        of waiting threads, now we keep a list of all threads.  To notify one thread, we look for
        a waiting thread and notify it directly.  If we can't find a waiting thread, we start a
        sleeping thread.

        We notify all threads by waking all waiting threads and starting all sleeping threads.

        Stop reinterpret_casting UBreakIterators to the undefined type TextBreakIterator
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165931

        We have a class declaration for TextBreakIterator but no definition for it. When we
        create an ICU UBreakIterator, we immediately reinterpret_cast it to this undefined
        type, and pass it around our code inside WebCore. Then, whenever we want to actually
        use this iterator, we reinterpret_cast it back to UBreakIterator. This is likely due
        to some ports historically implementing breaking interators on top of other libraries
        other than ICU; however, now, all ports use ICU. Because this internal type is not
        helpful and just adds confusion, we should just call our breaking iterators what
        they are: UBreakIterators.

        This patch is a mechanical replacement of TextBreakIterator to UBreakIterator and
        removes the functions we were calling which pass through directly to ubrk_*().

        Kraken json-stringify-tinderbox performance heavily relies on StringBuilder::appendQuotedJSONString.
        According to the result produced by Linux `perf`, it occupies 28% of execution time.

        And add " and \ cases (since including " in the string is common). Then we fallback to the slow case.

        improve the code later.

        Notable, for my WebAssembly patch I also taught the code to handle
        integers and other types (including WebAssembly types). A

        To find this bug, I needed to seriously beef up our logging infrastructure.
        
        It's now the case that:
        
            dataLog(...);
        
        will print its output atomically. This happens with some careful magic:
        
        - dataFile() is now a LockedPrintStream that locks around print().
        
        - The lock is a recursive lock via RecursiveLockAdapter<>, so if the dump methods end
          up calling back into dataLog() then it just works. This is important: say the dump()
          calls a getter that itself does logging, maybe because it's encountering badness and
          wants to report it before crashing).
        
        - The lock is a WordLock so that ParkingLot and Lock can keep using dataLog() for
          debugging. We probably won't need to debug WordLock anytime soon - the algorithm is
          so simple.
        
        - LockedPrintStream::print(...) causes the print callbacks of its arguments to run on
          the underlying PrintStream, so that you don't need to do recursive lock acquisition
          on each individual argument and whatever printing it does recursively.

        Instead of having to say:
        
        Locker<LockType> locker(locks of type LockType)
        
        I think that we should use "auto locker = holdLock(lock)" as the default way that we acquire
        locks unless we need to use a special locker type.
        
        This also adds the ability to safepoint a lock. Safepointing a lock is basically a super fast
        way of unlocking it fairly and then immediately relocking it - i.e. letting anyone who is

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch moves SymbolImpl initialization from StringImpl to SymbolImpl.
        In SymbolImpl, we create the appropriate fields. At that time, these fields
        should be aligned to the BufferSubstring StringImpl.

        And we newly create the `m_flags` in SymbolImpl. Instead of using special
        StringImpl::null(), we store s_flagIsNullSymbol flag here. In WTF, we have
        the invariant that StringImpl::empty() is the only atomic empty string.
        But StringImpl::null() breaks this invariant. Using a special flag is safer
        way to represent the null Symbol `Symbol()`.

        Introduce StringImpl::StaticStringImpl with constexpr constructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165093

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch adds new class, StringImpl::StaticStringImpl.
        By using this class, we can easily create static StringImpls.
        This class has constexpr constructor. You can initialize instances
        of this class as global static variables without invoking global
        constructors.

        We already have similar system, StaticASCIILiteral. But using it
        requires some special perl script since we need to calculate
        hash value. On the other hand, we can use StaticStringImpl without
        any script supports since we implement constexpr hash function.
        In the future, we will replace all the use of StaticASCIILiteral
        with this StaticStringImpl.

        We define empty / null strings as StaticStringImpl. And we make
        StringImpl::empty() & StringImpl::null() inline functions.

        [WTF] Import std::optional reference implementation as WTF::Optional
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164199

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Sam Weinig.

        Import std::optional reference implementation offered by the C++17
        original proposal paper. It has the same interface and functionality
        to the C++17's one. Previous WTF::Optional lacks several functionalities.
        The largest one is the correct constexpr constructors. This fact prevents
        us from using Optional<literal type> in constexpr context in WebKit.

        In WebKit, we do not allow global constructors. So only the constexpr
        constructor is the way to use WTF::Optional in the static const
        global variables. WTF::Optional is used in DOMJIT::Effect and
        we would like to emit static const global variables that includes
        this DOMJIT::Effect. That is the main motivation of this work.
        This functionality allows the IDL code generator to emit DOMJIT
        signatures as static const global variables.

        We import the reference implementation one instead of LLVM libc++'s one.
        This is because LLVM libc++'s one depends on many macro and type_traits
        offered by libc++ implementation. And adopting it to WebKit requires
        large modification compared to this reference implementation one.
        Furthermore, it is difficult to compile libc++'s optional in old GCC and VC++.
        It also requires some more modifications. To keep the thing simple,
        we import the reference implementation one now. Once C++17 is released
        and we update the compiler baseline, we can smoothly switch to the standard
        library's std::optional.

        We also add support for the environment that does not use exceptions to this
        reference implementation.

        And we also add valueOrCompute helper function. That keeps the extended
        functionality that previous WTF::Optional has.

        The reason why I went to such great pains to make WTF::Lock fit in two bits is that I
        knew that I would eventually need to stuff one into some miscellaneous bits of the
        JSCell header. That time has come, because the concurrent GC has numerous race
        conditions in visitChildren that can be trivially fixed if each object just has an
        internal lock. Some cell types might use it to simply protect their entire visitChildren
        function and anything that mutates the fields it touches, while other cell types might
        use it as a "lock of last resort" to handle corner cases of an otherwise wait-free or
        lock-free algorithm. Right now, it's used to protect certain transformations involving
        indexing storage.
        
        To make this happen, I factored the WTF::Lock algorithm into a LockAlgorithm struct that
        is templatized on lock type (uint8_t for WTF::Lock), the isHeldBit value (1 for
        WTF::Lock), and the hasParkedBit value (2 for WTF::Lock). This could have been done as
        a templatized Lock class that basically contains Atomic<LockType>. You could then make
        any field into a lock by bitwise_casting it to TemplateLock<field type, bit1, bit2>. But
        this felt too dirty, so instead, LockAlgorithm has static methods that take
        Atomic<LockType>& as their first argument. I think that this makes it more natural to
        project a LockAlgorithm onto an existing Atomic<> field. Sadly, some places have to cast
        their non-Atomic<> field to Atomic<> in order for this to work. Like so many other things
        we do, this just shows that the C++ style of labeling fields that are subject to atomic
        ops as atomic is counterproductive. Maybe some day I'll change LockAlgorithm to use our
        other Atomics API, which does not require Atomic<>.
        
        WTF::Lock now uses LockAlgorithm. The slow paths are still outlined. I don't feel too
        bad about the LockAlgorithm.h header being included in so many places because we change
        that algorithm so infrequently.
        
        Also, I added a hasElapsed(time) function. This function makes it so much more natural
        to write timeslicing code, which the concurrent GC has to do a lot of.

        This is useful for simulating memory allocation failures on resource constraint
        devices for testing purposes.

        This facility is only conditionally compiled in on debug builds.  It does not
        have any burden on release builds at all.  When in use, the max single allocation
        size limit applies to individual allocations.  For malloc (and similar), the
        allocation will crash in FastMalloc if the requested size exceeds the set max
        single allocation size.  For tryMalloc (and similar), the allocation returns
        nullptr if the requested size exceeds the set max single allocation size.  The
        max single allocation size is set to std::numeric_limit<size_t>::max() by default
        (i.e. when not set and no limit is in effect).

        Also fixed non-bmalloc versions of fastAlignedMalloc() to crash when allocation
        fails.

        Implement WTF::Expected
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164526

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        std::expected isn't in C++17, and may be in C++20. It's a nice
        complement to std::any / std::optional because it's a type-tagged
        union which has a single expected result but could also contain an
        error.

        This would be useful in the WebAssembly parser, for example.

        Using this implementation will allow us to provide feedback to the
        standards committee and guide std::expected's design before it
        gets standardized. I've already sent a bunch of feedback to the
        author based on my experience implementing this.

        This could supplement WTF::Either and WTF::ExceptionOr.

        WTF::ParkingLot should stop using std::chrono because std::chrono::duration casts are prone to overflows
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152045

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.
        
        We used to use 'double' for all time measurements. Sometimes it was milliseconds,
        sometimes it was seconds. Sometimes we measured a span of time, sometimes we spoke of time
        since some epoch. When we spoke of time since epoch, we either used a monotonic clock or
        a wall clock. The type - always 'double' - never told us what kind of time we had, even
        though there were roughly six of them (sec interval, ms interval, sec since epoch on wall,
        ms since epoch on wall, sec since epoch monotonic, ms since epoch monotonic).
        
        At some point, we thought that it would be a good idea to replace these doubles with
        std::chrono. But since replacing some things with std::chrono, we found it to be terribly
        inconvenient:
        
        - Outrageous API. I never want to say std::chrono::milliseconds(blah). I never want to say
          std::chrono::steady_clock::timepoint. The syntax for duration_cast is ugly, and ideally
          duration_cast would not even be a thing.
        
        - No overflow protection. std::chrono uses integers by default and using anything else is
          clumsy. But the integer math is done without regard for the rough edges of integer math,
          so any cast between std::chrono types risks overflow. Any comparison risks overflow
          because it may do conversions silently. We have even found bugs where some C++
          implementations had more overflows than others, which ends up being a special kind of
          hell. In many cases, the overflow also has nasal demons.
        
        It's an error to represent time using integers. It would have been excusable back when
        floating point math was not guaranteed to be supported on all platforms, but that would
        have been a long time ago. Time is a continuous, infinite concept and it's a perfect fit
        for floating point:
        
        - Floating point preserves precision under multiplication in all but extreme cases, so
          using floating point for time means that unit conversions are almost completely
          lossless. This means that we don't have to think very hard about what units to use. In
          this patch, we use seconds almost everywhere. We only convert at boundaries, like an API
          boundary that wants something other than seconds.
        
        - Floating point makes it easy to reason about infinity, which is something that time code
          wants to do a lot. Example: when would you like to timeout? Infinity please! This is the
          most elegant way of having an API support both a timeout variant and a no-timeout
          variant.

        - Floating point does well-understood things when math goes wrong, and these things are
          pretty well optimized to match what a mathematician would do when computing with real
          numbers represented using scientific notation with a finite number of significant
          digits. This means that time math under floating point looks like normal math. On the
          other hand, std::chrono time math looks like garbage because you have to always check
          for multiple possible UB corners whenever you touch large integers. Integers that
          represent time are very likely to be large and you don't have to do much to overflow
          them. At this time, based on the number of bugs we have already seen due to chrono
          overflows, I am not certain that we even understand what are all of the corner cases
          that we should even check for.
        
        This patch introduces a new set of timekeeping classes that are all based on double, and
        all internally use seconds. These classes support algebraic typing. The classes are:
        
        - Seconds: this is for measuring a duration.
        - WallTime: time since epoch according to a wall clock (aka real time clock).
        - MonotonicTime: time since epoch according to a monotonic clock.
        - ClockType: enum that says either Wall or Monotonic.
        - TimeWithDynamicClockType: a tuple of double and ClockType, which represents either a
          wall time or a monotonic time.
        
        All of these classes behave like C++ values and are cheap to copy around since they are
        very nearly POD. This supports comprehensive conversions between the various time types.
        Most of this is by way of algebra. Here are just some of the rules we recognize:
        
        WallTime = WallTime + Seconds
        Seconds = WallTime - WallTime
        MonotonicTime = MonotonicTime + Seconds
        etc...
        
        We support negative, infinite, and NaN times because math.
        
        We support conversions between MonotonicTime and WallTime, like:
        
        WallTime wt = mt.approximateWallTime()
        
        This is called this "approximate" because the only way to do it is to get the current time
        on both clocks and convert relative to that.
        
        Many of our APIs would be happy using whatever notion of time the user wanted to use. For
        those APIs, which includes Condition and ParkingLot, we have TimeWithDynamicClockType. You
        can automatically convert WallTime or MonotonicTime to TimeWithDynamicClockType. This
        means that if you use a WallTime with Condition::waitUntil, then Condition's internal
        logic for when it should wake up makes its decision based on the current WallTime - but if
        you use MonotonicTime then waitUntil will make its decision based on current
        MonotonicTime. This is a greater level of flexibility than chrono allowed, since chrono
        did not have the concept of a dynamic clock type.
        
        This patch does not include conversions between std::chrono and these new time classes,
        because past experience shows that we're quite bad at getting conversions between
        std::chrono and anything else right. Also, I didn't need such conversion code because this
        patch only converts code that transitively touches ParkingLot and Condition. It was easy
        to get all of that code onto the new time classes.

        It's a ParkingLot bug: if we timeout and get unparked at the same time, then the unparking
        thread will clear our address eventually - but not immediately. This causes a nasty
        assertion failure. The tricky thing is that when we detect this, we need to wait until that
        unparking thread does the deed. Otherwise, they will still do it at some later time.
        
        Alternatively, we could use some kind of versioning to detect this - increment the version
        when you park, so that unparking threads will know if they are time travelers. That seems
        more yucky.
        
        I don't think it matters too much what we do here, so long as it's simple and correct, since
        this requires a race that is rare enough that it didn't happen once in my testing, and I was
        pretty thorough. For example, it didn't happen once in 15 runs of JetStream. The race is
        rare because it requires the timeout to happen right as someone else is unparking. Since
        it's so rare, its probably OK that the unparked thread waits just a tiny moment until the
        unparking thread is done.

        Baseline JIT should use AutomaticThread

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        Added a AutomaticThreadCondition::wait() method, so that if you really want to use one
        common condition for your thread and something else, you can do it. This trivially works
        if you only use notifyAll(), and behaves as you'd expect for notifyOne() (i.e. it's
        dangerous, since you don't know who will wake up).
        
        The Baseline JIT used the one-true-Condition idiom because it used notifyAll() in an
        optimal way: there are just two threads talking to each other, so it wakes up at most one
        thread and that thread is exactly the one you want woken up. Adding wait() means that I did
        not have to change that code.

          not in use.
        
        - AutomaticThreadCondition::notifyOne(). This required changes to Condition::notifyOne(). We

        WTF should make it easier to create threads that die automatically after inactivity
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163576

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        For a long time now, I've been adding threads to WTF/JSC and each time I do this, I feel
        guilty because those threads don't shut down when they are inactive. For example, in bug
        163562, I need to add a new GC thread. There will be one of them per VM. This means that a
        JSC API client that starts a lot of VMs will have a lot of threads. I don't think that's
        good.
        
        A common pattern for all of these threads is that they have some well-defined trigger that
        causes them to run. This trigger has a lock, a condition variable, some logic that determines
        if there is work to do, and then of course the logic for the thread's actual work. The thread
        bodies usually look like this:
        
        void Thingy::runThread()
        {
            for (;;) {
                Work work;
                {
                    LockHolder locker(m_lock);
                    while (!hasWork())
                        m_cond.wait(m_lock);
                    work = takeWork();
                }
                doWork(work);
            }
        }
        
        If you look at ParallelHelperPool (the GC's threads) and DFG::Worklist (some of the JIT's
        threads), you will see this pattern.
        
        This change adds a new kind of thread, called AutomaticThread, that lets you write threads to
        this pattern while getting automatic thread shutdown for free: instead of just waiting on a
        condition variable, AutomaticThread will have a timeout that causes the thread to die. The
        condition variable associated with AutomaticThread, called AutomaticThreadCondition, is smart
        enough to restart any threads that have decided to stop due to inactivity. The inactivity
        threshold is current just 1 second.
        
        In this patch I only adopt AutomaticThread for ParallelHelperPool. I plan to adopt it in more
        places soon.

        This removes the atomicity mode, because it's not really used: it only affects the
        concurrentBlah methods, but their only users turn on atomicity. This was useful because
        previously, some binary Bitmap methods (like merge(const Bitmap&)) couldn't be used
        effectively in the GC because some of the GC's bitmaps set the atomic mode and some didn't.
        Removing this useless mode is the best solution.
        
        Also added some new binary Bitmap methods: mergeAndClear(Bitmap& other) and
        setAndClear(Bitmap& other). They perform their action on 'this' (either merge or set,
        respectively) while also clearing the contents of 'other'. This is great for one of the GC

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This class represents a simple producer/consumer worker. It facilitates
        synchronizing enqueuing to and dequeuing from a fixed size-queue. It uses
        a single lock and a single condition to synchronize all its members among
        the working threads. This means a single thread is active at any time and
        and the other threads are blocked waiting for the lock to be released. Or
        they are sleeping waiting for the condition to be satisfied.

            if (!string)

                    result.iterator->value = new UnderlyingString(*string);
                else
                    ++result.iterator->value->refCount;
                underlyingString = result.iterator->value; // Point P2.
            }
            adoptUnderlyingString(underlyingString); // Point P5.
        }

        ... and ...

        void StringView::adoptUnderlyingString(UnderlyingString* underlyingString)
        {
            if (m_underlyingString) {
                // Point P0.
                if (!--m_underlyingString->refCount) {
                    if (m_underlyingString->isValid) { // Point P1.
                        std::lock_guard<StaticLock> lock(underlyingStringsMutex);
                        underlyingStrings().remove(&m_underlyingString->string); // Point P3.
                    }
                    delete m_underlyingString; // Point P4.
                }
            }
            m_underlyingString = underlyingString;
        }

        Imagine the following scenario:

        1. Thread T1 has been using an UnderlyingString U1, and is now done with it.
           T1 runs up to point P1 in adoptUnderlyingString(), and is blocked waiting for
           the underlyingStringsMutex (which is currently being held by Thread T2).
        2. Context switch to Thread T2.
           T2 wants to use UnderlyingString U1, and runs up to point P2 in setUnderlyingString()
           and releases the underlyingStringsMutex.
           Note: T2 thinks it has successfully refCounted U1, and therefore U1 is safe to use.
        3. Context switch to Thread T1.
           T1 acquires the underlyingStringsMutex, and proceeds to remove it from the
           underlyingStrings() map (see Point P3).  It thinks it has successfully done so
           and proceeds to delete U1 (see Point P4).
        4. Context switch to Thread T2.
           T2 proceeds to use U1 (see Point P5 in setUnderlyingString()).
           Note: U1 has already been freed.  This is a use after free.

        The fix is to acquire the underlyingStringsMutex at Point P0 in adoptUnderlyingString()
        instead of after P1.  This ensures that the decrementing of the UnderlyingString
        refCount and its removal from the underlyingStrings() map is done as an atomic unit.

        Note: If you look in StringView.cpp, you see another setUnderlyingString() which
        takes a StringView otherString.  This version of setUnderlyingString() can only
        be called from within the same thread that created the other StringView.  As a
        result, here, we are guaranteed that the UnderlyingString refCount is never zero,
        and there's no other threat of another thread trying to delete the UnderlyingString
        while we adopt it.  Hence, we don't need to acquire the underlyingStringsMutex
        here.

        This race condition was found when running layout tests fetch/fetch-worker-crash.html
        and storage/indexeddb/modern/opendatabase-versions.html when CHECK_STRINGVIEW_LIFETIME
        is enabled.  This issue resulted in those tests crashing due to a use-after-free.

        Speed up Heap::isMarkedConcurrently
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162095

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Heap::isMarkedConcurrently had a load-load fence which is expensive on weak memory ISAs such as ARM.

        This patch is fairly perf-neutral overall, but the GC's instrumentation reports:
          GC:Eden is 93% average runtime after change
          GC:Full is 76% average runtime after change

        The fence was there because:
         1. If the read of m_markingVersion in MarkedBlock::areMarksStale isn't what's expected then;
         2. The read of m_marks in MarkedBlock::isMarked needs to observe the value that was stored *before* m_markingVersion was stored.

        This ordering isn't guaranteed on ARM, which has a weak memory model.

        There are 3 ways to guarantee this ordering:
         A. Use a barrier instruction.
         B. Use a load-acquire (new in ARMv8).
         C. use ARM's address dependency rule, which C++ calls memory_order_consume.

        In general:
         A. is slow but orders all of memory in an intuitive manner.
         B. is faster-ish and has the same property-ish.
         C. should be faster still, but *only orders dependent loads*. This last part is critical! Consume isn't an all-out replacement for acquire (acquire is rather a superset of consume).

        ARM explains the address dependency rule in their document "barrier litmus tests and cookbook":

        > *Resolving by the use of barriers and address dependency*
        >
        > There is a rule within the ARM architecture that:
        > Where the value returned by a read is used to compute the virtual address of a subsequent read or write (this is known as an address dependency), then these two memory accesses will be observed in program order. An address dependency exists even if the value read by the first read has no effect in changing the virtual address (as might be the case if the value returned is masked off before it is used, or if it had no effect on changing a predicted address value).
        > This restriction applies only when the data value returned from one read is used as a data value to calculate the address of a subsequent read or write. This does not apply if the data value returned from one read is used to determine the condition code flags, and the values of the flags are used for condition code evaluation to determine the address of a subsequent reads, either through conditional execution or the evaluation of a branch. This is known as a control dependency.
        > Where both a control and address dependency exist, the ordering behaviour is consistent with the address dependency.

        C++'s memory_order_consume is unfortunately unimplemented by C++ compilers, and maybe unimplementable as spec'd. I'm working with interested folks in the committee to fix this situation: http://wg21.link/p0190r2
