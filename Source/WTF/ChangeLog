        Update the clampTo() template specialization that converts floating types into integer types so that
        it deals with NaN inputs in a well-defined manner. Previously, it would simply cast the NaN to the
        integer type, which was undefined behavior. We now return the minimum range boundary for the output
        when the input is NaN.

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        Since VM_FLAGS_PERMANENT must be supported by the kernel, let's make
        it so that the vm_map that passes this flag in can fail when running
        on the simulator. This is to support the use case of running a newer
        simulator on an older OS. When the call to vm_map fails when running
        on the simulator, we try again without the VM_FLAGS_PERMANENT flag.

        numberToStringSigned() was calling -number when number is negative. This could trigger undefined behavior
        since -number may not be representable in the input type. For example, if the type was int and number was
        INT_MIN, -INT_MIN would overflow and the result would be undefined. To address the issue, we now cast
        number to the destination *unsigned* type *before* negating it.
