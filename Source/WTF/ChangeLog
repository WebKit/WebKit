        [WTF] Implement WTF::ThreadGroup
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174081

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch implements WTF::ThreadGroup. It implements core of JSC::MachineThreads with more reliable way.
        JSC::MachineThreads was complicated because of managing dead threads. Each JSC::MachineThreads has its
        own TLS with a registered destructor. And everytime a thread dies, the registered TLS destructor is called.
        And this destructor will remove the current dying thread from JSC::MachineThreads.

        However the above implementation is tricky. And each JSC::MachineThreads requires own TLS space, which is
        not considered in WTF's Windows ThreadSpecific implementation. Current design works well since we only
        have small number of MachineThreads right now.

        Instead, we use more reliable way. After introducing WTF::Thread, WTF::Thread has WTF::Thread::didExit,
        which is called when associated TLS (with WTF::Thread) is destroyed. We leverage this mechanism to remove
        WTF::Thread from MachineThreads.

        This patch introduces WTF::ThreadGroup. It is tightly integrated with WTF::Thread: WTF::Thread knows
        ThreadGroups which includes this thread. And WTF::ThreadGroup of course knows WTF::Threads added to it.
        WTF::Thread::didExit carefully remove itself from WTF::ThreadGroups.

        The most important part of this patch is locking. WTF::Thread can die. And WTF::ThreadGroup can die.
        If we take a design using two fine grain locks in WTF::Thread and WTF::ThreadGroup, we easily encounter
        dead lock. Consider the following case.

        1. When adding WTF::Thread (TH) to WTF::ThreadGroup (THG), we first hold a lock of THG, and hold a lock of TH (locking order is THG -> TH).
        2. When TH dies, TH need to hold a lock of TH to iterate THGs. And we hold a lock of THG to unregister TH from it (locking order is TH -> THG).
        3. When suspending and resuming THs in THG, we first hold a lock of THG. And then, we hold a lock of TH to suspend and resume it (locking order is THG -> TH).
        4. When destroying THG, we need to hold a lock of TH to unregister THG from TH. We can hold a lock of THG before that (locking order is THG -> TH).

        Then, it easily causes dead lock. We cannot swap the locking order of (2) since iterating THG requires a lock of TH.
        To solve this problem, we introduce one global lock ThreadGroup::destructionMutex (GL).

        1. When adding WTF::Thread (TH) to WTF::ThreadGroup (THG), we first hold GL, and hold a lock of THG. Do not hold a
        lock of TH. TH's thread groups information is guarded by GL instead of a lock of TH (locking order is GL -> THG).
        2. When TH dies, TH need to hold GL to iterate THGs. And we hold a lock of THG to unregister TH from it (locking order is GL -> THG).
        3. When suspending and resuming THs in THG, we first hold a lock of THG. And then, we hold a lock of TH to suspend and resume it (locking order is THG -> TH).
        4. When destroying THG, we need to hold GL to unregister THG from TH. We can hold a lock of THG after that (locking order is GL -> THG).

        We still have a lock of THG. By separating GL and THG's lock, we can hold a lock of THG while completely unrelated TH is destructed which takes a lock of GL and unrelated THG.

        [WTF] Clean up StringStatics.cpp by using LazyNeverDestroyed<> for Atoms
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174150

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch cleans up StringStatics.cpp and remove it from the tree.

        1. Move StringImpl methods to appropriate place, "StringImpl.cpp".

        StringImpl::hashSlowCase() and StringImpl::concurrentHash() are defined in
        StringStatics.cpp. But they should be defined in StringImpl.cpp.
        This patch just moves them to StringImpl.cpp.

        2. Use LazyNeverDestroyed to initialize AtomicString atoms like emptyAtom.

        Previously, we initialized AtomicString atoms like emptyAtom in a hacky way.
        We first define them as extern global variables. However, AtomicString has
        a non-trivial constructor. Thus, we cannot do this because it requires global
        constructor calls. This is why we have StringStatics.cpp. In this file, we
        include "StaticConstructors.h". After including this file, all the global
        constructor call disabled in Windows. And in GCC environment, we allocate
        void* storage for that variable. And we use placement new in AtomicString::init()
        to initialize these storage.
        However, we already have better way for that: LazyNeverDestroyed. It just allocates
        storage like the above. And it does not have any global constructors. Thus
        we can just declare it as a global variable. And we initialize them lazily in
        AtomicString::init(). This way effectively avoids "StaticConstructors.h" hacky way.
        And it makes "StringStatics.cpp" unnecessary.
        Then, we just move these variables and AtomicString::init() to AtomicString.cpp.

        And we also change emptyAtom to emptyAtom() to get the value from LazyNeverDestroyed<>.

        our stack trace should always be "reasonable".

        WTF::StringImpl::copyChars segfaults when built with GCC 7

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        With GCC 7, StringImpl::copyChars() behaves as unexpected.
        This function violates strict aliasing rule.

        This optimization is originally introduced to improve performance
        in SunSpider's string tests in 2008. When running it in my Linux
        box, it no longer causes any observable difference. So, we just
        remove this optimization.

        [WTF] Clean up StringStatics.cpp by using LazyNeverDestroyed<> for Atoms
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174150

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch cleans up StringStatics.cpp and remove it from the tree.

        1. Move StringImpl methods to appropriate place, "StringImpl.cpp".

        StringImpl::hashSlowCase() and StringImpl::concurrentHash() are defined in
        StringStatics.cpp. But they should be defined in StringImpl.cpp.
        This patch just moves them to StringImpl.cpp.

        2. Use LazyNeverDestroyed to initialize AtomicString atoms like emptyAtom.

        Previously, we initialized AtomicString atoms like emptyAtom in a hacky way.
        We first define them as extern global variables. However, AtomicString has
        a non-trivial constructor. Thus, we cannot do this because it requires global
        constructor calls. This is why we have StringStatics.cpp. In this file, we
        include "StaticConstructors.h". After including this file, all the global
        constructor call disabled in Windows. And in GCC environment, we allocate
        void* storage for that variable. And we use placement new in AtomicString::init()
        to initialize these storage.
        However, we already have better way for that: LazyNeverDestroyed. It just allocates
        storage like the above. And it does not have any global constructors. Thus
        we can just declare it as a global variable. And we initialize them lazily in
        AtomicString::init(). This way effectively avoids "StaticConstructors.h" hacky way.
        And it makes "StringStatics.cpp" unnecessary.
        Then, we just move these variables and AtomicString::init() to AtomicString.cpp.

        And we also change emptyAtom to emptyAtom() to get the value from LazyNeverDestroyed<>.

        WTF::Thread should have the threads stack bounds.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173975

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        We move StackBounds from WTFThreadData to WTF::Thread.
        One important thing is that we should make valid StackBounds
        visible to Thread::create() caller. When the caller get
        WTF::Thread from Thread::create(), this WTF::Thread should
        have a valid StackBounds. But StackBounds information can be
        retrived only in the WTF::Thread's thread itself.

        We also clean up WTF::initializeThreading. StringImpl::empty()
        is now statically initialized by using constexpr constructor.
        Thus we do not need to call StringImpl::empty() explicitly here.
        And WTF::initializeThreading() does not have any main thread
        affinity right now in all the platforms. So we fix the comment
        in Threading.h. Then, now, WTF::initializeThreading() is called
        in UI thread when using Web thread in iOS.

        Remove copy of ICU headers from WebKit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116407

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Add an extra rsync command to CopyWTFHeaders which copies the ICU headers
        to DSTROOT/usr/local/include/. These headers already live inside a
        "unicode" folder, so an example path of a header is
        DSTROOT/usr/local/include/unicode/uchar.h. This is already in the search
        path of the other WebKit projects, so those other projects can remove
        their explicit listing of the old place these headers lived.

        Also add the remaining ICU 55.1 headers which the other projects (like
        WebCore) need. Revert any local changes to these headers in favor of
        using the GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS build setting. This is so we can
        compile the same way against unmodified headers.

        [WTF] Make double-conversion's cache data constant and drop double_conversion::initialize()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174124

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        We annotate double-conversion's cache data as const and constexpr. And move it out of function.
        Since they are not involving global constructors, they are compiled as rodata and initialized
        without calling double_conversion::initialize().

        And we drop double_conversion::initialize() function since it is no longer necessary.

        Remove copy of ICU headers from WebKit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116407

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Add an extra rsync command to CopyWTFHeaders which copies the ICU headers
        to DSTROOT/usr/local/include/. These headers already live inside a
        "unicode" folder, so an example path of a header is
        DSTROOT/usr/local/include/unicode/uchar.h. This is already in the search
        path of the other WebKit projects, so those other projects can remove
        their explicit listing of the old place these headers lived.

        Also add the remaining ICU 55.1 headers which the other projects (like
        WebCore) need. Revert any local changes to these headers in favor of
        using the GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS build setting. This is so we can
        compile the same way against unmodified headers.

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        In some architectures, like ARMv6 running on a Raspberry pi, the
        backtrace function from "execinfo.h" is returning 0. In
        that case, the RELEASE_ASSERT in StackTrace::captureStackTrace
        fails causing a runtime crash.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171668

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        MediaSource duration attribute is a double represented in MediaSource by a MediaTime instance created with

        Infinity when the double value passed as argument is greater than 2^64.

        This patch removes the overflow control mechanism when time value is represented as a double. This patch also
        modifies the behavior of mathematical operations between a double MediaTime and rational MediaTime: the rational
        MediaTime is converted to a double before applying the operation. Double MediaTime precision is the same as for
        double. Overflow mechanisms still apply to the conversion of a double MediaTime to rational with setTimescale()

        [WTF] Add RegisteredSymbolImpl
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173230

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        Most symbols are not registered in SymbolRegistry. However, we currently always
        allocate a pointer member to point to a SymbolRegistry, and this pointer is always null.
        SymbolImpl is immutable, and it will never be registered with a SymbolRegistry
        after it is created. Hence, this member is wasteful.

        Instead, we add a new derived class RegisteredSymbolImpl, which will set a flag in
        SymbolImpl to indicate that it is registered with a SymbolRegistry. The only way to
        create a RegisteredSymbolImpl is via a factory method provided by the SymbolRegistry.
        The factory method will pass the SymbolRegistry this pointer to the RegisteredSymbolImpl's
        constructor for initializing the RegisteredSymbolImpl's m_symbolRegistry field.
        By doing so,

        1. We do not need to set m_symbolRegistry after creating a Symbol. It is clean.
        2. We reduce the size of SymbolImpls that do not need to be registered.

        MediaTime class has rounding issues in different platforms
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172640

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        The way a timescale is set when creating a MediaTime from a double
        can create rounding issues in different platforms because in some
        rounding is made and in others, it truncates. This way we ensure a
        common behavior.

        Dumping MediaTimes is also confusing and by the output you don't
        know if it's containing a double or a fraction. Now, if it
        contains a double, it only prints the double because printing the
        fraction is misleading (it currently prints the double read as an
        integer) and if it contains a fraction it shows the fraction and
        its double representation separated by an = instead of a ,.

        This patch adds support for using a dispatch queue to handle our
        mach exceptions. We use a high priority concurrent dispatch queue
        to handle our mach exceptions. We don't know the priority of the
        thread whose exception we are handling so the most conservative
        answer is to respond with a high priority. These events are both
        rare and usually quite fast so it is likely not a significant cost
        when the thread with an exception has a low priority.

        In ThreadHolder for Windows, we need to construct HashMap<ThreadIdentifier, ThreadHolder*>.
        The problem is that ThreadHolder::platformInitialize touches Thread::id() even before Thread
        is not established. In that case, id() returns incorrect value.

        But, calling ThreadHolder::initialize() after waiting for completion of Thread::establish() is
        not a good idea. Since we already have NewThreadContext->creationMutex, we can wait for completion
        of Thread::establish() easily. However, if we do so, Thread::create() returns RefPtr<Thread> that
        may not call ThreadHolder::initialize() in its thread yet. In that case, ThreadHolder::get() fails.
        Thus, Windows WTF::waitForThreadCompletion implementation becomes broken. We can add a new mutex
        to wait for completion of ThreadHolder::initialize in the creator of the thread (like a ping-pong!).
        But it overly complicates the implementation.

        The following is overly complicated initialization phase.

        Creator -> AC mutex(1) -------> establishment -> RL mutex(1) ----------------------> AC mutex(2) ->

                               Thread -----------------> AC mutex(1) -> ThreadHolder init -> RL mutex(2) ->

        So, instead, in this patch, we just use Thread::currentID(). When calling ThreadHolder::initialize(),
        we pass ThreadIdentifier by using Thread::currentID(). This implementation works great because,

        1. ThreadHolder::initialize requires ThreadIdentifier only in Windows environment because Pthread
           ThreadHolder does not create HashMap<>. And this is used for obsolete Threading APIs. Thus this
           hack will be removed in the near future.

        2. In Windows, Thread::currentID() can return a valid value without using ThreadHolder. And it does
           not require Thread establishment. So, calling currentID() to initialize ThreadHolder is ok in
           Windows.

        Use Mach exceptions instead of signals where possible
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171865

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch enables using mach exceptions on darwin. The way the
        mach exception api works is that we create a mach port, which is
        like a file descriptor.  We then wait for a message to arrive on
        that port in a thread. When another thread raises an exception (say
        due to a bad memory access) the OS sends our thread a message. The
        payload of that message is the register file of the crashing
        thread. We then call our custom handlers that change the state as
        needed. In order to restart the thread we send a payload back to
        the OS with an updated register file along with a success message
        header.

        This patch also makes thread messages work without signals by
        simply suspending the thread, and then running the message at that
        time.

        NeverDestroyed<String>(ASCIILiteral(...)) is not thread safe.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171586
        <rdar://problem/31873190>

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        StaticStringImpl is meant to be thread-safe.  However, it has a bug: it did not
        set the s_hashFlagDidReportCost flag.  As a result, if cost() is called on it,
        different threads may try to change its flags bits at the same time.  This patch
        changes StaticStringImpl to always set the s_hashFlagDidReportCost flag.

        Also factored out StringImplShape and made StringImpl and StaticStringImpl extend
        it.  This makes it more clear that the 2 are intended to have the same shape.
        Note: there is already a static_assert that the 2 have the same size.  This
        change also ensures that they both have the same shape, which is a requirement in
        order for StaticStringImpl to work.

        Introduced the MAKE_STATIC_STRING_IMPL macro as a convenient way to instantiate
        StaticStringImpls from literal strings.  This allows us to trivially change

            NeverDestroyed<String> myString(ASCIILiteral("myString"));

        to ...

            NeverDestroyed<String> myString(MAKE_STATIC_STRING_IMPL("myString"));

        and by so doing, make it thread-safe.

        MAKE_STATIC_STRING_IMPL instantiates a lambda function to create the static
        StaticStringImpls.

        sendMessageScoped's signal handler calls LocklessBag::consumeAll, which causes heap deallocation in signal handler and leads deadlock
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171319

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        In sendMessageScoped, we call LocklessBag<SignalHandler>::consumeAll `thread->threadMessages().consumeAll()`.
        In LocklessBag::consumeAll, we call `delete` on Nodes.
        The problem is that this is called under the context of signal handler. Thus, when calling this, the original
        thread may hold the lock in bmalloc. In that case, this `delete` call attempts to lock the heap lock recursively,
        and causes deadlock.

        Instead, this patch transfers the LocklessBag's Node to the sender thread. And the sender thread deletes it instead.

        [JSC] Get stack pointer without pthread attr

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        If HAVE(MACHINE_CONTEXT) is not enabled, we get stack base and boundary by using
        pthread_attr functions. However, it is wrong since this function can be called
        after the thread is suspended. In that case, we should not call any functions
        that is not async signal safe. For example, pthread_getattr_np calls malloc.

        Instead we use getApproximateStackPointer(), which returns approximate stack pointer.

        Now, SIGUSR2 is used by ThreadMessage. Instead SIGUSR1 becomes empty.
        We should use some signal, that is not managed by WTF Signal mechanism
        because the behaivor of this suspend and resume is a bit tricky.
        For example, we set a bit tricky signal mask to sigaction to temporary
        block SIGUSR2 in the handler to avoid nested SIGUSR2. And we cannot
        use ThreadMessage to implement this mechanism because this suspend
        and resume handler will stop in the middle of the handler by sigsuspend.
        It is not the expected semantics by ThreadMessage.

        So now, we use SIGUSR1 instead. And we note that SIGUSR1 is used for
        pthread ports.

        Add signaling API
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170976

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch adds a bunch of new functionality to WTF. First, it add
        a new data structure of a lockless bag. The LocklessBag class can
        be used as either a multi-writer multi-reader lockless bag or a
        multi-writer single consumer lockless bag.

        Next, this patch adds an abstraction around sigaction in WTF.
        Basically, you can add a handler, which can be an arbitrary
        lambda. Although it should still be safe for the signal you are
        handling.  the signal handler manager will then do all the
        appropriate handling of chaining:

        In the SIGUSR case we always forward the signal to any other
        non-default handler installed before us. We need to do this,
        otherwise, since it's not possible to tell if a SIGUSR was
        intended exlusively for our handlers. Signal handlers don't record
        how many times they were sent only that there is at least one
        unhandled signal.

        In the faulting cases we require that every handle be able to
        recognise a fault they installed, vs crashes. If none of our
        handlers claim to have handled the fault we will forward the
        fault. If a handler was installed before the first fault handler
        we simply call that handler and rely on them to take the
        appropriate action. If no handler was installed before our first
        handler we restore the default handler and allow the fault to
        happen again.

        Finally, this patch adds a signal based messaging system.  This
        system allows the user to run an arbitrary lambda from the SIGUSR2
        signal handler of any target WTF::Thread. This is already in use
        for the VMTraps API which allows us to kill rogue VMs by sending
        the VM's running WTF::Thread a SIGUSR and requesting it jetison
        all optimized code and throw an uncatchable exception from all
        function entries/loop backedges.  In the future, we will also use
        this API for Wasm to reset the instruction caches in currently
        executing Wasm threads.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        We would like to relax Date.parse to accept the representation "May 8".
        At that time, we choose `2000` as a default year. This is because of
        the following reason.

        1. According to the V8, this default value is compatible to the old KJS. While current V8 uses 2001,
           SpiderMonkey does not have such a fallback path. So this reason is not big deal.

        2. It is a leap year. When using `new Date("Feb 29")`, we assume that people want to save month and day.
           Leap year can save user inputs if they is valid. If we use the current year instead, the current year
           may not be a leap year. In that case, `new Date("Feb 29").getMonth()` becomes 2 (March).

        [WTF] Introduce Thread class and use RefPtr<Thread> and align Windows Threading implementation semantics to Pthread one
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170502

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch is refactoring of WTF Threading mechanism to merge JavaScriptCore's threading extension to WTF Threading.
        Previously, JavaScriptCore requires richer threading features (such as suspending and resuming threads), and they
        are implemented for PlatformThread in JavaScriptCore. But these features should be implemented in WTF Threading side
        instead of maintaining JSC's own threading features too. This patch removes these features from JSC and move it to
        WTF Threading.

        However, current WTF Threading has one problem: Windows version of WTF Threading has different semantics from Pthreads
        one. In Windows WTF Threading, we cannot perform any operation after the target thread is detached: WTF Threading stop
        tracking the state of the thread once the thread is detached. But this is not the same to Pthreads one. In Pthreads,
        pthread_detach just means that the resource of the thread will be destroyed automatically. While some operations like
        pthread_join will be rejected, some operations like pthread_kill will be accepted.

        The problem is that detached thread can be suspended and resumed in JSC. For example, in jsc.cpp, we start the worker
        thread and detach it immediately. In worker thread, we will create VM and thus concurrent GC will suspend and resume
        the detached thread. However, in Windows WTF Threading, we have no reference to the detached thread. Thus we cannot
        perform suspend and resume operations onto the detached thread.

        To solve the problem, we change Windows Threading mechanism drastically to align it to the Pthread semantics. In the
        new Threading, we have RefPtr<Thread> class. It holds a handle to a platform thread. We can perform threading operations
        with this class. For example, Thread::suspend is offered. And we use destructor of the thread local variable to release
        the resources held by RefPtr<Thread>. In Windows, Thread::detach does nothing because the resource will be destroyed
        automatically by RefPtr<Thread>.

        To do so, we introduce ThreadHolder for Windows. This is similar to the previous ThreadIdentifierData for Pthreads.
        It holds RefPtr<Thread> in the thread local storage (technically, it is Fiber Local Storage in Windows). Thread::current()
        will return this reference.

        The problematic situation is that the order of the deallocation of the thread local storage is not defined. So we should
        not touch thread local storage in the destructor of the thread local storage. To avoid such edge cases, we have
        currentThread() / Thread::currentID() APIs. They are safe to be called even in the destructor of the other thread local
        storage. And in Windows, in the FLS destructor, we will create the thread_local variable to defer the destruction of
        the ThreadHolder. We ensure that this destructor is called after the other FLS destructors are called in Windows 10.

        This patch is performance neutral.

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch adds a new PriorityQueue class that is backed by
        WTF::Vector.  It also has a number of other niceties such as being
        able to iterate the queue and increase or decrease keys.

        One note is that increaseKey and decreaseKey are O(n) rather than
        O(log(n)).  Traditionally, the lookup of the key is done with a
        hash map but that's not feasible here.  This is because unless the
        queue's element type is a pointer there is no good way maintain a
        persistent reference to every entry in the queue while we sift.
        The only way to update the location of an entry is to do a hash
        table lookup with the entry's hash but this is probably more
        expensive than just doing a linear search.

        Also, add comparison operator functions, which can be passed to PriorityQueue.

        Kill any WebContent process using over 16 GB of memory.

        Restructure the code since it was getting out of sync with the intended behavior.
        Now there's a thresholdForMemoryKill() which returns the current memory limit based
        on the process status.

        The memory usage policy is separated from the killing, and now only drives the
        asynchronous invocations of pressure relief that occur when we pass over one of
        the policy edges (now 1GB for Conservative, 2GB for Strict.)

        Removed the "Panic" policy and moved the memory kill logic to shrinkOrDie().

        Behavior as of this patch:

            - Everyone gets killed over 16 GB.
            - Inactive processes get killed over 4 GB.
            - Strict memory usage policy kicks in at 2 GB.
            - Conservative memory usage policy at 1 GB.

        Like before, we make a best-effort attempt to free up memory before killing the process.

        Move Air::Liveness<> to WTF::Liveness<>. This is pretty easy since Air::Liveness<> was
        already fairly generic. It leverages the CFG concept so that it can understand many
        different kinds of basic blocks. It doesn't try to understand the contents of basic
        blocks; it just asks the adaptor for the block size and asks for the early/late
        uses/defs of each thing in the block.
        
        This makes it easy to create a B3::VariableLiveness, which fixSSA then uses for
        pruning. One of the new features is the Liveness::LiveAtHead nested class, which you
        instantiate if you want to perform liveAtHead queries, which SSA construction wants to
        do.

        This adds Atomic<>::loadLink and Atomic<>::storeCond, available only when HAVE(LL_SC).
        
        It abstracts loadLink/storeCond behind prepare/attempt. You can write prepare/attempt
        loops whenever your loop fits into the least common denominator of LL/SC and CAS.
        
        This modifies Atomic<>::transaction to use prepare/attempt. So, if you write your loop
        using Atomic<>::transaction, then you get LL/SC for free.

        Depending on the kind of transaction you are doing, you may not want to perform an LL
        until you have a chance to just load the current value. Atomic<>::transaction() assumes
        that you do not care to have any ordering guarantees in that case. If you think that
        the transaction has a good chance of aborting this way, you want
        Atomic<>::transaction() to first do a plain load. But if you don't think that such an
        abort is likely, then you want to go straight to the LL. The API supports this concept
        via TransactionAbortLikelihood.
        
        Additionally, this redoes the depend/consume API to be dead simple. Dependency is
        unsigned. You get a dependency on a loaded value by just saying
        dependency(loadedValue). You consume the dependency by using it as a bonus index to
        some pointer dereference. This is made easy with the consume<T*>(ptr, dependency)
        helper. In those cases where you want to pass around both a computed value and a
        dependency, there's DependencyWith<T>. But you won't need it in most cases. The loaded
        value or any value computed from the loaded value is a fine input to dependency()!
        
        This change updates a bunch of hot paths to use the new APIs. Using transaction() gives
        us optimal LL/SC loops for object marking and lock acquisition.
        
        This change also updates a bunch of hot paths to use dependency()/consume().
        
        This is a significant Octane/splay speed-up on ARM.

        Move MemoryPressureHandler down to WTF so it can be used from JavaScriptCore.

        I had to do a blind rewrite of the Windows memory checking timer since it can
        no longer use WebCore::Timer. I also moved the Win32Handle helper class to WTF.

        This patch creates a unified Text Breaking API, which can be backed by either ICU
        or CoreFoundation (for ports which can use it). Rather than using inheritance and
        virtual functions to implement this, because there are only two subclasses, the
        simpler option of just using a Variant is used instead. There is also a cache which
        allows you to reuse iterators without reconstructing them. This cache is better
        than the previous method of having a single static iterator because the cache
        lets you use two iterators simultaneously.

        In the future, I will hook up all iterators to use this shared class. However, for
        this patch, I've only hooked up the caret position iterator (backed by CoreFoundation
        on Cocoa ports and UBRK_CHARACTER on other ports).

        Better handle Thread and RunLoop initialization

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        Make initialization functions more independent so that they can run in different
        order. WTF::initializeMainThread initializes WTF threading, so that neither WTF nor JSC theading need to be
        initialized before. RunLoop::initializeMainRunLoop() requires main thread to be initialized in some
        ports, so it initializes main thread too. WebKit1 always calls WTF::initializeMainThreadToProcessMainThread()
        before RunLoop::initializeMainRunLoop() so there's no problem there. GC threads are initialized alwayas by the
        main thread. The rules should be simpler now:

          - JSC::initializeThreading: should always be called when JSC is used.
          - WTF::initializeThreading: only needs to be explicitly called when JSC is not used and process doesn't
            initialize a main thread or main run loop.
          - WTF::initializeMainThread: only needs to be explicitly called if process initializes a main thread but not a
            main run loop.
          - WTF::initializeMainThreadToProcessMainThread(): should always be called in WebKit1 before
            RunLoop::initializeMainRunLoop().
          - RunLoop::initializeMainRunLoop(): to initialize the main run loop. The only requirement is JSC::initializeThreading()
            to be called before if JSC is used.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        This has recently been added and the patch is good. It's just revealing a problem with our timers. The test is
        posting a message recursively, and also starts a timeout timer to finish the test. The timeout timer is never
        fired for us, because WebCore timers have lower priority than the one used by postMessage. ScriptExecutionContext
        uses Document::postTask, that uses scheduleOnMainThread, that uses RunLoop::dispatch(). We are not setting any
        priority for the timer used by RunLoop::dispatch, so it's using the default.
        Use a RunLoop::Timer to schedule tasks to the main thread instead of using RunLoop::dispatch(). This allows us
        to use a different priority, that is now set to G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE + 20 to match WebCore timers. But it also
        avoids the double queue we had with RunLoop::dispatch(), because scheduleOnMainThread() also queues the tasks.

        This has recently been added and the patch is good. It's just revealing a problem with our timers. The test is
        posting a message recursively, and also starts a timeout timer to finish the test. The timeout timer is never
        fired for us, because WebCore timers have lower priority than the one used by
        postMessage. ScriptExecutionContext uses Document::postTask, that uses scheduleOnMainThread, that uses
        RunLoop::dispatch(). We are not setting any priority for the timer used by RunLoop::dispatch, so it's using the
        default. RunLoop::dispatch is normally used to schedule tasks between threads, or just to ensure something is
        run in a different run loop iteration, but in general nothing urgent as a graphics redraw or something like
        that. It's quite common to use g_idle_add to schedule tasks between threads, so I think it makes sense to use
        G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE for the RunLoop timer.

        I made TinyPtrSet use bitwise_cast instead of static_cast
        for its singleEntry() function so that it can work on pointer-like
        types just as it can on actual pointer types.
        
        An example of where this matters is when you have TinyPtrSet<T>
        where T is defined to be a struct which wraps a pointer, e.g:

        StringView.split() should use an iterator design pattern instead of allocating a Vector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163225

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Implement StringView.split() using an iterator design.

        Using an iterator design avoids the need to allocate a Vector of StringView objects,
        which is space-inefficient and error prone as the returned Vector may outlive the
        lifetime of the underlying string associated with the split (as StringView is a non-
        owning reference to a string).

        StringView.split() now returns a StringView::SplitResult object that implements begin()/end()
        to support iterating over StringView substrings delimited by the specified separator
        character. For example, to iterate over the 'c'-separated substrings of a StringView v,
        you can write:

        for (StringView substring : v.split('c'))
            // Do something with substring.

        Remove the use of the RAII ThreadScope, since the use of RAII helped make this bug possible:
        we'd do ~ThreadScope after we had done ~LockHolder, so in between when we decided to shut
        down a thread and when it reported itself as being shut down, there was a window where a

        Now, we run all thread shutdown stuff while the lock is held. We release the lock last. One
        API implication is that threadWillStop becomes threadIsStopping and it's called while the

        WorkQueueGeneric's platformInvalidate() can deadlock when called on the RunLoop's thread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166645

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        WorkQueue can be destroyed on its invoking thread itself.
        The scenario is the following.

            1. Create WorkQueue (in thread A).
            2. Dispatch a task (in thread A, dispatching a task to thread B).
            3. Deref in thread A.
            4. The task is executed in thread B.
            5. Deref in thread B.
            6. The WorkQueue is destroyed, calling platformInvalidate in thread B.

        In that case, if platformInvalidate waits thread B's termination, it causes deadlock.
        We do not need to wait the thread termination.

        Leverage Substring to create new AtomicStringImpl for StaticStringImpl and SymbolImpl
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166636

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Previously we always create the full atomic string if we need to create the same string
        based on the given value. For example, when generating AtomicStringImpl from the SymbolImpl,
        we need to create a new AtomicStringImpl since SymbolImpl never becomes `isAtomic() == true`.
        But it is costly.

        This patch leverages the substring system of StringImpl. Instead of allocating the completely
        duplicate string, we create a substring StringImpl that shares the same content with the
        base string.

        It is more handy way to define static StringImpl. It calculates the length

        not need to calculate these things in Perl script.
        And it allows us to use StaticStringImpl in the hand written C++ code.
        Previously, we need to calculate the length and hash value by hand if we
        would like to use StaticASCIILiteral in the hand written C++ code, and it

        There is an inherent race in Condition::waitFor() where the timeout can happen just before
        a notify from another thread.

        Fixed this by adding a condition variable and flag to each AutomaticThread.  The flag
        is used to signify to a notifying thread that the thread is waiting.  That flag is set
        in the waiting thread before calling waitFor() and cleared by another thread when it
        notifies the thread.  The access to that flag happens when the lock is held.
        Now the waiting thread checks if the flag after a timeout to see that it in fact should
        proceed like a normal notification.

        The added condition variable allows us to target a specific thread.  We used to keep a list
        of waiting threads, now we keep a list of all threads.  To notify one thread, we look for
        a waiting thread and notify it directly.  If we can't find a waiting thread, we start a
        sleeping thread.

        We notify all threads by waking all waiting threads and starting all sleeping threads.

        Stop reinterpret_casting UBreakIterators to the undefined type TextBreakIterator
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165931

        We have a class declaration for TextBreakIterator but no definition for it. When we
        create an ICU UBreakIterator, we immediately reinterpret_cast it to this undefined
        type, and pass it around our code inside WebCore. Then, whenever we want to actually
        use this iterator, we reinterpret_cast it back to UBreakIterator. This is likely due
        to some ports historically implementing breaking interators on top of other libraries
        other than ICU; however, now, all ports use ICU. Because this internal type is not
        helpful and just adds confusion, we should just call our breaking iterators what
        they are: UBreakIterators.

        This patch is a mechanical replacement of TextBreakIterator to UBreakIterator and
        removes the functions we were calling which pass through directly to ubrk_*().

        Kraken json-stringify-tinderbox performance heavily relies on StringBuilder::appendQuotedJSONString.
        According to the result produced by Linux `perf`, it occupies 28% of execution time.

        We tighten the hottest loop in the above function. We create the super fast path for non escaping case.
        And add " and \ cases (since including " in the string is common). Then we fallback to the slow case.

        It improves the performance 5.5% in Kraken json-stringify-tinderbox in MBP.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147142

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        I wrote this patch while improving WebAssembly's error messages,
        and only found this bug afterwards. My implementation does the
        bare minimum to make this code variadic without changing
        behavior. I think it's better to go with this baby step first, and
        improve the code later.

        Notable, for my WebAssembly patch I also taught the code to handle
        integers and other types (including WebAssembly types). A
        follow-up could rely on ADL magic to pretty-format these other
        types.

        To find this bug, I needed to seriously beef up our logging infrastructure.
        
        It's now the case that:
        
            dataLog(...);
        
        will print its output atomically. This happens with some careful magic:
        
        - dataFile() is now a LockedPrintStream that locks around print().
        
        - The lock is a recursive lock via RecursiveLockAdapter<>, so if the dump methods end
          up calling back into dataLog() then it just works. This is important: say the dump()
          calls a getter that itself does logging, maybe because it's encountering badness and
          wants to report it before crashing).
        
        - The lock is a WordLock so that ParkingLot and Lock can keep using dataLog() for
          debugging. We probably won't need to debug WordLock anytime soon - the algorithm is
          so simple.
        
        - LockedPrintStream::print(...) causes the print callbacks of its arguments to run on
          the underlying PrintStream, so that you don't need to do recursive lock acquisition
          on each individual argument and whatever printing it does recursively.

        Adds the ability to say:

        Instead of having to say:
        
        Locker<LockType> locker(locks of type LockType)
        
        I think that we should use "auto locker = holdLock(lock)" as the default way that we acquire
        locks unless we need to use a special locker type.
        
        This also adds the ability to safepoint a lock. Safepointing a lock is basically a super fast
        way of unlocking it fairly and then immediately relocking it - i.e. letting anyone who is
        waiting to run without losing steam of there is noone waiting.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch moves SymbolImpl initialization from StringImpl to SymbolImpl.
        In SymbolImpl, we create the appropriate fields. At that time, these fields
        should be aligned to the BufferSubstring StringImpl.

        And we newly create the `m_flags` in SymbolImpl. Instead of using special
        StringImpl::null(), we store s_flagIsNullSymbol flag here. In WTF, we have
        the invariant that StringImpl::empty() is the only atomic empty string.
        But StringImpl::null() breaks this invariant. Using a special flag is safer
        way to represent the null Symbol `Symbol()`.

        Introduce StringImpl::StaticStringImpl with constexpr constructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165093

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch adds new class, StringImpl::StaticStringImpl.
        By using this class, we can easily create static StringImpls.
        This class has constexpr constructor. You can initialize instances
        of this class as global static variables without invoking global
        constructors.

        We already have similar system, StaticASCIILiteral. But using it
        requires some special perl script since we need to calculate
        hash value. On the other hand, we can use StaticStringImpl without
        any script supports since we implement constexpr hash function.
        In the future, we will replace all the use of StaticASCIILiteral
        with this StaticStringImpl.

        We define empty / null strings as StaticStringImpl. And we make
        StringImpl::empty() & StringImpl::null() inline functions.

        This is needed because of the peculiar behavior of is8Bit in String, different
        from any of our other string classes. I think we should consider changing
        String::is8Bit to return true for null strings. We could then remove this
        overload and probably remove other checks for null and zero length elsewhere
        that are also needed only to avoid calling is8Bit on a null String.

        [WTF] Import std::optional reference implementation as WTF::Optional
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164199

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Sam Weinig.

        Import std::optional reference implementation offered by the C++17
        original proposal paper. It has the same interface and functionality
        to the C++17's one. Previous WTF::Optional lacks several functionalities.
        The largest one is the correct constexpr constructors. This fact prevents
        us from using Optional<literal type> in constexpr context in WebKit.

        In WebKit, we do not allow global constructors. So only the constexpr
        constructor is the way to use WTF::Optional in the static const
        global variables. WTF::Optional is used in DOMJIT::Effect and
        we would like to emit static const global variables that includes
        this DOMJIT::Effect. That is the main motivation of this work.
        This functionality allows the IDL code generator to emit DOMJIT
        signatures as static const global variables.

        We import the reference implementation one instead of LLVM libc++'s one.
        This is because LLVM libc++'s one depends on many macro and type_traits
        offered by libc++ implementation. And adopting it to WebKit requires
        large modification compared to this reference implementation one.
        Furthermore, it is difficult to compile libc++'s optional in old GCC and VC++.
        It also requires some more modifications. To keep the thing simple,
        we import the reference implementation one now. Once C++17 is released
        and we update the compiler baseline, we can smoothly switch to the standard
        library's std::optional.

        We also add support for the environment that does not use exceptions to this
        reference implementation.

        And we also add valueOrCompute helper function. That keeps the extended
        functionality that previous WTF::Optional has.

        The reason why I went to such great pains to make WTF::Lock fit in two bits is that I
        knew that I would eventually need to stuff one into some miscellaneous bits of the
        JSCell header. That time has come, because the concurrent GC has numerous race
        conditions in visitChildren that can be trivially fixed if each object just has an
        internal lock. Some cell types might use it to simply protect their entire visitChildren
        function and anything that mutates the fields it touches, while other cell types might
        use it as a "lock of last resort" to handle corner cases of an otherwise wait-free or
        lock-free algorithm. Right now, it's used to protect certain transformations involving
        indexing storage.
        
        To make this happen, I factored the WTF::Lock algorithm into a LockAlgorithm struct that
        is templatized on lock type (uint8_t for WTF::Lock), the isHeldBit value (1 for
        WTF::Lock), and the hasParkedBit value (2 for WTF::Lock). This could have been done as
        a templatized Lock class that basically contains Atomic<LockType>. You could then make
        any field into a lock by bitwise_casting it to TemplateLock<field type, bit1, bit2>. But
        this felt too dirty, so instead, LockAlgorithm has static methods that take
        Atomic<LockType>& as their first argument. I think that this makes it more natural to
        project a LockAlgorithm onto an existing Atomic<> field. Sadly, some places have to cast
        their non-Atomic<> field to Atomic<> in order for this to work. Like so many other things
        we do, this just shows that the C++ style of labeling fields that are subject to atomic
        ops as atomic is counterproductive. Maybe some day I'll change LockAlgorithm to use our
        other Atomics API, which does not require Atomic<>.
        
        WTF::Lock now uses LockAlgorithm. The slow paths are still outlined. I don't feel too
        bad about the LockAlgorithm.h header being included in so many places because we change
        that algorithm so infrequently.
        
        Also, I added a hasElapsed(time) function. This function makes it so much more natural
        to write timeslicing code, which the concurrent GC has to do a lot of.

        This facility is only conditionally compiled in on debug builds.  It does not

        size limit applies to individual allocations.  For malloc (and similar), the
        allocation will crash in FastMalloc if the requested size exceeds the set max
        single allocation size.  For tryMalloc (and similar), the allocation returns
        nullptr if the requested size exceeds the set max single allocation size.  The
        max single allocation size is set to std::numeric_limit<size_t>::max() by default

        WTF::ParkingLot should stop using std::chrono because std::chrono::duration casts are prone to overflows
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152045

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.
        
        We used to use 'double' for all time measurements. Sometimes it was milliseconds,
        sometimes it was seconds. Sometimes we measured a span of time, sometimes we spoke of time
        since some epoch. When we spoke of time since epoch, we either used a monotonic clock or
        a wall clock. The type - always 'double' - never told us what kind of time we had, even
        though there were roughly six of them (sec interval, ms interval, sec since epoch on wall,
        ms since epoch on wall, sec since epoch monotonic, ms since epoch monotonic).
        
        At some point, we thought that it would be a good idea to replace these doubles with
        std::chrono. But since replacing some things with std::chrono, we found it to be terribly
        inconvenient:
        
        - Outrageous API. I never want to say std::chrono::milliseconds(blah). I never want to say
          std::chrono::steady_clock::timepoint. The syntax for duration_cast is ugly, and ideally
          duration_cast would not even be a thing.
        
        - No overflow protection. std::chrono uses integers by default and using anything else is
          clumsy. But the integer math is done without regard for the rough edges of integer math,
          so any cast between std::chrono types risks overflow. Any comparison risks overflow
          because it may do conversions silently. We have even found bugs where some C++
          implementations had more overflows than others, which ends up being a special kind of
          hell. In many cases, the overflow also has nasal demons.
        
        It's an error to represent time using integers. It would have been excusable back when
        floating point math was not guaranteed to be supported on all platforms, but that would
        have been a long time ago. Time is a continuous, infinite concept and it's a perfect fit
        for floating point:
        
        - Floating point preserves precision under multiplication in all but extreme cases, so
          using floating point for time means that unit conversions are almost completely
          lossless. This means that we don't have to think very hard about what units to use. In
          this patch, we use seconds almost everywhere. We only convert at boundaries, like an API
          boundary that wants something other than seconds.
        
        - Floating point makes it easy to reason about infinity, which is something that time code
          wants to do a lot. Example: when would you like to timeout? Infinity please! This is the
          most elegant way of having an API support both a timeout variant and a no-timeout
          variant.

        - Floating point does well-understood things when math goes wrong, and these things are
          pretty well optimized to match what a mathematician would do when computing with real
          numbers represented using scientific notation with a finite number of significant
          digits. This means that time math under floating point looks like normal math. On the
          other hand, std::chrono time math looks like garbage because you have to always check
          for multiple possible UB corners whenever you touch large integers. Integers that
          represent time are very likely to be large and you don't have to do much to overflow
          them. At this time, based on the number of bugs we have already seen due to chrono
          overflows, I am not certain that we even understand what are all of the corner cases
          that we should even check for.
        
        This patch introduces a new set of timekeeping classes that are all based on double, and
        all internally use seconds. These classes support algebraic typing. The classes are:
        
        - Seconds: this is for measuring a duration.
        - WallTime: time since epoch according to a wall clock (aka real time clock).
        - MonotonicTime: time since epoch according to a monotonic clock.
        - ClockType: enum that says either Wall or Monotonic.
        - TimeWithDynamicClockType: a tuple of double and ClockType, which represents either a
          wall time or a monotonic time.
        
        All of these classes behave like C++ values and are cheap to copy around since they are
        very nearly POD. This supports comprehensive conversions between the various time types.
        Most of this is by way of algebra. Here are just some of the rules we recognize:
        
        WallTime = WallTime + Seconds
        Seconds = WallTime - WallTime
        MonotonicTime = MonotonicTime + Seconds
        etc...
        
        We support negative, infinite, and NaN times because math.
        
        We support conversions between MonotonicTime and WallTime, like:
        
        WallTime wt = mt.approximateWallTime()
        
        This is called this "approximate" because the only way to do it is to get the current time
        on both clocks and convert relative to that.
        
        Many of our APIs would be happy using whatever notion of time the user wanted to use. For
        those APIs, which includes Condition and ParkingLot, we have TimeWithDynamicClockType. You
        can automatically convert WallTime or MonotonicTime to TimeWithDynamicClockType. This
        means that if you use a WallTime with Condition::waitUntil, then Condition's internal
        logic for when it should wake up makes its decision based on the current WallTime - but if
        you use MonotonicTime then waitUntil will make its decision based on current
        MonotonicTime. This is a greater level of flexibility than chrono allowed, since chrono
        did not have the concept of a dynamic clock type.
        
        This patch does not include conversions between std::chrono and these new time classes,
        because past experience shows that we're quite bad at getting conversions between
        std::chrono and anything else right. Also, I didn't need such conversion code because this
        patch only converts code that transitively touches ParkingLot and Condition. It was easy
        to get all of that code onto the new time classes.

        It's a ParkingLot bug: if we timeout and get unparked at the same time, then the unparking
        thread will clear our address eventually - but not immediately. This causes a nasty
        assertion failure. The tricky thing is that when we detect this, we need to wait until that
        unparking thread does the deed. Otherwise, they will still do it at some later time.
        
        Alternatively, we could use some kind of versioning to detect this - increment the version
        when you park, so that unparking threads will know if they are time travelers. That seems
        more yucky.
        
        I don't think it matters too much what we do here, so long as it's simple and correct, since
        this requires a race that is rare enough that it didn't happen once in my testing, and I was
        pretty thorough. For example, it didn't happen once in 15 runs of JetStream. The race is
        rare because it requires the timeout to happen right as someone else is unparking. Since
        it's so rare, its probably OK that the unparked thread waits just a tiny moment until the
        unparking thread is done.

        Baseline JIT should use AutomaticThread

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.
        
        Added a AutomaticThreadCondition::wait() method, so that if you really want to use one
        common condition for your thread and something else, you can do it. This trivially works
        if you only use notifyAll(), and behaves as you'd expect for notifyOne() (i.e. it's
        dangerous, since you don't know who will wake up).
        
        The Baseline JIT used the one-true-Condition idiom because it used notifyAll() in an
        optimal way: there are just two threads talking to each other, so it wakes up at most one
        thread and that thread is exactly the one you want woken up. Adding wait() means that I did
        not have to change that code.

          thread, and also means that now those resources will naturally free up when the Worklist is
          not in use.
        
        - AutomaticThreadCondition::notifyOne(). This required changes to Condition::notifyOne(). We

        WTF should make it easier to create threads that die automatically after inactivity
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163576

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        For a long time now, I've been adding threads to WTF/JSC and each time I do this, I feel
        guilty because those threads don't shut down when they are inactive. For example, in bug
        163562, I need to add a new GC thread. There will be one of them per VM. This means that a
        JSC API client that starts a lot of VMs will have a lot of threads. I don't think that's
        good.
        
        A common pattern for all of these threads is that they have some well-defined trigger that
        causes them to run. This trigger has a lock, a condition variable, some logic that determines
        if there is work to do, and then of course the logic for the thread's actual work. The thread
        bodies usually look like this:
        
        void Thingy::runThread()
        {
            for (;;) {
                Work work;
                {
                    LockHolder locker(m_lock);
                    while (!hasWork())
                        m_cond.wait(m_lock);
                    work = takeWork();
                }
                doWork(work);

        If you look at ParallelHelperPool (the GC's threads) and DFG::Worklist (some of the JIT's
        threads), you will see this pattern.
        
        This change adds a new kind of thread, called AutomaticThread, that lets you write threads to
        this pattern while getting automatic thread shutdown for free: instead of just waiting on a
        condition variable, AutomaticThread will have a timeout that causes the thread to die. The
        condition variable associated with AutomaticThread, called AutomaticThreadCondition, is smart
        enough to restart any threads that have decided to stop due to inactivity. The inactivity
        threshold is current just 1 second.
        
        In this patch I only adopt AutomaticThread for ParallelHelperPool. I plan to adopt it in more
        places soon.

        This removes the atomicity mode, because it's not really used: it only affects the
        concurrentBlah methods, but their only users turn on atomicity. This was useful because
        previously, some binary Bitmap methods (like merge(const Bitmap&)) couldn't be used
        effectively in the GC because some of the GC's bitmaps set the atomic mode and some didn't.
        Removing this useless mode is the best solution.
        
        Also added some new binary Bitmap methods: mergeAndClear(Bitmap& other) and
        setAndClear(Bitmap& other). They perform their action on 'this' (either merge or set,
        respectively) while also clearing the contents of 'other'. This is great for one of the GC

            }

        ... and ...

        void StringView::adoptUnderlyingString(UnderlyingString* underlyingString)
        {

                // Point P0.
                if (!--m_underlyingString->refCount) {
                    if (m_underlyingString->isValid) { // Point P1.
                        std::lock_guard<StaticLock> lock(underlyingStringsMutex);
                        underlyingStrings().remove(&m_underlyingString->string); // Point P3.
                    }
                    delete m_underlyingString; // Point P4.
                }
            }
            m_underlyingString = underlyingString;
        }

        Imagine the following scenario:

        1. Thread T1 has been using an UnderlyingString U1, and is now done with it.
           T1 runs up to point P1 in adoptUnderlyingString(), and is blocked waiting for
           the underlyingStringsMutex (which is currently being held by Thread T2).
        2. Context switch to Thread T2.
           T2 wants to use UnderlyingString U1, and runs up to point P2 in setUnderlyingString()
           and releases the underlyingStringsMutex.
           Note: T2 thinks it has successfully refCounted U1, and therefore U1 is safe to use.
        3. Context switch to Thread T1.
           T1 acquires the underlyingStringsMutex, and proceeds to remove it from the
           underlyingStrings() map (see Point P3).  It thinks it has successfully done so
           and proceeds to delete U1 (see Point P4).
        4. Context switch to Thread T2.
           T2 proceeds to use U1 (see Point P5 in setUnderlyingString()).
           Note: U1 has already been freed.  This is a use after free.

        The fix is to acquire the underlyingStringsMutex at Point P0 in adoptUnderlyingString()
        instead of after P1.  This ensures that the decrementing of the UnderlyingString
        refCount and its removal from the underlyingStrings() map is done as an atomic unit.

        Note: If you look in StringView.cpp, you see another setUnderlyingString() which
        takes a StringView otherString.  This version of setUnderlyingString() can only
        be called from within the same thread that created the other StringView.  As a
        result, here, we are guaranteed that the UnderlyingString refCount is never zero,
        and there's no other threat of another thread trying to delete the UnderlyingString
        while we adopt it.  Hence, we don't need to acquire the underlyingStringsMutex
        here.

        This race condition was found when running layout tests fetch/fetch-worker-crash.html
        and storage/indexeddb/modern/opendatabase-versions.html when CHECK_STRINGVIEW_LIFETIME
        is enabled.  This issue resulted in those tests crashing due to a use-after-free.

        Speed up Heap::isMarkedConcurrently
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162095

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Heap::isMarkedConcurrently had a load-load fence which is expensive on weak memory ISAs such as ARM.

        This patch is fairly perf-neutral overall, but the GC's instrumentation reports:
          GC:Eden is 93% average runtime after change
          GC:Full is 76% average runtime after change

        The fence was there because:
         1. If the read of m_markingVersion in MarkedBlock::areMarksStale isn't what's expected then;
         2. The read of m_marks in MarkedBlock::isMarked needs to observe the value that was stored *before* m_markingVersion was stored.

        This ordering isn't guaranteed on ARM, which has a weak memory model.

        There are 3 ways to guarantee this ordering:
         A. Use a barrier instruction.
         B. Use a load-acquire (new in ARMv8).
         C. use ARM's address dependency rule, which C++ calls memory_order_consume.

        In general:
         A. is slow but orders all of memory in an intuitive manner.
         B. is faster-ish and has the same property-ish.
         C. should be faster still, but *only orders dependent loads*. This last part is critical! Consume isn't an all-out replacement for acquire (acquire is rather a superset of consume).

        ARM explains the address dependency rule in their document "barrier litmus tests and cookbook":

        > *Resolving by the use of barriers and address dependency*
        >
        > There is a rule within the ARM architecture that:
        > Where the value returned by a read is used to compute the virtual address of a subsequent read or write (this is known as an address dependency), then these two memory accesses will be observed in program order. An address dependency exists even if the value read by the first read has no effect in changing the virtual address (as might be the case if the value returned is masked off before it is used, or if it had no effect on changing a predicted address value).
        > This restriction applies only when the data value returned from one read is used as a data value to calculate the address of a subsequent read or write. This does not apply if the data value returned from one read is used to determine the condition code flags, and the values of the flags are used for condition code evaluation to determine the address of a subsequent reads, either through conditional execution or the evaluation of a branch. This is known as a control dependency.
        > Where both a control and address dependency exist, the ordering behaviour is consistent with the address dependency.

        C++'s memory_order_consume is unfortunately unimplemented by C++ compilers, and maybe unimplementable as spec'd. I'm working with interested folks in the committee to fix this situation: http://wg21.link/p0190r2
