        There 2 relevant functions at play:

        void StringView::setUnderlyingString(const StringImpl* string)
        {
            UnderlyingString* underlyingString;
            if (!string)
                underlyingString = nullptr;
            else {
                std::lock_guard<StaticLock> lock(underlyingStringsMutex);
                auto result = underlyingStrings().add(string, nullptr);
                if (result.isNewEntry)
                    result.iterator->value = new UnderlyingString(*string);
                else
                    ++result.iterator->value->refCount;
                underlyingString = result.iterator->value; // Point P2.
            }
            adoptUnderlyingString(underlyingString); // Point P5.
        }

        ... and ...

        void StringView::adoptUnderlyingString(UnderlyingString* underlyingString)
        {
            if (m_underlyingString) {
                // Point P0.
                if (!--m_underlyingString->refCount) {
                    if (m_underlyingString->isValid) { // Point P1.
                        std::lock_guard<StaticLock> lock(underlyingStringsMutex);
                        underlyingStrings().remove(&m_underlyingString->string); // Point P3.
                    }
                    delete m_underlyingString; // Point P4.
                }
            }
            m_underlyingString = underlyingString;
        }

        Imagine the following scenario:

        1. Thread T1 has been using an UnderlyingString U1, and is now done with it.
           T1 runs up to point P1 in adoptUnderlyingString(), and is blocked waiting for
           the underlyingStringsMutex (which is currently being held by Thread T2).
        2. Context switch to Thread T2.
           T2 wants to use UnderlyingString U1, and runs up to point P2 in setUnderlyingString()
           and releases the underlyingStringsMutex.
           Note: T2 thinks it has successfully refCounted U1, and therefore U1 is safe to use.
        3. Context switch to Thread T1.
           T1 acquires the underlyingStringsMutex, and proceeds to remove it from the
           underlyingStrings() map (see Point P3).  It thinks it has successfully done so
           and proceeds to delete U1 (see Point P4).
        4. Context switch to Thread T2.
           T2 proceeds to use U1 (see Point P5 in setUnderlyingString()).
           Note: U1 has already been freed.  This is a use after free.

        The fix is to acquire the underlyingStringsMutex at Point P0 in adoptUnderlyingString()
        instead of after P1.  This ensures that the decrementing of the UnderlyingString
        refCount and its removal from the underlyingStrings() map is done as an atomic unit.

        Note: If you look in StringView.cpp, you see another setUnderlyingString() which
        takes a StringView otherString.  This version of setUnderlyingString() can only
        be called from within the same thread that created the other StringView.  As a
        result, here, we are guaranteed that the UnderlyingString refCount is never zero,
        and there's no other threat of another thread trying to delete the UnderlyingString
        while we adopt it.  Hence, we don't need to acquire the underlyingStringsMutex
        here.

        This race condition was found when running layout tests fetch/fetch-worker-crash.html
        and storage/indexeddb/modern/opendatabase-versions.html when CHECK_STRINGVIEW_LIFETIME
        is enabled.  This issue resulted in those tests crashing due to a use-after-free.

        Speed up Heap::isMarkedConcurrently
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162095

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Heap::isMarkedConcurrently had a load-load fence which is expensive on weak memory ISAs such as ARM.

        This patch is fairly perf-neutral overall, but the GC's instrumentation reports:
          GC:Eden is 93% average runtime after change
          GC:Full is 76% average runtime after change

        The fence was there because:
         1. If the read of m_markingVersion in MarkedBlock::areMarksStale isn't what's expected then;
         2. The read of m_marks in MarkedBlock::isMarked needs to observe the value that was stored *before* m_markingVersion was stored.

        This ordering isn't guaranteed on ARM, which has a weak memory model.

        There are 3 ways to guarantee this ordering:
         A. Use a barrier instruction.
         B. Use a load-acquire (new in ARMv8).
         C. use ARM's address dependency rule, which C++ calls memory_order_consume.

        In general:
         A. is slow but orders all of memory in an intuitive manner.
         B. is faster-ish and has the same property-ish.
         C. should be faster still, but *only orders dependent loads*. This last part is critical! Consume isn't an all-out replacement for acquire (acquire is rather a superset of consume).

        ARM explains the address dependency rule in their document "barrier litmus tests and cookbook":

        > *Resolving by the use of barriers and address dependency*
        >
        > There is a rule within the ARM architecture that:
        > Where the value returned by a read is used to compute the virtual address of a subsequent read or write (this is known as an address dependency), then these two memory accesses will be observed in program order. An address dependency exists even if the value read by the first read has no effect in changing the virtual address (as might be the case if the value returned is masked off before it is used, or if it had no effect on changing a predicted address value).
        > This restriction applies only when the data value returned from one read is used as a data value to calculate the address of a subsequent read or write. This does not apply if the data value returned from one read is used to determine the condition code flags, and the values of the flags are used for condition code evaluation to determine the address of a subsequent reads, either through conditional execution or the evaluation of a branch. This is known as a control dependency.
        > Where both a control and address dependency exist, the ordering behaviour is consistent with the address dependency.

        C++'s memory_order_consume is unfortunately unimplemented by C++ compilers, and maybe unimplementable as spec'd. I'm working with interested folks in the committee to fix this situation: http://wg21.link/p0190r2
