/* This isn't really a header. It's a preprocessor for-each loop.
   
   To generate code for each page config kind, just do:
   
       #define PAS_DEFINE_HEAP_CONFIG_KIND(name, page_config_value) \
           ... the code you want for pas_heap_config_kind_##name \
               and (page_config_value) ...
       #include "pas_heap_config_kind.def"
       #undef PAS_DEFINE_HEAP_CONFIG_KIND
   
   For example, this can be used to create switch statements as an alternative to adding virtual
   functions or fields to heap_config. Generally, we only use this when we have no
   other alternative (like the unified deallocation log). */
