    /* We maintain the invariant that each bit index in the alloc bits bitvector can be resolved to
       a sharing granule by downshifting by page_config->sharing_shift, such that each sharing granule
       has at most one partial view.
       
       We guarantee this by saying that once a partial view plants an alloc bit, it keeps claiming
       object until the bump pointer gets to another sharing granule. For example, if the sharing_shift
       is 1 and we allocate a 3-byte object, then we will claim the first two sharing granules (0 and
       1) and place the bump pointer at 3, which is still inside a sharing granule we have already
       claimed (1). So, we will bump the pointer again to 6, and claim another sharing granule (2),
       giving that partial view an extra object.
    
       Note that this has a goofy locking protocol:
    
       - We hold both the commit and ownership locks when adding a partial view to its *first*
         entry in this array. That first entry will be first both chronologically and it will have
         the smallest index.
    
       - We hold only the ownership lock when adding a partial view to additional entries in the
         list.
    
       - We never remove things from this list and we hold the ownership lock when destroying the
         handle. Handle destruction requires the page to be empty, so for example if you know you
         are freeing an object but haven't signaled emptiness yet, then you know that this cannot
         get deleted. Also, to delete it, the ownership lock is flashed, so if you hold the
         ownership lock and establish that the shared_view->is_owned, then you know that this list
         cannot change.
    
       You can scan this list to find all of the partial views, but that gets weird. If you hold
       the commit lock, you can use partial_view->noted_in_scan to track which views you've already
       seen. But that requires holding the commit lock. If you only hold the ownership lock then
       you can still loop over this, and you can even rely on it not changing, but you have to
       come up with your own way to ensure you don't see the same thing more than once. */
