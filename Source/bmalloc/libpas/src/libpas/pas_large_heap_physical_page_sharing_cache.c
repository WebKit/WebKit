       to do that until we actually finish servicing this allocation, since the memory we would
       decommit right now might be the memory we are about to use to satisfy the memory allocation
       request.
       
       Because of the cleverness of the large free heaps, the memory we return here may be first
       coalesced with some already-free memory and then returned. So, of we decommit right now, we
       might decommit that memory. That would not be wrong, but it would be a waste of time, since
       we will recommit it.
       
       Instead we rely on two properties:
       
       - Incurring a negative physical page balance here ensures that once we have the memory
         allocation in hand, we will take the right number of physical pages. Since at that point
         we would have already marked the memory we allocated as committed, we will be sure not to
         take that memory.
       
       - It's OK to decommit after allocating in this case. Normally we ensure that we schedule the
         commit to happen after the decommit, because we're All About keeping peak memory low. But
         here, the memory we have gotten from the OS is still clean, so it doesn't count against our
         peak dirty. */
