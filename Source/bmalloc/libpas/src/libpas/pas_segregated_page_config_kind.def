   To generate code for each page config kind, just do:
   
       #define PAS_DEFINE_SEGREGATED_PAGE_CONFIG_KIND(name, page_config_value) \
           ... the code you want for pas_segregated_page_config_kind_##name \
               and (page_config_value) ...
       #include "pas_segregated_page_config_kind.def"
       #undef PAS_DEFINE_SEGREGATED_PAGE_CONFIG_KIND
   
   For example, this can be used to create switch statements as an alternative to adding virtual
   functions or fields to segregated_page_config. Generally, we only use this when we have no
   other alternative (like the unified deallocation log). */
