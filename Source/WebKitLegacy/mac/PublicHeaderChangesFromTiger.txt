This file lists changes to WebKit public header files that have been made since WebKit-412, which shipped with Mac OS X 10.4. All of these changes will have to be approved by the Apple API approval process, or rolled out, before Apple ships a new version of WebKit.

When you make changes to public header files, please update this file, in the same general style as the ChangeLog file (new entries at top).
===============================================

Removed -[DOMHTMLInputElement isTextField] from DOMExtensions.h. I changed it to _isTextField and put it in
DOMPrivate.h instead, until we decide what we want to do about the public API.

Added -[DOMHTMLInputElement isTextField] to DOMExtensions.h (in WebCore, copied by build steps to WebKit).
This is used by autocomplete code in Safari and could be moved there, but is a better fit in WebKit and
is useful for developers.

Added the following values to the enum of WebMenuItem tags in WebUIDelegate.h:

    WebMenuItemTagOpenWithDefaultApplication,
    WebMenuItemPDFActualSize,
    WebMenuItemPDFZoomIn,
    WebMenuItemPDFZoomOut,
    WebMenuItemPDFAutoSize,
    WebMenuItemPDFSinglePage,
    WebMenuItemPDFFacingPages,
    WebMenuItemPDFContinuous,
    WebMenuItemPDFNextPage,
    WebMenuItemPDFPreviousPage,

These are all used by the context menu for PDF documents.
