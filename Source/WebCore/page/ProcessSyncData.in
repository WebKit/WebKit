# This file contains a list of data generated by a Page in one WebContent process
# that needs to be synchronized to other WebContent processes.
#
# It is processed by `generate-process-sync-data.py`
#
# The format is:
#     <Data name> : <Data type>
#
# Example:
# `MainFrameURLChange : WTF::URL`
#
# That declaration results in:
# - A new `MainFrameURLChange` type being added to the generated `ProcessSyncDataType` enum class
# - The inclusion of `WTF::URL` in the `ProcessSyncDataVariant` variant
# - `void broadcastMainFrameURLChangeToOtherProcesses(const WTF::URL&);` being added to ProcessSyncClient
# - Updates to the `ProcessSyncData` struct and its serialization.in file so CoreIPC messaging works
#
# To send a "main frame url change" message to all other processes from manually written code:
# `page->processSyncClient().broadcastMainFrameURLChange(someURL);`
#
# The message sending to the UI process and re-routing of the broadcast to relevant WebContent processes
# is automatic; no additional code needs to be written for simple broadcasts.
#
# To handle a "main frame url change" update in the processes targetted by the broadcast, update:
# `void Page::updateProcessSyncData(const ProcessSyncData& data)`
# by handling the new enum mentioned above.
#
# (Since it defaults to unhandled, the build will fail pointing you exactly where to go)
#
# If <Data type> needs a header for its definition, add its header to the space delimited `headers: ` list


headers: <wtf/URL.h>
