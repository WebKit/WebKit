        Start splitting CSS Selectors's pseudo types
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130003

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        CSS Selectors pseudo types come in 3 flavors: page, pseudo class, pseudo elements.

        The three types are mixed together in a single enum list named PseudoType. Only some combinations
        of match type + pseudo type are valid, but this is implicitly defined from the code.

        This patch is the beginning of a refactoring to add more clear boundaries between
        valid and invalid combinations.

        First, the handling of page pseudo types is completely split from the other values.
        The parser use a different method for handling the value CSSParserSelector::parsePagePseudoSelector().

        PagePseudo types no longer store their string in the CSSSelector either to reduce the redundancy
        with m_pseudoType.
        When we need to generate the string for those CSSSelector, we recreate the string as needed in
        CSSSelector::selectorText().

        The remaining two types are not yet split in this patch but this introduce the preliminary clean up
        toward that goal.
        The list of parsed pseudo types is now generated at compile time from the source in SelectorPseudoTypeMap.in.

        * DerivedSources.make:
        The mapping of strings to pseudo types is generated from SelectorPseudoTypeMap.in

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        TextIterator refinements:
        - Use StringView instead of deprecatedCharacters to point to characters within strings.
        - Added TextIteratorCopyableText, a safe way to copy the current text of a TextIterator,
          for use by WordAwareIterator.
        - Removed m_shouldStop; iterators stop by setting m_positionNode to null, and there is no
          need for a separate boolean to do the same thing.
        - Got rid of all the boolean data members set based on the text iterator behavior; instead
          store the behavior in a data member and check it directly.
        - Changed most functions to use references rather than pointers.
        - Small micro-optimizations, such as using fastGetAttribute rather than getAttribute.
        - Switched to nullptr instead of 0 where appropriate.
        - Removed unused functions.
        - Cut down on use of abbreviations instead of words.

        iOS has a special FrameLoader::forceLayoutWithoutRecalculatingStyle()
        function that is called instead of FrameView::forceLayout(). This was unimplemented
        for the WK2 FrameLoaderClient, so no layout was forced, with the result
        that the contentSize was never updated and scrolling was broken.
        
        Fix by renaming the client function to forceLayoutOnRestoreFromPageCache()
        and having it return a bool to say whether the default forceLayout()
        should be done. WK1 can then continue to have its custom behavior,
        and Wk2 will simply do a forceLayout().
        
        Also remove FrameLaoderClient::forceLayout(), which was never called.

        Allow media element to supply the video layer after fullscreen transition has already begun.

        Instead of borrowing the videolayer from the HTMLMediaElement, WebVideoFullscreen now supplies a layer to HTMLMediaElement to fill in as needed and at the appropriate time.

        Subpixel rendering: Simple compositing container layer (isSimpleContainerCompositingLayer) paints to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129861

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that both the simple and non-simple cases paint to the same position.
        Simple compositing container layer codepath needs to take the fractional device pixel offset
        into account when painting. Without the fractional value, the final paint rounding could push the
        paint offset to a different position.
        retina example:
        compositing top-left: 0px 0px.
        fractional offset: 0.3px 0.3px
        painting coords without offseting: 0px 0px

        Traversal failure in a direct adjacent chain with tail backtracking lacks the path to clear the tail

        Direct adjacent backtracking use the stack to push the backtracking entry point and recover from there.
        In case of traversal failure, their is no point in recovering from the indirect adjancent entry point and
        we should clear entry point from the stack (which is the purpose of the tail).

        The adjancent tail was missing the part for clearing the stack in one case.

        The case with adjancent backtracking inside descendant backtracing was doing everything right. This patch
        generalize this code and the correct tail is fully generated by generateAdjacentBacktrackingTail().

        JumpToClearAdjacentDescendantTail becomes JumpToClearAdjacentTail, and this new backtracking state is added

        After fixing the leak in r165252, I was surprised to find that it didn't

        pages back to the OS until there is memory pressure.

        Since we are just faking the memory pressure on bots, we have to let
        system malloc in on the fun, so we can get representative numbers.

        Fixes an issue where an assertion failure would occur when visiting a web site whose on-disk
        app cache doesn't contain a manifest resource.

        For some reason an app cache for a web site may be partially written to disk. In particular, the
        app cache may only contain a CacheGroups entry. That is, the manifest resource and origin records
        may not be persisted to disk. From looking over the code, we're unclear how such a situation can occur
        and hence have been unable to create such an app cache. We were able to reproduce this issue using
        an app cache database file that was provided by a person that was affected by this issue.

        No test included because it's not straightforward to write a test for this change.

            The root cause is CompositeEditCommand::moveParagraphWithClones() passing

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        outlineBoundsForRepaint() is expected to return the outline repaint rect. Using enclosingIntRect()
        to calculate the outline boundaries breaks repaint logic in RenderElement::repaintAfterLayoutIfNeeded().
        Since enclosingIntRect() can return bigger rect than repaint rect, the old/new bounds' dimensions could end up
        being different which triggers the size change repaint code path.

        appendChild shouldn't invalidate LiveNodeLists and HTMLCollections if they don't have valid caches
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129727

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Before this patch, invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestors invalidated node lists and HTML
        collections on ancestors of a node whenever we're inserting or removing a child node. This patch
        makes HTMLCollections and LiveNodeLists register themselves with Document only when they have valid
        caches.

        Each user of CollectionIndexCache now implements willValidateIndexCache member function that gets
        called when CollectionIndexCache caches any state and necessitates the registration with document.

        * dom/ChildNodeList.h: Added an empty willValidateIndexCache since child node lists are never
        registered with document.

        * dom/CollectionIndexCache.h:
        (WebCore::CollectionIndexCache::hasValidCache): Added.
        (WebCore::CollectionIndexCache::nodeCount): Calls willValidateIndexCache when caching node count.
        (WebCore::CollectionIndexCache::nodeAfterCached): Ditto. Also assert that hasValidCache() true in
        the cases where we're simply updating our caches or adding more caches.
        (WebCore::CollectionIndexCache::nodeAt): Ditto. Also added a code to set the length cache when
        we've reached the end of the list. This should be a slight speed up on some cases.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::Document): Initializes a variable used by assertions.
        (WebCore::Document::unregisterNodeList): Added an early exit for when m_listsInvalidatedAtDocument

        call collectionCachedIdNameMap in HTMLCollection.
        (WebCore::Document::unregisterCollection): Ditto. Exit early if m_collectionsInvalidatedAtDocument

        * dom/Node.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCaches): Swap the lists since invalidateCache
        tries to unregister node lists and HTML collections with document. Since this is the only case in

        This regression started happening after we adopted the setPresentationValue 
        ScrollbarPainter API which allows us to update the position of the scrollbar knob 
        from our secondary scrolling thread. The bug occurs when the scrollbar grows while 
        it still thinks it is in presentation-value mode. Whenever the scrollbar grows, it 
        should be in non-presentation value mode.

        If the wheel event has ended or been cancelled, we can switch out of presentation 
        value mode.

        [iOS] Start playback button misplaced
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129628

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        On YouTube embeds, while the video is loading it is placed into the DOM with a 0x0 size.
        This causes the start playback button to be visible in the upper-left corner of the embed
        area. The button wasn't visible previously (in plugin mode) because the plugin clipped its
        drawing to its bounds, and so the <video> shadow should do the same.

        Space between double underlines does not scale with font size
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129521

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch moves the logic about how far to draw the second underline (when text-decoration-style: double
        is specified) from InlineTextBox to GraphicsContext, because GraphicsContext is the authoritative source
        about how thick underlines should be. The space between the two underlines is set to the thickness of
        each of the underlines.

        This patch also deletes some unused code in InlineTextBox that was never getting triggered, in addition
        to unifying drawLineForText with drawLinesForText. This didn't have any performance impact in my testing.

        [CSS Shapes] Serialize circle positions

        Circle positions should always be present when serialized, and should
        only have the 2 or 4-valued form. Keywords are converted to percentages
        and simplified where possible. This patch adds some additional processing
        that converts the parsed position into the serialized format, before
        converting it to text. See http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-shapes/#basic-shape-serialization.

        Updated existing parsing tests.

        [CSS Regions] Overset computation is incorrect in some cases
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129032

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie.

        This patch reworks the way overset is computed for regions and named flows.

        1. Regions overflow no longer trigger an overset changed event. This is because
        the overflow of a box is contained within the region range of the box. The content
        edge should be considered the logical bottom position of the content inside the
        flow thread.

        2. The regions events logic was moved from RenderFlowThread to RenderNamedFlowThread
        and from RenderRegion to RenderNamedFlowFragment (including the regionOverset property).

        3. The overset value of the named flow is no longer stored in the named flow. It is
        extracted from the overset of the last region in the chain.

        4. The regions overset is not computed every time the flow thread is laid out which
        should improve performance for flows with many regions. With the patch, each region
        computes the overset value during its layout when the flow thread is in the overflow
        or the final layout phase.

        5. The overset changed event is dispatched only at the end of the layout of the named flows,
        after all the region overset changes have been considered. This means that the overset
        event can't be dispatched in the middle of the auto-height processing algorithm that
        requires multiple layout passes for the flow threads.

        However, the region layout update event dispatch timing was not changed, it is dispatched
        every time the flow thread has a layout. This preserves the current behavior of the event.

        Tests: The old tests were modified to take into account the change.

        Web Replay: upstream input storage, capture/replay machinery, and inspector domain
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128782

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher, Joseph Pecoraro, and Andreas Kling.

        No new tests yet, as they rely on infrastructure tracked in https://webkit.org/b/129190.

        Replayable executions are organized into ReplaySessions, which can
        contain several ReplaySessionSegments that divide overall execution
        at main frame navigation boundaries. NondeterministicInput subclasses
        are stored in SegmentedInputStorage according to the input's InputQueue.

        Capture and playback are controlled at the page granularity by the Page's
        ReplayController. The controller knows how to create new segments, replay to
        arbitrary positions in the ReplaySession, and track the active InputCursor.

        The capturing and replaying input cursor subclasses encapsulate state for
        storing new inputs and loading/dispatching saved inputs, respectively.

        The ReplayAgent and associated inspector protocol domain is the friendly
        public API for programmatically capturing and replaying sessions.

        The remaining attribute checkers appear to be less common than the simple value match.

        [iOS][WK2] Pages using tiled compositing layers allocate too many tiles on zoom
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129471

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        A few issues with TileController were causing sublayers of the root layers
        to tile incorrect surfaces on zoom.

        First, the exposedRect API was not updating the sublayers. The layers go correctly
        into tiling mode, but the tiles cover the full document instead of the visible area.

        The other major issue was the margins being applied to the coverage size in document
        coordinates. Since each margin is 512px, the total coverage size after zoom was
        gigantic.

        To solve this, this patch switch from the exposedRect API to the generic concept
        of VisibleExtentContentRect introduced for iOS WebKit1.

        * platform/ScrollView.h:

        a factor of 1.5.
        ViewUpdateDispatcher has all the information to compute a great tile coverage, I will need
        a follow up patch to fix that.

        When both src and srcset had only 1x descriptors and the DPR was higher than 1, the src's resource was picked.

        Also fixed the invalid descriptor handling, which wasn't aligned with the spec, and therefore was not as forward compatible as it should be.
        Invalid descriptors caused the entire resource to be ignored, rather than just the descriptors themselves.

        Split UserActivity, simplify PageThrottler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129551

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The class UserActivity currently implements two things – a hysteresis mechanism, and
        an abstraction of NSActivity controlled by that mechanism. PageThrottler implements
        its own hysteresis mechanism, which directly controls DOM timer throttling and also
        controls a couple of UserActivities, giving a total of 3 separate hysteresis mechanisms,
        layered two deep.

        Split UserActivity into three, with HysteresisActivity implementing an abstract hysteresis
        mechanism, UserActivity::Impl controlling the NSActivity, and then UserActivity combining
        these two back together. The interface to UserActivity is unchanged.

        Remove PageThrottler's bespoke hysteresis, replacing it with a use of HysteresisActivity.
        Replace the two UserActivities with a single UserActivity::Impl, so there are no longer
        layered hysteresis mechanisms.

        Ensure keySplines is valid in SMIL animations
        <http://webkit.org/b/129547>

        http://crbug.com/276111

            This patch fixes a crash in SMIL animations when keySplines are not
            specified. The SMIL spec is clear on this:
            http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncCalcMode
            "If there are any errors in the keyTimes specification (bad values,
            too many or too few values), the animation will have no effect."

            This patch simply checks that keyTimes is not empty. Previously,
            splinesCount was set to be m_keySplines.size() + 1 in
            SVGAnimationElement.cpp; this patch changes splinesCount to be equal
            to m_keySplines.size() to make the logic easier to follow and to
            match other checks in SVGAnimationElement::startedActiveInterval.

        Tighten minimumRegisterRequirements()

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Fix small things that made minimumRegisterRequirements() a little optimistic
        when dealing with attributes.

        * cssjit/SelectorCompiler.cpp:
        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::SelectorCodeGenerator::SelectorCodeGenerator):
        Attribute Set does not do value matching, the case sensitive value matching is irrelevant
        The problem is that flag is also used by minimumRegisterRequirements()
        to find if one more register is needed.

        Set the flag to case sensitive to avoid reserving one extra register.

        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::minimumRegisterRequirements):
        Use a new backtrackingFlag to know if there is a descendant tail, thus a backtracking register
        reserved.
        This is better than using the backtracking action because the backtracking chain could be
        an adjacent chain inside a descendant chain.

        The flags are designed for that, just set one for minimumRegisterRequirements().

        The 2 extra registers for the attribute count and address become limited to all attributes
        except the last one. We don't keep a copy for the last matching, those registers were not needed.

        Fix srcset related bugs

        Fixed a bug reported against Blink's srcset implementation at https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347998
        When both src and srcset had only 1x descriptors and the DPR was higher than 1, the src's resource was picked.

        Also fixed the invalid descriptor handling, which wasn't aligned with the spec, and therefore was not as forward compatible as it should be.
        Invalid descriptors caused the entire resource to be ignored, rather than just the descriptors themselves.

        Improve "bad parent" and "bad child list" assertions in line boxes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125656

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        My previous fix for this problem was incomplete. This continuation of that fix addresses
        the flaw in the original and adds additional lifetime checking so problems can be seen in
        debug builds without a memory debugger.

        * rendering/InlineBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::InlineBox::assertNotDeleted): Added. Poor man's memory debugging helper.
        (WebCore::InlineBox::~InlineBox): Refactored body into a new function named
        invalidateParentChildList. Added code to update the deletion sentinel to record
        that this object is deleted.
        (WebCore::InlineBox::setHasBadParent): Moved here from header since this debug-only
        feature does not need to be inlined. Added a call to assertNotDeleted.
        (WebCore::InlineBox::invalidateParentChildList): Added. Refactored from the destructor,
        this is used by RenderTextLineBoxes.

        * rendering/InlineBox.h: Added the deletion sentinel, and called it in the parent
        function. Also changed the expansion/setExpansion functions to use the type name "int",
        since we don't use the type name "signed" in the WebKit coding style.

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::~InlineFlowBox): Call setHasBadChildList rather than doing the
        setHasBadParent work on children directly, to avoid code duplication.
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::setHasBadChildList): Moved here from header. Added code to set
        "has bad parent" on all children, something we previously did only on destruction. Also
        added assertNotDeleted.
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::checkConsistency): Added call to assertNotDeleted. Also tweaked
        code style and variable names a little bit.

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.h: Moved setHasBadChildList out of the header when it's on.
        The empty version for ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION_DISABLED is still in the header.

        * rendering/RenderTextLineBoxes.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTextLineBoxes::invalidateParentChildLists): Call the new
        InlineBox::invalidateParentChildList function instead of calling setHasBadChildList directly.
        The new function checks m_hasBadParent, something we couldn't do here.

        Optimized querySelector(All) when selector contains #id

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Test: fast/selectors/querySelector-id-filtering.html

        The idea of this patch is to perform querySelector on a subtree
        rooted at the last element with #id matching. For example, if we have the selector
        "#foobar div a", we start by looking for the element with ID foobar in the TreeScope
        cache, and start matching the children from there.

        The idea comes from Rune for

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        A filtered SVG element with a sigle dimension bigger than 5000
        (counting the margin/border) will fail to render. So an element
        with 4000x4000 will render fine, while another with 5000x10
        won't. This patch instead tests against the total element area,
        which fixes such cases.

        It also fixes some layer violations where FilterEffectRenderer and
        RenderSVGResourceFilter were directly accessing the maximum filter
        size in FilterEffect. Since before a somewhat bigger filter would
        be aborted, it required to change the maximum kernel size
        for blur filter (some filters are slower to run than others for
        bigger SVGs).

        [CSS Grid Layout] Fix positioning grid items using named grid lines/areas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129372

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Our code was assuming that a <custom-ident> in
        -webkit-grid-{column|row}-{start|end} and
        -webkit-grid-{column|row} was always a grid area name. That's
        wrong because the <custom-ident> could be also a explicitly named
        grid line or the an implicitly named grid line created by a grid
        area definition.

        The style resolution code was not correct either. This patch fixes
        it so it now matches the spec, which means that:
        - first we try to match any existing grid area.
        - then if there is a named grid line with the name
        <custom-ident>-{start|end} for -webkit-grid-{column|row}-{start|end}
        defined before the grid area then we use it instead of the grid
        area.
        - otherwise if there is a named grid line we resolve to the first such line.
        - otherwise we treat it as 'auto'.

        Fixing this uncovered a bug in GridPosition, we were not using the
        name of the stored grid area to check if two GridPositions were
        the same.

        In the css3-text spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#bidi-linebox):

        The start and end edges of a line box are determined by the inline

        When the video element is collected in a named flow and displayed in a region, we ensure

        However, we have to do that only if the named flow regions are validated.

        I changed the method cachedRegionForCompositedLayer to check only the "cached" region
        for a layer and not update the layer to region mappings before returning the region.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Report the extra memory cost of HTMLCollection to JSC.

        Unfortunately, the existing mechanism to report the extra memory cost in toJS is insufficient for
        HTMLCollection since collection caches are populated later when HTMLCollection is accessed. Also,
        the extra memory cost reported by Heap::reportExtraMemoryCost will be thrown away after a major GC.

        To work around this limitation, added a visitor.reportExtraMemoryUsage call inside visitChildren
        for interfaces with a newly added ReportExtraMemoryCost IDL extension flag to report the extra cost.

        Since we may need to generate visitChildren when this flag is set, we can't automatically detect
        and generate calls using C++ template as done in r148648.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Add support for compiling value matching when matching attributes in Selector.
        This patch only adds exact matching, the other cases will follow.

        There is a little infrastructure changes since FunctionCall now needs to support
        calls taking 2 arguments. The fun begins when the arguments are not in the right
        registers and need to be moved to the right place. Otherwise the code is straightforward.

        In SelectorCompiler, it is necessary to handle two different cases of matching: case sensitive
        and case insensitive. The choice is done in part at compilation time by asking HTMLDocument
        if the name filter can include case insensitive attribute. The other part is done at runtime
        by querying the element for its type and document.

        Test: fast/selectors/case-insensitive-value-matching.html

        * css/SelectorChecker.cpp:
        (WebCore::attributeValueMatches): Null values matching should never happen, when an attribute
        has no value, its value is empty.

        (WebCore::FunctionCall::swapArguments):
        Here we need to swap two registers, but we cannot allocate a new register (because the context
        of the function call may have taken all the available registers already).

        On x86, the solution is simple, we can swap the two registers without side effects.

        On other platforms, it is a little more complex. If there is any available register, we can just
        use it as a temporary to make the swap.
        If there are no available registers, we know that all the registers are taken. Since swapArguments()
        was called after pushing all the arguments on the stack, we can safely trash the value of any of those.
        We take the first available register that is not a function argument and use it as a temporary.

        (WebCore::FunctionCall::prepareAndCall):
        This is the fun part, we have two registers where the values must go before the function call. The values
        can be in any combination of the allocated registers. The code here needs to move the two values to
        their target register while avoiding conflicts.

        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::AttributeMatchingInfo::selector):
        The value of HTMLDocument::isCaseSensitiveAttribute is needed at compilation time to compute the number
        of required registers. As a result, we need to keep it along in the selector fragment.

        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::SelectorCodeGenerator::generateElementAttributeMatching):
        The matching code is moved in a local scope. This is done to recover the register of qualifiedNameImpl
        before doing any value matching. That register can then be used to store the expected value when matching
        an attribute value.
        It is unfortunate there is so much register pressure in this part.

        Value matching is done outside the loop. The idea is to keep the loop really small since in the vast majority
        of cases, name matching fails.
        If the value matching fails, we jump back into the tight loop.

        This is not ideal in all situation. For example trivial name matching with trivial value matching should
        be done in loop. There is a FIXME to improve those cases later.

        In the case sensitive branch, things are really simple. We have to AtomicStringImpl pointers, if they
        don't match, it is a failure.

        The case sensitive branch start by comparing the pointers in case the values are equal. This is a common
        case and it simplifies the cases for SVG, XHTML, etc.
        If the two values are not equal, we must first find if the context requires case insensitive comparison
        (HTMLElement in HTMLDocument). If the conditions require case insensitive matching, we then fall back
        to a function call.

        text-decoration-skip: ink does not skip over SVG fonts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128936

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When drawing glyphs in an SVG font, the glyphs are converted to paths and then filled. This patch moves
        the glyph -> path conversion into a helper class, GlyphToPathTranslator, and creates an implementation
        for the SVG drawing code. Once this helper class is created, it can be used to trace paths in order
        to make underlines skip over SVG glyphs. This helper class also has an implementation for non-SVG glyphs,
        which allows for the glyph tracing code to be paramaterized over the implementation of the helper class
        rather than if the FontData itself is SVG or not.

        Indenting an indented image element resulted in an extra indentation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129201

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        The bug was caused by endOfParagraph returning a position at the beginning of a block when the position
        passed into the function was at the beginning of the block. Consider the following DOM:
        <blockquote><img></blockquote>

        When endOfParagraph is called on (blockquote, 0), the condition r->isBR() || isBlock(n) in endOfParagraph
        matches immediately on startNode and it returns (blockquote, 0) again.

        This resulted in moveParagraphWithClones invoked by indentIntoBlockquote to erroneously clone the inner
        blockquote. Worked around this bug in ApplyBlockElementCommand::formatSelection by checking this specific
        condition and moving the position to the end of the block. Unfortunately, a lot of existing code depends
        on the current behavior of endOfParagraph so fixing the function itself was not possible.

        There was another bug in indentIntoBlockquote to incorrectly insert a new blockquote into the existing
        blockquote due to the code introduced in r99594 to avoid inserting before the root editable element.
        Since this happens only if outerBlock is the root editable element, which is nodeToSplitTo or an ancestor
        of nodeToSplitTo, explicitly look for this condition.

        don't wish to observe network reachability at all, add a global opt-out.

        Web Replay: route through UserInputBridge when delivering user inputs to WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128150

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add an UserInputBridge instance to each Page. WebKit2 routes a page's user inputs through
        the WebCore page's user input bridge so that the inputs can be selectively captured, filtered,
        and replayed using instrumentation inside the UserInputBridge.

        For now, the routing methods of UserInputBridge have no replay-specific code paths, and just
        put the input delivery code inside WebCore rather than its external clients. Replay-specific
        code paths will be added once https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128782 is fixed. However,
        once complete the code will work as follows:

        - When neither capturing or replaying, behavior is unchanged.

        - When capturing user inputs, each external input is saved into a replay log as it crosses
        the bridge from outside WebCore.

        - When replaying, the bridge closes and user inputs from WebKit2 are not accepted. Instead,
        the saved inputs from the replay log are re-dispatched as if they had crossed the bridge.

        [CSS Shapes] inset and inset-rectangle trigger assert with replaced element and large percentage dimension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129060

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        A bounds check was omitted when computing the width and height for inset
        rectangles, making it possible for the width or height to end up being
        negative. This patch adds in that check for both. It seems that only
        replaced elements like iframe and img trigger this problem.

        Remove unused InspectorCounters.
        <https://webkit.org/b/129367>

        The InspectorCounters code was only used to implement two layout test
        APIs (window.internals.numberOfLive{Nodes,Documents}) yet it had hooks
        in crazy places like Node construction and destruction.

        Rewrote the internals APIs to iterate over all live Documents instead,
        totaling up their referencing Node count. Added a process-global
        Document::allDocuments() HashSet to make this whole thing possible.

        Avoid unnecessary HTML Collection invalidations for id and name attribute changes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129361

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Before this patch, setting id and name attributes resulted in traversing all the ancestors to invalidate
        HTML collections on those nodes whenever we had more than one HTMLCollection alive.

        Avoid the traversal when HTMLCollections don't have any valid id and name map caches by making each
        HTMLCollection explicitly call collectionCachedIdNameMap and collectionWillClearIdNameMap when it caches
        or clears the id and name map.

        Border edges are painted as (semi)independent rectangles. When snapping an edge rectangle
        to device pixels, its painted dimensions depend on its size and its fractional position.
        Specific combination of position and border width can result in painting edges sized differently.
        Using device snapped border width to calculate inner/outer rectangles helps to maintain

        Remove unused ThreadSpecificInspectorCounters.
        <https://webkit.org/b/129337>

        We were keeping count of all the JS event listeners in every thread
        to support an old Chromium feature that's no longer relevant.

        Removing this gets rid of expensive thread-local storage lookups.

        [CSS Grid Layout] handle undefined RemainingSpace in computeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks algorithm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128372

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        From Blink r165692 by <svillar@igalia.com>

        The spec defines a different code path for the computeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks algorithm
        http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/#function-ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks.

        Basically the track breadth is different when the available size is undefined and thus,
        cannot be taken into account during the computations.
        The available size is undefined whenever the height is auto or the grid element has a
        shrink-to-fit behavior.

        It was also renamed the function to match the specs so the function name starts with
        'compute' instead of 'computed'.

        No new tests, but added new cases to some of them.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The painting of the region's layer should not be aborted so early if the region's fragment shouldn't be painted
        because that would prevent all the layer's children from being painted.

        Another problem this patch addresses is that clipping should also be performed when the clip rect is empty,
        which is what happens when painting in a tile in which the flowed element would normally be painted
        if it wasn't clipped by the region.

        The declaration of TreeScope::getElementById() was taking an AtomicString as the parameter.
        Because of this, all the call sites manipulating String were creating and keeping alive an AtomicString
        to make the call.

        This had two negative consequences:
        -The call sites were ref-ing the ID's atomic string for no reason.
        -When there is no ID associated with the input string, an atomic string was created for the sole
         purpose of failing the query. Since IDs are stored as AtomicString, if there is not an existing

        'mouseenter' mouse compat event not fired when listeners for touch events

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The code dispatching mouseenter and mouseleave events was making the assumption that
        only mouse move would cause Document::updateHoverActiveState.

        This is not true in some cases. In the case of this bug, the first touch handler sets
        the hover state. From there, the code handling enter/leave is in an inconsistent state.

        This patch changes the delivery of mouse enter/leave events to be done through the regular
        processing of mouse events. The update is done with the mouseover and mouseout events.

        [CSS Regions] Regions don't paint correctly in new-multicol elements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120711

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch implements basic support for regions inside multi-column elements.
        Currently, the painting and hit-testing logic of CSS Regions is not aware of
        enclosing multi-column elements. The change is integrated at a layer level by
        making use of the pre-computed layer fragments during the painting and hit-testing
        phases for regions.

        There are limitations such that self painting layers found inside the named flow
        thread layer will not be correctly processed because they don't go through the
        layer fragment collection step. This is not trivial to implement because the enclosing
        pagination layer provided by the multi-column element is not visibile from inside
        the named flow thread layer and they reside in different coordinate systems.

        A side effect of this patch is the fix of regions incorrect clipping in certain
        cases (when both a region and its container clip their overflow, the region's
        content is visible outside the container).

        m_ancestorDisabledState should never be unknown
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129084

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        In order to resolve the bug 129035, a text form control elements needs to synchronously change
        its inner text element's editability by setting or unsetting contenteditable content attribute.
        Before this patch, we could not do this because editability of a text form control dependent on
        its disabled-ness which was only computed lazily via updateAncestorDisabledState().

        This patch makes HTMLFieldSetElement and HTMLFormControlElement update this state synchronously.
        To avoid O(k) DOM traversal, where k is the depth of the tree, in insertedInto and removedFrom of
        HTMLFormControlElement on most pages, a new document-level flag, m_disabledFieldsetElementsCount,
        has been added to indicate whether the document contains any disabled fieldset or not.

        Also renamed the misleadingly named disabledAttributeChanged to disabledStateChanged, and added
        new function of the same name (disabledAttributeChanged) to be used by HTMLFieldSetElement
        for keeping the document-level flag up-to-date upon disabled attribute changes.

        Tests: fast/forms/fieldset/fieldset-disabled-2.html

        * dom/Document.cpp:

        its descendants' ancestor disabled flag. We don't update controls under another disabled
        fieldset element since disabled-ness of those controls aren't affected by startNode.

        (WebCore::HTMLFieldSetElement::disabledAttributeChanged): Call addDisabledFieldsetElement and
        removeDisabledFieldsetElement to update the owner document's flag.

        (WebCore::HTMLFieldSetElement::disabledStateChanged): Renamed from disabledAttributeChanged.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::disabledAttributeChanged): Added. Calls disabledStateChanged.
        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::disabledStateChanged): Renamed from disabledAttributeChanged.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::insertedInto): Update m_disabledByAncestorFieldset if there is
        a possibility (i.e. the document contains any disabled fieldset element) that this form control
        is inserted under a disabled fieldset element.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::removedFrom): If this form control element is not disabled by
        a fieldset ancestor, then there is nothing to do. If it is, then check to see if the element is
        still disabled now that we've lost some ancestors.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::isDisabledFormControl): No longer updates m_ancestorDisabledState
