        Note in particular that the previous PLATFORM(MAC) check was wrong here, as that is never
        true for GTK; this patch risks changing it to OS(MAC_OS_X), on the hope that advertising Mac
        when running on Mac might not break anything. If it does, then we should remove it and just
        always pretend to be on X11.

        For composited state changes when the layers don't need rebuilding, the updateGeometry() traversal
        is post-order (see webkit.org/162634), so we can't rely on the offsetfromRenderer() value when
        computing the graphics layer position on the descendants. We need this workaround until after webkit.org/162634
        gets fixed.

        Move caching the ImageFrame from BitmapImage to ImageSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155498

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        BitmapImage has two modes of operation regarding its image decoding state.
        The first mode happens when a remote image is loaded as encoded data and
        which requires an ImageDecoder to generate the image metadata and the
        the ImageFrames. The second mode happens when a BitmapImage is created
        with a NativeImagePtr. In this case, no ImageDecoder is needed.

        To remove this burden from the BitmapImage the member 'm_frames' is removed
        from BitmapImage. A new member named 'm_frameCache' of type ImageFrameCache
        is added to ImageSource. This class handles caching and recaching the image
        metadata and the ImageFrames if the image needs decoding. When the BitmapImage
        is initialized with a memory image, the ImageFrameCache initializes its
        metadata and ImageFrames directly from the NativeImagePtr.

        The plan for ImageFrameCache is to be extended for the asynchronous image
        decoding and also to be used by the non CG image decoders which cache
        other copies of the ImageFrames. This double caching should be removed.

        When the BitmapImage is replying to the ImageFrame queries, it will ask the
        ImageSource which will pass the query the ImageFrameCache. ImageFrameCache
        will ensure the requested ImageFrame is cached and is valid for the requested
        SubSamplingLevel before accessing the data members of this ImageFrame.

        We now completely ignore the "download" attribute on anchors if the

        of forcefully downloading it in this case and leave it up to the server
        to give us the right headers if it should be downloaded. This is
        conservative and matches Firefox.

        Chrome and the HTML specification ignore only the suggested filename
        if the URL is cross-origin but still download the file.

        It should be possible to dispatch events on documents that do not have a browsing
        context (e.g. Documents created using DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument()).
        Gecko and Blink both allow this but WebKit did not.

        The approach chosen to support this is similar to the one in Blink. When constructing
        a new document (e.g. using DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument()) we now keep track
        of the context document. When requesting the scriptExecutionContext(), we now return
        the context document if the document has one instead of the document itself.

        Implement URLParser::syntaxViolation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162593

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Most of the time when parsing URLs, we just look at the URL, find offsets of the host, path, query, etc., 
        and the String can be used untouched.  When this happens, we do not want to allocate and copy the String.
        We want to just add a reference to an existing String.

        Sometimes we need to canonicalize the String because there has been a syntaxViolation,
        defined as any String that is different than its canonicalized URL String.  In such cases we need to
        allocate a new String and fill it with the canonicalized URL String.  When a syntaxViolation happens for the
        first time, we know that everything in the input String up to that point is equal to what it would have been
        if we had canonicalized the beginning of the URL, copy it into a buffer, and continue parsing in a mode where
        instead of just looking at the input URL String, we canonicalize each code point into the buffer.

        Changes to behavior involve additional spec compliance with tabs and newlines in different places in URLs,
        as well as additional spec compliance when parsing empty and null URLs relative to other URLs.
        Both are covered by new API tests. Existing behavior covered by existing API tests.

        This is about a 15% speed improvement on my URL parsing benchmark.

        - Remove the strict requirement for audio to be actively playing for the session to be able to show
          controls for the purpose of Now Playing, making it the same as our policy for the controls manager.
        - Make playback requirement restrictions apply only for the controls manager. Videos that do not
          autoplay will still have the correct behavior with respect to Now Playing, since we will bail in the
          hasEverNotifiedAboutPlaying() check.
        - Only consider the main content heuristic as preventing media controls from showing up for the purposes
          of the controls manager. Now Playing should instead account for this by preferring elements large
          enough for main content after collecting all of the candidate sessions.

        Firefox agrees with the specification. There is no real behavior change
        except that MutationObserver.prototype.observe.length is now 1 instead
        of 2. Passing only one parameter will still throw a TypeError because
        the Dictionary is empty. However, this parameter needs to be marked as
        optional because Web IDL requires the last parameter to be optional if

        should not show controls, since we relax audio and video constraints for showing videos in the controls manager,
        so that a video element is prevented from showing controls on grounds of lacking audio only if it has never had
        audio before. In the case of Now Playing, we have stricter requirements for videos, which must have audio, which
        makes the mainframe heuristic not necessary.

        There is a bug in ComposedTreeIterator. If the iterator is initialized with an initial state where the root

        If an input element is in a shadow tree it generates narrowly scoped style updates. When RenderTreeUpdater
        applies such an update the update root will be inside the shadow tree and the bug will prevent the render tree

        Seeking video doesn't update seek position
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162575
        <rdar://problem/28457219>

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        On ToT, seeking in a video causes the playhead to stutter, and does not actually update media remote's seek
        position. This is partly due to how we do not update media remote with new information when beginning to respond
        to remote seek commands, so media remote continues to think that a playing video is still playing despite the
        user attempting to seek through it.

        To fix this, we introduce timer-based guards around remote seek commands, such that a seek "gesture" begins when
        we receive the first seek command and ends when no seek command has been received in a set amount of time (this
        is 0.5 seconds, which is approximately what other clients around the platform use).

        Also, when responding to a remote seek, perform the seek with no tolerance. This prevents the playhead from
        stuttering at the end of a seek from the final requested destination of the seek to the last actually seeked
        time in the video.

        When beginning to seek, we must pause the media. Through existing mechanisms, this causes the media session
        manager to update its Now Playing information, which informs media remote that we are no longer playing and
        prevents us from stuttering. However, when ending a seek, we must also trigger an additional update to again
        refresh media remote's view of the current time. This prevents a flicker when playing media after seeking.

        Unit tests to be added in a follow-up due to time constraints.

        No new tests because this patch is mostly refactoring.  The only change in
        behavior is that functions that have a JSValue return type will now return the
        empty JSValue when an exception is thrown.  I tested this behavior by running
        the existing JSC and layout tests.
