        Add very basic image control rendering

        This patch is groundwork that adds a very basic image control that can render on top of images.

        * dom/Node.h:
        (WebCore::Node:: isImageControlsRootElement): Returns false, unless you are an ImageControls object.
        * html/HTMLAttributeNames.in:

        Teach HTMLImageElement how to understand an experimental attribute to install controls,
        how to actually build the DOM to attach to the shadow root, how to tear that DOM down,
        and how to make sure that Renderers are created for that DOM:
        * html/HTMLImageElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::HTMLImageElement):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::parseAttribute):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::didAttachRenderers):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::updateImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::createImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::destroyImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::hasImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::childShouldCreateRenderer):
        * html/HTMLImageElement.h:
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::hasShadowControls): For RenderImage to query when it is constructed. 

        Add a generic, platform independent ImageControls root element that does nothing:
        * html/shadow/ImageControlsRootElement.cpp: Added.
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::maybeCreate):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::ImageControlsRootElement):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::~ImageControlsRootElement):
        * html/shadow/ImageControlsRootElement.h: Added.

        Add a Mac-specific ImageControls root element that renders a 20x20 red box (for now):
        * html/shadow/mac/ImageControlsRootElementMac.cpp: Added.
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElementMac::ImageControlsRootElementMac):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElementMac::~ImageControlsRootElementMac):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::maybeCreate):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElementMac::maybeCreate):
        * html/shadow/mac/ImageControlsRootElementMac.h: Added.

        Since much of the RenderMedia::layout() method is now required for RenderImage as well,
        move the logic to RenderImage. The extra work is controlled by a bool flag that will always
        be set for RenderMedias but will only be set for certain RenderImages:
        * rendering/RenderImage.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderImage::RenderImage):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::canHaveChildren):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::layout):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::layoutShadowControls):
        * rendering/RenderImage.h:
        (WebCore::RenderImage::setHasShadowControls):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::shadowControlsNeedCustomLayoutMetrics):

        * rendering/RenderMedia.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderMedia::RenderMedia):
        * rendering/RenderMedia.h:
        (WebCore::RenderMedia::shadowControlsNeedCustomLayoutMetrics):

        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
