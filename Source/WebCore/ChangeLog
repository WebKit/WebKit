    [macOS] Copying a table from the Numbers app and pasting into iCloud Numbers fails

    Source/WebCore:
    
    After r222656, WebKit now treats raw image data on the pasteboard as files for the purposes of computing
    DataTransfer.files and DataTransfer.types. However, this is combined with existing policies that suppress
    DataTransfer.getData and DataTransfer.setData when the pasteboard contains files (generalized to copy/paste in
    r222688). This means we now don't allow web pages to access "text/plain" in the case where the user copies part
    of a table from the native Numbers app since Numbers additionally writes a snapshot of the table to the platform
    pasteboard.
    
    This restriction on getData/setData was intended to prevent web pages from extracting users' file paths when
    pasting or dropping, so it doesn't make sense to enforce this restriction even when there is only in-memory
    image data on the pasteboard. To fix this bug, we make Pasteboard::fileContentState() differentiate between
    cases where there are (real) files on the pasteboard, and cases where we've fallen back to treating image data

    REGRESSION(r225868): Release assert when removing an SVGUseElement from Document::m_svgUseElements
    https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182188
    <rdar://problem/36689240>
    
    Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.
    
    Fixed the crash by removing up the release assert.
    
    The crash is likely caused by re-entrancy to Document::resolveStyle during SVGUseElement::updateShadowTree.
    Because Document::resolveStyle invokes updateShadowTree on SVG use elements in Document::m_svgUseElements
    without clearing the map, the nested call to resolveStyle ends up calling updateShadowTree() for all elements
    in m_svgUseElements and removing them all from the map. When the stack frame eventually comes back to the outer
    invocation of Document::resolveStyle, updateShadowTree gets invoked for the second time on SVG use elements
    whose shadow tree had already been updated within the inner invocation to updateShadowTree, and release-asserts.

            REGRESSION(r225868): Release assert when removing an SVGUseElement from Document::m_svgUseElements

            Fixed the crash by removing up the release assert.

            The crash is likely caused by re-entrancy to Document::resolveStyle during SVGUseElement::updateShadowTree.
            Because Document::resolveStyle invokes updateShadowTree on SVG use elements in Document::m_svgUseElements
            without clearing the map, the nested call to resolveStyle ends up calling updateShadowTree() for all elements
            in m_svgUseElements and removing them all from the map. When the stack frame eventually comes back to the outer
            invocation of Document::resolveStyle, updateShadowTree gets invoked for the second time on SVG use elements
            whose shadow tree had already been updated within the inner invocation to updateShadowTree, and release-asserts.

            There is an alternative fix: avoid calling updateShadowTree on a svg element when shadowTreeNeedsUpdate returns
            true on the element in resolveStyle. However, removing the release assert is a sure way to fix the crash so

    (f):
    
    Source/JavaScriptCore:
    
    Fixing this requires getting the ParserError (with information about the failure) and an ExecState* (to throw an exception) in the same place.
    It is surprisingly painful, with quite a long call stack between the last function with an access to an ExecState* and the first function with the ParserError.
    Even worse, many of these functions are generated by macros, themselves generated by a maze of python scripts.
    As a result, this patch is grotesquely large, while all it does is adding enough plumbing to throw a proper exception in this specific case.
    
    There are now bare calls to '.value()' on several paths that may crash. It is not a problem in my opinion, since we previously crashed in every case regardless of the path that took us to createExecutable when encountering a stack overflow.
    If we ever find an example that can cause these calls to fail, it should be doable to throw a proper exception there too.
    
    Two other minor changes:
    - I removed BuiltinExecutableCreator.{cpp, h} as it was nearly empty, and only used in one place. That place now includes BuiltinExecutables.h directly instead.
    - I moved code from ParserError.h into a newly created ParserError.cpp, as I see no need to inline functions that are only used when encountering a parser error, and ParserError.h is now included in quite a few places.

            [Mac] Teach WebCore::Pasteboard about file promise drags
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183314
            <rdar://problem/38105493>

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            While WebKit does support receiving file promise drags (since r210360), WebCore::Pasteboard
            has not been instructed on how to read their file paths. When the various pasteboard readers
            ask for file paths after a file promise drop, they receive an empty vector. This impacts
            various features, most notably the DataTransfer API.

            Pasteboard actually cannot learn about promised file paths from the pasteboard itself, as
            the pasteboard only contains the dragged files' UTIs. Promised file paths aren't known until
            the WebKits call -[NSFilePromiseReceiver receivePromisedFilesAtDestination:...], at which
            point the file paths are passed to WebCore as part of WebCore::DragData.

            When we construct new Pasteboards for drag and drop, we need to store any promised file
            paths from the DragData. Then, when the various pasteboard readers ask for file paths and
            NSFilesPromisePboardType is on the pasteboard, we can return these promised file paths.

            the previously computed values even when some part of the tree is dirty.
            In case of shadow content, updateLayoutIfDimensionsOutOfDate() might return false (no need to layout)
            for the root, while true (needs layout) for the shadow content.
            This could confuse the caller (Element::scrollWidth/Height etc) and lead to incorrect result.

            Accessibility is doing too much work when handling attribute changes. Here's how we can improve this:
               1) Defer attribute changes while the tree is dirty (and coalesce them).
               2) Don't create AXObjects when an attribute changes unnecessarily. If no client has requested an ax object, it's likely no work needs to be done
                     (with the exception of a few attributes like aria-modal)
               3) Stop calculating the entire accessible ARIA label when trying to decide if an element should be ignored. That's generally wasteful and the
                     consequence of including more AX elements in the tree is very minimal.

            SessionID::defaultSessionID() was hardcoded in the ServiceWorkerThread constructor

            As a result, when the Service Worker would establish a SWClientConnection to the

            SecurityOrigin objects are constructed on various threads. However, someone added a
            shouldTreatAsPotentiallyTrustworthy() call to the SecurityOrigin constructor which
            was not thread safe. This is because this function relies on SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure()
            and SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal() which were relying on global static HashMaps without
            locks.

            Update SecurityOrigin to initialize m_isPotentiallyTrustworthy lazily, to avoid paying
            initialization cost in the constructor. This is only queries by SecurityContext::isSecureContext().

            Make SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal() and SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure()
            thread-safe, since they are needed to initialize SecurityOrigin::m_isPotentiallyTrustworthy from
            various threads.

            SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure() is only called from SecurityOrigin (which requires
            thread-safety), and getUserMedia() which is not hot code so the extra locking there should not
            be an issue.

            SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal() is called from SecurityOrigin (which requires thread-
            safety). It is also called from isQuickLookPreviewURL(), MHTMLArchive::create(), Page::userStyleSheetLocationChanged(),
            isRemoteWebArchive() and HTMLPlugInImageElement. All these are not hot code so I do not think
            we need a fast path.

            In the fix for webkit.org/b/182668, we made it so that when the "controls" attribute is absent from a media
            element we stop listening to the bulk of media events and prevent controls from updating any DOM properties
            so as to minimize the amount of CPU usage by the Web process.

            An unfortunate side effect was that, if the media controls were disabled at the time the video starts playing,
            the StartSupport class would thus not catch the "play" event and would not be able to set the "hasPlayed"
            property to "true" on the MediaController, which would then prevent the _shouldShowStartButton() from returning
            "false". As a result, if the "controls" attribute was turned back on after the media started playing, they
            would default to showing the start button, which would be then in the play state, ie. showing the pause icon.

            We now set the "hasPlayed" property in the "play" event handler on MediaController, which is always registered
            regardless of the "controls" attribute setting. We also ensure we invalidate the "showStartButton" property on
            the media controls when StartSupport is enabled, which is the case when the "controls" attribute is toggled back
            to "true" from a previous "false" value.

            Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

            The fix at r228708 was trying to address the fact that avplayer sometimes
            deallocates WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask objects on a non-main thread, which
            was not safe because its _resource data member needs to be deallocated on
            the main thread.

            The issue is that r228708 caused _resource to outlive its WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask.
            This is an issue because _resource has a client data member (of type WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTaskClient)
            which has a raw pointer to the WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask. This means that the main thread could
            call methods like responseReceived() on the resource, which would call responseReceived() on the
            client, which would try to call [WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask receivedResponse:] with an invalid
            m_task pointer.

            To address the issue, I introduced a clearTask() method on WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTaskClient, which
            gets called from a non-main thread to clear the client's m_task pointer when the task is destroyed
            on a non-main thread. So that this is safe, every time the client tries to use m_task, we now
            acquire a lock for thread-safety and do a null-check on m_task.

            The issue was caused by DOMMatrix attributes potentially returning "impure"
            NaN values. We would call JSC::jsNumber(double) to construct the JSValue
            but this is only safe for pure NaN values. Make sure we purify the double
            returned by the implementation for IDL attributes of type 'unrestricted double'
            before calling JSC::jsNumber(double).

                After r220865 refactored the iOS copy codepaths to use NSItemProviders, we stopped writing the URL as plain text
                to the pasteboard. However, this means clients that only check for "text/plain" (or one of its aliases) on the
                pasteboard won't read any data on paste.

                To fix this, we restore the pre-iOS 11.3 behavior of writing both the URL and plain text to the pasteboard.
                Since we're using item providers, we also ensure that the NSURL is at a higher fidelity than the string to make
                it clear that the data should be consumed as a URL.

                This patch also rebaselines an existing drag and drop test to cover this change, and adds a new API test,
                ActionSheetTests.CopyLinkWritesURLAndPlainText, which simulates copying a link using the share sheet and pasting

            Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

            Unfortunately, r228352 was inadaquate to fix copying & pasting of a list item from Microsoft Word into TinyMCE
            in older verions of TinyMCE. This patch amends the approach taken by r228352 to make it work across the board
            as well as unbreak GMail.

            Turns out older versions of TinyMCE can't handle list items when computed styles are added as inline style
            declarations by WebKit. To make this work, avoid adding any computed styles as inline styles within mso-list
            conditionals as well as any p elements whose style attribute contains "mso-list" property. We would instead
            preserve these styles by keeping Microsoft Word's CSS style rules in addition to special @list rules.

            In addition, not keeping the style element of Microsoft Word in a head element as done in r228352 causes some
            versions of TinyMCE to treat it as regular text, and inserting a bunch of @list rules as user visible text.
            To work around this problem, we serialize the style rules as a comment (<!-- ~ -->) within a head element.

            Furthermore, when Microsoft Word is in the compatibility mode, it does not generate xmlns:o as the first xmlns
            declaration. Generalized the code to detect Microsoft Word's HTML declaration by looking for xmlns:o and xmlns:w
            xmls declarations.

            Finally, it turns out that Gmail has its own handling of list items copy & pasted from Microsoft Word, and also
            needs this quirks but in the pasted HTML, not the one exposed in getData. As such, this patch also enables the
            MSO list quirks in the pasted content as well as the one exposed in getData.

            REGRESSION (r223440): Copying & pasting a list from Microsoft Word to TinyMCE fails
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182564

            Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

            Turns out that Microsoft Word generates p and span elements with special styles instead of standard
            ul and ol elements when copying a list items, and TinyMCE has a specialized code path to process
            this proprietary format of Microsoft Word. The regression was caused by WebKit's sanitization code
            stripping away these non-standard CSS rules and inline styles.

            To preseve pre-r223440 behavior in TinyMCE, we preserve the following in a HTML markup:

            1. The "html" element at the beginning with xmlns content attributes
            2. @list rules in a style element starting with "/* List Definitions */" comment
            3. inline style content attribute with "mso-list" property
            4. comments conditional sections with "[if !supportLists]" and "[endif]"

            (1) is needed for TinyMCE to trigger the specialized code path for Microsoft Word. (2) contains
            the information about the structure of list items. (3) is needed to associate each p element with
            a rule in (2). (4) is needed to strip away the content generated as list markers (e.g. dots).

            We enable this "MSO list quirks" when the content comes from a non-WebKit client or a WebKit client
            that doesn't enable custom pasteboard data (detected by the content origin being null), and the HTML
            markup starts with a specific sequence of characters generated by Microsoft Word.

            the inline style generated using the computed style since we would lose the inline styles of the text
            otherwise (e.g. red text and bold font). To workaround this, we generate two style content attributes,
            one containing computed styles and another one containing mso-list. Luckily, the HTML parsing algorithm
            dictates that the first attribute always wins when more than one attributes of the same name appears,
            so we place the computed style's style attribute first so that the pasted content in non-TinyMCE
            environment will continue to work.

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            Rework the fix for r228299 to be more targeted. I moved the policy check
            cencelation from FrameLoader::stopLoading() to NavigationScheduler::schedule()
            when a pending load is cancelled by another load. I have verified that the
            sites fixed by r228299 still work with this more limited change. However,
            reader mode is now working again.

            The issue seems to be that we tell CFNetwork to continue with the load after
            receiving the response, even if the client has not responded to the
            decidePolicyForNavigationResponse delegate yet. As a result, CFNetwork sends
            us the resource data and we may commit the provisional load before receiving
            the policy response from the client. When the provisional load is committed,
            we call FrameLoader::stopLoading() which after r228299 cancelled pending
            policy checks. Because we did not wait for the policy check response to
            commit the load, we would cancel it which would make the load fail.

            The real fix here would be to make not tell CFNetwork to continue until after
            we've received the policy delegate response. However, this is a larger and
            riskier change at this point. I will follow-up on this issue.

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            After r222656, we treat images on the pasteboard as files. However, we also have an existing policy which hides
            text data ("text/uri-list", "text/html", "text/plain") from the page when files are present on the pasteboard.
            When copying a table, Microsoft Excel writes a rendering of the table to the pasteboard as an image. This means
            that we'll hide other data types (importantly, 'text/html') upon pasting, even though important clients (such as
            Google Docs and Confluence) depend on the 'text/html' data in order to correctly handle the paste (rather than
            paste as an image of a table).

            To fix this, we add an exception to the DataTransfer.getData codepath when the pasteboard contains files.
            Instead of always returning the empty string for text/html, we still allow pasteboard access, but only read
            from a limited set of rich text types, i.e. web archive, RTF(D), and HTML markup. Importantly, this prevents
            us from exposing any file paths that appear as plain text or URLs on the pasteboard. Just as in the regular
            codepath for getData(), if the pasteboard data comes from the same origin, we allow unsanitized access;
            otherwise, we use WebContentMarkupReader to extract markup from the pasteboard.

            Tests:  PasteMixedContent.ImageFileAndPlainText
                    PasteMixedContent.ImageFileAndWebArchive
                    PasteMixedContent.ImageFileAndHTML

            Also rebaselined some layout tests, which cover changes in behavior when dropping on macOS and pasting on iOS.

            (WebCore::DataTransfer::readStringFromPasteboard const):

            Factor out logic for reading from the pasteboard into a private helper. This is called in two places from
            getDataForItem: in the normal (existing) path, and in the case where we allow 'text/html' to be read despite
            files appearing in the pasteboard.

            One important difference here is that this helper now takes a WebContentReadingPolicy, whose purpose is to
            prevent reading from non-rich-text types when files appear in the pasteboard.

            Another tweak here is that we now use `lowercaseType` instead of the original (unadjusted) `type` when reading
            from the pasteboard. This doesn't seem to be intended in the first place.

            (::AnyType), but when files appear on the pasteboard, we force OnlyRichTextTypes to ensure that no other types
            can unintentionally be read back as web content.

            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182631

            Reviewed by Mark Lam.

            PaymentRequest::canMakePayment() needs to parse each payment method's serialized data to
            determine if it is a supported payment method. If parsing fails by raising an exception, we
            intend to skip over that payment method and try the next one. If all payment method data
            fail to parse, we resolve the returned promise with false. At no point do we intend to
            propagate the parsing exception up to the calling script, however.

            Even though we intend to swallow any exceptions from parsing, we failed to clear the
            JavaScript VM's exception state. The next time WebCore tries to execute JavaScript, a
            release assertion is raised due to seeing an unexpected exception in the VM.

            Fix this by using a CatchScope in PaymentRequest::canMakePayment(), and calling
            CatchScope::clearException() in the places we intend to swallow exceptions.

            Reverts unintended changes in <http://trac.webkit.org/r226396>. Before r226396, WebContentReader::readFilenames
            (a helper function in macOS-specific code) contained logic to create and insert attachment elements if
            ENABLE(ATTACHMENT_ELEMENT); otherwise, it would fall back to inserting the visible URL as a text node. Since we
            enable the attachment element on all Cocoa platforms via xcconfig files, this was effectively dead code.

            However, when r226396 (which moved this out from macOS to Cocoa platform code) refactored this helper function,
            it also moved this chunk of code out of the !ENABLE(ATTACHMENT) conditional and into a PLATFORM(MAC) guard,
            which means that we now fall back to inserting file paths as text when attachment elements are disabled. To fix
            this, we simply remove the (previously) dead code.

            A more subtle difference is that we no longer always return true from WebContentReader::readFilePaths. This
            means that when we drop files, we no longer skip over the early return in documentFragmentFromDragData when
            we've made a fragment, so we read the file path as a URL. To address this, we just restore the pre-macOS 10.13.4
            behavior of initializing the document fragment.

            [WebIDL] Support optional Promise arguments
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182399
            <rdar://problem/36754552>

            Previously, declaring a Promise argument as optional would result in a native type of
            std::optional<RefPtr<DOMPromise>>. This is wasteful, since RefPtr can represent an optional
            argument by storing nullptr. Further, PassArgumentExpression() assumed Promises were never
            optional and tried to pass the argument as a Ref by calling RefPtr::releaseNonNull().

            This patch removes the std::optional wrapper around optional Promises and simply passes the
            promise as a RefPtr to native code.

            The bug was caused by the fact it's not always safe to invoke updateLayout even when isSafeToUpdateStyleOrLayout
            on a document of a flattened frame on iOS. isSafeToUpdateStyleOrLayout returns true when the frame view is in
            the frame-flattening mode to avoid hitting a release asssertion in updateLayout of the frame. However, it's still
            not safe to invoke updateLayout on a parent frame in this case.

            As a result, inlineVideoFrame (in Source/WebKit/WebProcess/cocoa/VideoFullscreenManager.mm) invokes updateLayout
            even when the top-level document is not safe to update when the video element is in a frame-flattened document.

            Fixed this bug by explicitly checking that we still have a live render tree and document hasn't been stopped.
            Also replaced other uses of isSafeToUpdateStyleOrLayout by more explicit checks.

            I found out that this test was flakily timing out because our jobQueues would sometimes get stuck
            when their current job's connection or service worker (when scheduled by a service worker) would
            go away before the job is complete.

            This patch makes our job queues operation more robust by:
            1. Cancelling all jobs from a given connection when a SWServerConnection goes away
            2. Cancelling all jobs from a given service worker when a service worker gets terminated

            We also make sure service workers created by a job get properly terminated when a job
            is canceled to avoid leaving service workers in limbo.

            No new tests, unskipped existing flaky test.

            On trunk, we currently have a release assert that asserts that scripts are allowed when calling
            FrameLoader::stopAllLoaders. This is correct since stopAllLoaders might dispatch events. We should
            continue to have the release assert in trunk, because we should catch when this happens. However,
            there still might be cases where the assert fails, but the backtrace will turn out to be one where
            scripting could be allowed. The release assert in trunk will help us catch these cases. On the
            branch, however, we should avoid crashing in these cases, and replace the release assert with a
            debug assert. If approved, this patch should only land on a branch, not on trunk.

            If an app manifest doesn't specify a scope, we should default to the "parent directory" of
            the start URL, rather than leaving the app unbounded. This is more reasonable than using the
            entire internet as the app scope.

            that were outside the layout viewport.

            When a frame element is moved in the DOM tree during the execution of a beforeunload handler,
            the frame will be detached when removed from its previous position in the DOM tree. When being
            detached, an attempt will also be made to stop the load by calling FrameLoader::stopAllLoaders().
            However, this method will return early when executed in a beforeunload handler, since navigation
            is not allowed then. The end result is a detached frame which will continue to load, and hitting
            asserts in DocumentLoader::dataReceived(), and DocumentLoader::notifyFinished(). It should be
            possible to stop a frame load, even when executing a beforeunload handler.

            We now initialize the registrations' active worker as soon as we load

            identifier yet at this point so I made it optional on the SWServerWorker.
            This identifier gets set on the SWServerWorker when the worker is actually

            My fix for YouTube360 changed the way we composite WebGL on macOS. Unfortunately it dropped

            testing on a Wide Gamut display, and explicitly setting the color profile, an automated
            test won't pick up this regression. I could add an Internals helper to query the colorspace

            Observe that HTMLFormElement::associatedElements returns a const reference to a Vector of raw
            FormAssociatedElement pointers. In various call sites that iterate through these associated elements using this
            function, some require synchronous layout updates per iteration, which can lead to a bad time when combined with
            the first observation.

            To address this, we introduce HTMLFormElement::copyAssociatedElementsVector. This returns a new vector
            containing strong Refs to each associated element. From each call site that may trigger synchronous layout and
            execute arbitrary script while iterating over associated form elements, we instead use iterate over protected
            FormAssociatedElements.

            From each call site that currently doesn't (and shouldn't) require a layout update, we use the old version that
            returns a list of raw FormAssociatedElement pointers, but add ScriptDisallowedScopes to ensure that we never
            execute script there in the future.

            The bug was caused by WebContentReader::readHTML and WebContentMarkupReader::readHTML not sanitizing plain HTML string
            as done for web archives even when custom pasteboard data is enabled. Fixed the bug by doing the sanitization.

            Unfortunately, we can't make file URLs available in this case because WebContent process doesn't have sandbox extensions
            to access local files referenced by the HTML source in the clipboard, and we can't make WebContent process request for
            a sandbox extension¸on an arbitrary local file, as it would defeat the whole point of sandboxing.

            Instead, we strip away all HTML attributes referencing a URL whose scheme is not HTTP, HTTPS, or data when sanitizing
            text/html from the clipboard to avoid exposing local file paths, which can reveal privacy & security sensitive data
            such as the user's full name, and the location of private containers of other applications in the system.

            Do not paint synchronously when popup items have been added or changed while the popup is visible.
            If new popup items have been added after the popup was shown, a synchronous paint operation will
            possibly access their style before it is ready, leading to a null pointer crash. The invalidated
            area will be painted asynchronously.

            No new tests. To reproduce this crash, it is necessary to open a popup with JavaScript, add new
            popup items, and then end the test. Opening the popup can be done by sending a mousedown event
            with the eventsender. However, on Windows the mousedown event is sent synchronously, and will
            block as long as the popup is open and running the popup event loop. This means no JS can be
            executed until the popup is closed, causing the test to always time out before new popup items
            can be added. I have verified the fix with a manual test case.

              possibly revive it.
            - You can GC a MessagePort, even if it has a message handler, as long as there are no messages
              in flight between it and the remote port, and as long as the remote port is "maybe eligible for GC."

            A MessagePort is considered "maybe eligible for GC" once hasPendingActivity is asked once.

            A MessagePort loses "maybe eligible for GC" status once it is used for sending or receiving a message.

            The changes to MessagePort.cpp implement the above with a tiny little bool-driven state machine.

            Refactor to use the same FetchResponse::create for Cache API and cloning.
            In this method, ensure that response and headers are filtered correctly according response tainting.
            Make also sure that synthetic responses do not get filtered (not needed since created by JavaScript).

            Introduce helper routine to set the header map of a resource response.
            Use this routine when cloning a synthetic response as in that case, m_internalResponse has no header at all.

            For subresource loads, redirections will not change who is in charge of continuing the load (service worker or network process).
            For navigation loads, we need to match the registration for every redirection since this is using the Manual redirect mode.
            This allows starting the load with a service worker and finishing the load with another service worker, which will become the controller.

            Implement this by wrapping the registration matching of an URL within DocumentLoader::matchRegistration.
            Use that method in DocumentLoader::redirectReceived.

            Make in-process MessagePorts be (mostly) asynchronous
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181454

            Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

            No new tests (Covered *brutally* by existing tests)

            Part of making MessagePorts be a thing we can pass across processes is making them work async.

            The existing "MessagePortChannel" method of abstraction was not cut out for this.
            This patch gets rid of MessagePortChannel and adds a new MessagePortChannelProvider abstraction.
            It then gets the new machinery working in-process (with some pieces of out-of-process in place)

            One synchronous behavior this patch maintains is the hasPendingActivity() check used to support GC.
            That will (creatively) be made async in the next followup.

            More generally from MessagePorts, this patch also adds a "MessageWithMessagePorts" object to be used
            with all forms of postMessage(). Much better.

            The crash was caused by an erroneous instantiation of ScriptDisallowedScope::InMainThread in CachedPage::restore.
            It can execute arbitrary scripts since CachedFrame::open can update style, layout, and evaluate media queries.

            This is fine because there is no way to put this page back into a page cache until the load is commited via
            FrameLoader::commitProvisionalLoad is invoked later which only happens after CachedPage::restore had exited.

            Also added a release assert to make sure this condition holds.

            REGRESSION (macOS 10.13.2): imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/media-source/mediasource-* LayoutTests failing
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181891

            Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

            In macOS 10.13.2, CoreMedia changed the definition of CMSampleBufferGetDuration() to return
            the presentation duration rather than the decode duration. For media streams where those two
            durations are identical (or at least, closely similar), this isn't a problem. But the media
            file used in the WPT tests have an unusual frame cadence: decode durations go {3000, 1, 5999,
            1, 5999,...} and presentation durations go {3000, 2999, 3000, 2999}. This caused one check in
            the "Coded Frame Processing" algorithm to begin failing, where it checks that the delta
            between the last sample's decode time and the new decode time is no more than 2x as far as
            the last sample's duration. That's not a problem as long as the "duration" is the "decode
            duration" and the samples are all adjacent. Once the "duration" is "presentation duration",
            all the assumptions in the algorithm are invalidated. In the WPT test case, the delta between
            decode times is 5999, and 2 * the presentation duration is 5998, causing all samples up to
            the next sync sample to be dropped.

            To work around this change in behavior, we'll adopt the same technique used by Mozilla's MSE
            implementation, which was done for similar reasons. Rather than track the "last frame duration",
            we'll record the "greatest frame duration", and use actual decode timestamps to derive this
            duration. The "greatest frame duration" field will be reset at the same times as "last frame
            duration", and will be used only in the part of the algorithm that checks for large decode
            timestamp gaps.

            [Apple Pay] Stop eagerly loading PassKit.framework
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181911
            <rdar://problem/36555369>

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            r226458 and r226123 added code that caused PassKit.framework to be eagerly loaded when
            initializing a WKWebView. This is costly and should only be done when Apple Pay is first used.

            To avoid eagerly loading PassKit, this patch does two things:

            1. Instead of sending the available payment networks as part of WebPageCreationParameters,
            PaymentCoordinator asks for them using a syncrhonous message the first time they are needed.
            2. Instead of setting the Apple Pay preference to false when PassKit can't be loaded,
            the following API entry points check for a missing PassKit and return false, or throw
            exceptions, or reject promises:
                - ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()
                - ApplePaySession.canMakePaymentsWithActiveCard()
                - ApplePaySession.openPaymentSetup()
                - ApplePaySession.begin()

            No new tests for (1), which causes no change in behavior. (2) was manually verified by
            locally moving aside PassKit.framework, but that's not possible to do in an automated test.

            [macOS] [WK2] Drag location is computed incorrectly when dragging content from subframes
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181896
            <rdar://problem/35479043>

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            In r218837, I packaged most of the information needed to start a drag into DragItem, which is propagated to the client layer
            via the startDrag codepath. However, this introduced a bug in computing the event position and drag location in window
            coordinates. Consider the case where we're determining the drag image offset for a dragged element in a subframe:

            Before the patch, the drag location (which starts out in the subframe's content coordinates) would be converted to root view
            coordinates, which would then be converted to mainframe content coordinates, which would then be converted to window coordinates
            using the mainframe's view. After the patch, we carry out the same math until the last step, where we erroneously use the
            _subframe's_ view to convert to window coordinates from content coordinates. This results in the position of the iframe relative
            to the mainframe being accounted for twice.

            To fix this, we simply use the main frame's view to convert from mainframe content coordinates to window coordinates while
            computing the drag location. As for the event position in window coordinates, this is currently unused by any codepath in WebKit,
            so we can just remove it altogether.

            Since this bug only affects drag and drop in the macOS WebKit2 port, there's currently no way to test this. I'll be using
            <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181898> to track adding test support for drag and drop on macOS WebKit2. Manually tested
            dragging in both WebKit1 and WebKit2 on macOS. dragLocationInWindowCoordinates isn't used at all for iOS drag and drop.

            There is a short period of time, early in the registration process where a

            installing/waiting/active slots yet. As a result, if a registration is cleared
            during this period (for e.g. due to the user clearing all website data), that
            SWServerWorker will not be terminated. We then hit assertion later on when this
            worker is trying to do things (like call skipWaiting).

            To address the issue, we now keep a reference this SWServerWorker on the
            registration, via a new SWServerRegistration::m_preInstallationWorker data member.
            When the registration is cleared, we now take care of terminating this worker.

            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181810
            <rdar://problem/36591711>

            The issue was that when restoring a registration from disk, we would not set its active worker right
            away. We only set it later in installContextData(). installContextData() is only called after we’ve
            launched the service worker process and established a connection to it.

            However, we would start processing jobs (such as registrations) before we’ve established the connection
            to the service worker process. SWServerJobQueue::runRegisterJob(), in order to reuse an existing
            registration checks the registration’s active worker has the right script URL. The issue was that when
            this code would execute, we may not have set the registration’s active service worker yet, in which case,
            we would update the existing registration instead of reusing it as-is.

            To address the issue, we now delay the processing of jobs until the connection to the service worker
            process has been established and we've installed all pending contexts via installContextData().

            Changed is covered by new API test.

            No observable behavior change.
            Instead of creating a connection to know whether there is a potential service worker,
            Ask the service worker provider that will use the connection if needed.
            Otherwise, it will use a default value provided by the UIProcess.

            Tested by cleaning all service workers and checking the computed value of the default value,

            Always specify the -[NSURL _title] to be either the title specified in a PasteboardImage's inner PasteboardURL,
            or if no title is specified, fall back to the user-visible URL string. This is because at least one internal
            client always tries to use the -_title property to determine the title of a pasted URL, or if none is specified,
            the -suggestedName. Since we need to set suggestedName to the preferred file name of the copied image and we
            don't want the suggested name to become the title of the link, we need to explicitly set the link title.

            In doing so, this patch also fixes a bug wherein we forget to set the _title of the NSURL we're registering to
            an NSItemProvider.

            'fetch' event may be sent to a service worker before its state is set to 'activated'

            'fetch' event may be sent to a service worker before its state is set to 'activated'.
            When the registration's active worker needs to intercept a load, and its state is 'activating',
            we queue the request to send the fetch event in SWServerWorker::m_whenActivatedHandlers.
            Once the SWServerWorker::setState() is called with 'activated' state, we then call the
            handlers in m_whenActivatedHandlers to make send the fetch event now that the worker is
            activated. The issue is that even though the worker is activated and its state was set to
            'activated' on Storage process side, we had not yet notified the ServiceWorker process
            of the service worker's new state yet.

            To address the issue, we now make sure that SWServerWorker::m_whenActivatedHandlers are
            called *after* we've sent the IPC to the ServiceWorker process to update the worker's
            state to 'activated'. Also, we now call ServiceWorkerFetch::dispatchFetchEvent()
            asynchronously in a postTask() as the service worker's state is also updated asynchronously
            in a postTask. This is as per specification [1], which says to "queue a task" to fire
            the fetch event.

            [1] https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#on-fetch-request-algorithm (step 18)

            No new tests, covered by imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/service-workers/service-worker/fetch-waits-for-activate.https.html
            which hits the new assertion without the fix.

            We need to match the specification exactly here or things will happen in the wrong
            order. In particular, things like "update registration state" and "update worker state"
            might happen *after* firing the fetch event, even though the IPC for "update registration/worker
            state" was sent before the "fire fetch event" one, because the code for updating a registration/
            worker state already queues a task, as per the specification.

            needs to be updated from SWServerRegistration::updateWorkerState() to SWServerWorker::setState().
            This way, we can make sure the IPC is sent *before* we call the m_whenActivatedHandlers handlers,
            as they may also send IPC to the Service Worker process, and we need to make sure this IPC happens
            after so that the service worker is in the right state.

            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179986

                <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/197967>
                <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/196670>

            A JS statement like this:
                var item = text.x.animVal.getItem(0);

            Creates the following C++ objects:
                SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff<SVGLengthListValues> for 'text.x'
                SVGListPropertyTearOff<SVGLengthListValues> for 'text.x.animVal'
                SVGPropertyTearOff<SVGLengthValue> for 'text.x.animVal.getItem(0)'

            If 'item' changes, the attribute 'x' of the element '<text>' will change
            as well. But this binding works only in one direction. If the attribute
            'x' of the element '<text>' changes, e.g.:

                text.setAttribute('x', '10,20,30');

            This will detach 'item' from the element <text> and any further changes
            in 'item' won't affect the attribute 'x' of element <text>.

            The one direction binding can only work if this chain of tear-off objects
            is kept connected. This is implemented by RefCounted back pointers from
            SVGPropertyTearOff and SVGListPropertyTearOff to SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff.

            The security crashes and the memory leaks are happening because of the
            raw forward pointers:
                -- SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff maintains raw pointers of type
                   SVGListPropertyTearOff for m_baseVal and m_animVal
                -- The m_wrappers and m_animatedWrappers of SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff
                   are vectors of raw pointer Vector<SVGLength*>

            To control the life cycle of the raw pointers, SVGListPropertyTearOff and
            SVGPropertyTearOff call SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff::propertyWillBeDeleted()
            to notify it they are going to be deleted. In propertyWillBeDeleted(), we
            clear the pointers so they are not used after being freed. This mechanism
            has been error-prone and we've never got it 100% right.

            The solution we need to adopt with SVG tear-off objects is the following:
                -- All the forward pointers should be weak pointers.
                -- All the back pointers should be ref pointers.

            This solution may not look intuitive but it solves the bugs and keeps the
            one direction binding. The forward weak pointers allows the tear-off
            objects to go aways if no reference from JS exists. The back ref pointers
            maintains the chain of objects and guarantees the correct binding.

            Data URL fonts split in the middle of an alphabet cause random letters to disappear
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175845
            <rdar://problem/33996578>

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            It is fairly common practice for a font foundry to split a font up into two files such that a semi-random
            half of the alphabet is present in one of the files, and the other half is present in the other file. This
            practice involves representing the files as data URLs, so as to minimize the time it takes to load them.

            Because resource loading is asynchronous (even for data URLs), it is possible today to get a paint after
            the first file is loaded but before the second file is loaded. Indeed, because of the way font fallback
            works, we will never start loading the second file until a layout has occurred with the first font.

            Because a site usually only uses this pattern for a handful of fonts, and I've never seen this pattern
            being used for CJK fonts, it isn't very expensive to opportunistically decode these data URLs eagerly.
            Using this method doesn't actually guarantee that the two fonts will load in between successive paints,
            but it at least makes this much more likely. This patch implements this strategy, along with a size
            threshold to make sure that we won't decode any super large data URLs when it isn't necessary.

            When decidePolicyForNavigationAction is responded to asynchronously during a client redirect,
            HistoryController::updateForRedirectWithLockedBackForwardList does not update the history because
            the document loader has not been marked as a client redirect because the FrameLoader only looks
            at its provisional document loader to mark it as a client redirect.  When decidePolicyForNavigationAction
            is responded to asynchronously, though, the FrameLoader's provisional document loader has moved to
            its policy document loader.  To get both asynchronous and synchronous cases, let's just mark the document
            loader as a client redirect whether it's the provisional or policy document loader.

            Because listening to "webkitplaybacktargetavailabilitychanged" events incurs some higher power usage on iOS,
            we only listen to such events when controls are visible to the user. In other words, the MediaControls need to
            have both "visible" set to "true" and "faded" set to "false". To support this, we add a delegate method on
            MediaControls such that it can tell the MediaController that the "visible" property changed. With this message,
            MediaController can inform its MediaControllerSupport objects that user visibility of the controls changed, which
            lets AirplaySupport disable itself when controls are no longer visible.

            font-display:fallback can cause a visual flash (which is supposed to be impossible)
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181374

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            A FontCascade represents an entire font-family fallback list, but sometimes we need to pull out a single
            representative font from the list to calculate things like line height. Previously, if the first item in
            the font-family list was in the middle of being downloaded, this representative font was hardcoded to be
            Times. However, when actually laying out and drawing the glyphs, we have logic to skip the interstitial
            Times if there are any installed fonts present in the font-family list (so you wouldn't ever actually
            see Times). This means that line height (among other things) was being calculated as if Times was used,
            but in reality, some other font from the font-family list was being used.

            Alone, this isn't a huge problem, but font-display:fallback makes a font transition between "timed out"
            and "failed," and when the font hits the failed state, the representative font skips over the cancelled
            item and hits the next item in the fallback list. This means that line heights will change, which causes
            a visual flash, even when font-display:fallback is specified.

            The solution is simply to educate the logic which identifies this representative font so that it
            understands what to do for currently-loading fonts.

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            Make the dispatching of resourcetimingbufferfull event asynchronous to avoid dispatching it
            synchronously during a style resolution when CachedResourceLoader::requestImage requests
            a previously loaded image.

            We now schedule a timer when the resource timing buffer becomes full, and dispatch the event
            when the timer fires. Meanwhile, we have a backup buffer to which additional resource timing
            entries would be added. Once the event is dispatched, we refill the buffer exposed to author
            scripts. When refilling the buffer results in it becoming full again, we keep repeating the
            process of firing resourcetimingbufferfull and re-filling the buffer until either we stop
            making progress (i.e. the script didn't increase the number of empty entires in the buffer)
            or the backup buffer (at the time we started this process) becomes empty.

            Also fixed a bug that we were firing resourcetimingbufferfull event when the last entry that
            fits within the buffer size was added instead of when an entry is being added to an already
            full buffer. To make this work, the patch introduces m_resourceTimingBufferFullFlag,
            representing the concept "resource timing buffer full" flag in the resource timing specification.

        [Cairo] Use isolated fill and stroke source containers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181386

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Generate fill and stroke source objects upon invocation of various Cairo
        operations, initializing necessary data from the GraphicsContextState
        object.

        Cairo::FillSource and Cairo::StrokeSource structs are introduced, both
        being default-constructible as well as providing a constructor that
        accepts a GraphicsContextState object from which the appropriate
        resources are created.

        The FillSource and StrokeSource objects are then passed to
        PlatformContextCairo's prepareForFilling() and prepareForStroking()
        methods. Here the helper prepareCairoContextSource() function is now
        invoked with cairo_pattern_t objects as pattern or gradient sources, or
        the source color if neither cairo_pattern_t object is specified.

        The FillSource and StrokeSource constructors mimic the previous behavior
        of prepareCairoContextSource(). In case the source is a Pattern object,
        a cairo_pattern_t object is created from that. In case of FillSource,
        we also retrieve pattern size, transform and repetition information. In
        case the source os a Gradient object, we create a 'base' cairo_pattern_t
        object for a completely opaque alpha channel. Additionally, if the alpha
        value on the state is not 1, we create an alpha-adjusted cairo_pattern_t
        that is potentially used for any filling or stroking operation that has
        to preserve transparency. If neither Pattern or Gradient objects are set
        on the GraphicsContextState, we default to the current fill or stroke
        color.

        Overall, there's no change in behavior, this is simply a refactoring
        that enables us to construct Cairo objects for filling and stroking
        sources at the time of Cairo operation dispatch, instead of pulling down
        GraphicsContextState deeper into the Cairo-specific code.

        No new tests -- no change in functionality.

        Added support for onLine by reusing a similar implementation as regular workers.
        Added ServiceWorkerInternals as an interface for an object exposed as self.internals in WTR.
        This object has currently one method to trigger change in the online/offline status.
        This allows writing a test for the onLine feature.

        Note that self.internals is inserted asynchronously after the script was evaluated.
        When writing a worker script using self.internals, one must make sure to use self.internals when initialized.
        online-worker.js for instance makes use of self.internals in a postMessage callback.

        [Cairo] Contain shadow blur requirement state in a separate object
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181380

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Instead of picking up the necessary state parameters from a
        GraphicsContextState object, store the necessary parameters in a helper
        ShadowBlurUsage struct. Mimicking the mustUseShadowBlur() function that
        is being removed, values of the shadow color, shadow blur, and shadow
        transform ignorance are stored there. Additionally, the required()
        method accepts a PlatformContextCairo object through which it can
        retrieve the current CTM and determine whether it's an identity, finally
        deciding whether shadow blur can or cannot be ignored.

        Goal of this change is to limit usage of GraphicsContextState directly
        in operations implemented inside the Cairo namespace. Instead, the
        state parameters should be passed directly, or an equivalent but limited
        state object should be constructed for invocation of such operations.

        This is likely only an intermediate solution. It's possible it will be
        replaced by a more complete shadow state struct that would be used for
        any operation that is required to draw shadows, if necessary.

        No new tests -- no change in functionality.

        No new tests. The only changed functionality that isn't covered
        by existing tests is cross-origin iframes in the same partition
        should be handled as already having access. This cannot be
        tested in layout tests since they don't support subdomains.

        This change does the following:
        - Changes function and message names to reflect how this feature
          was eventually implemented, i.e. access per frame.
        - Makes it explicit that the UI process is only involved in
          granting storage access and not removing storage access.
          The latter is done directly by the web process.
        - Simplifies the network process' entry map since only needs to
          be able to give access to one domain in one frame at a time.
          Access goes away on frame navigation so there can only be one
          domain at a time per frame. Also, the map now uses pageIDs as
          main keys to prepare for efficient access removal for all
          frames under a page.
        - Fixes a bug in so that a cross-origin iframe with the same
          partition as the top frame correctly is handled as already

        Web Inspector: Capture Element Screenshot looks fuzzy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175734
        <rdar://problem/33803377>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro and Simon Fraser.

        Screenshots taken by Web Inspector were being downscaled from the
        internal size to the logical size, causing them to be blurry when
        later upscaled to the internal size.

        Replace ScaleBehavior { Scaled, Unscaled } with PreserveResolution { No, Yes }.
        This is a lot less confusing to read both inside ImageBuffer and at its use sites.

        Remove unused CoordinateSystem argument for ImageBuffer::toDataURL,
        and replace it with PreserveResolution. Plumb PreserveResolution into toCFData
        so that PreserveResolution::Yes will preserve the internal size of
        the image buffer, just as it does in other methods that take PreserveResolution.

        At the use site in InspectorPageAgent, always request PreserveResolution::Yes snapshots
        when taking an element screenshot. For now, keep using downscaled (smaller)
        snapshots when capturing canvas previews, as the previews are not full-size.

        Floats can overhang multiple blocks (they are called intruding floats).
        Each block keeps track of such intruding floats. When an overhanging float box is destroyed,
        we need to deregister it from all those blocks. We do it by walking up the ancestor block chain
        and check if the parent (grandparent etc) block still contains this float. Once we find the topmost block, 
        we start deregistering it by traversing back on the descendant blocks.
        Normally we do it in RenderElement::takeChildInternal right before the box is getting detached.
        However in certain cases (like when the float's parent happens to be an anonymous wrapper)
        by the time we get to ::takeChildInternal the subtree is already detached and we can't access all the
        ancestors.
        This patch ensure that the floating box is still attached during de-registration.

        to investigate removing this altogether. Code for handling this plain text insertion of file paths on Mac was

        Teach the iOS Pasteboard to read web content using attachment elements, if enabled. There are two scenarios in
        which we would want to insert an attachment element:
        (1) The item provider uses a preferred presentation style of attachment, in which case we bail out of trying to
            handle the drop using the default mechanisms, and simply insert it as an attachment. We need this to deal
            with the case where we drop text or HTML files from the Files app, so that we don't try and insert the
            contents of the text or HTML as inline web content.
        (2) The item provider doesn't have a preferred attachment presentation style, but there's nothing WebKit would
            otherwise do with the dropped content, so insert an attachment element as a fallback. Examples where this is
            relevant are dropping a PDF or ZIP archive without attachment presentation style explicitly set.
        We first check if we fall into case (1). If so, we can bail early by inserting an attachment; otherwise, we
        proceed normally and see if we can read the contents of the drop as web content. If, at the end of default drop
        handling, we don't still have a way to represent the dropped content, enter case (2).

        file, so we don't end up creating multiple attachment elements for each representation of a single item

        using attachment elements as a fallback representation, if the source writes attributed strings to the
        pasteboard with com.apple.rtfd at a higher fidelity than com.apple.flat-rtfd, we'll end up loading only
        com.apple.rtfd and dropping the text as an attachment element because we cannot convert the dropped content to
        markup. Instead, if flat RTFD is present in the item provider, always prefer that over RTFD so that dropping as

        [Attachment Support] Add plumbing for starting a drag with promised blob data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181201

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Adds logic to allow dragging an attachment element as a file by sending promised blob information to the UI
        process. See comments below for more detail.

        The only change in behavior is that dragging an attachment element will no longer write web content and injected
        bundle data to the pasteboard if the attachment element's file attribute is nonnull. This will cause one
        existing WK1 layout test to fail, but will otherwise not affect any attachment editing clients. On iOS,
        attachment elements in the Mail viewer can be dragged, but each attachment's file is null, so we fall back to
        current behavior; on macOS, Mail currently overrides the drag completely, beginning at -mouseDown:, so this
        doesn't make a difference to macOS Mail either.

        Storage Access API: Refactor XPC for access removal to go straight from the web process to the network process

        No new tests. Existing test re-enabled.

        This change refactors how the web process tells the network process
        to remove storage access. Previously, this was done over the UI process
        just like requests for storage access. But since no further reasoning
        is needed, the message should go straight from the web process to the
        network process for performance reasons and to minimize the risk of a
        race.

        As a consequence, the XPC code for storage access removal in the UI
        process is deleted.

        feLighting is broken with primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181197

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        With <filter primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"> we need to convert the coordinates
        of fePointLights and feSpotLights into user space coordinates. Following
        https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/filters.html#FilterElementPrimitiveUnitsAttribute
        this is done by treating them as fractions of the bounding box on the referencing
        element, with treatment for z following https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#Units_viewport_percentage
        
        To do this, store the bounds of the referencing elemenet on SVGFilterBuilder as
        targetBoundingBox, and store the primitiveUnits type. Then do the conversion of lighting
        coordinates in SVGFESpecularLightingElement::build() and SVGFEDiffuseLightingElement::build().

        Remove SVGFELightElement::findLightSource(), since we need to be able to pass the SVGFilterBuilder
        to the lightSource() function so hoist the code up.

        SVG lighting filter lights are in the wrong coordinate system
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181147

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Point and spot light coordinates weren't being converted into buffer-relative
        coordinates before being fed into the lighting math, resulting in incorrect light
        rendering on Retina devices, and when the filter primitive region was clipped.

        Fix by storing absoluteUnclippedSubregion on FilterEffect, which allows us to map
        lighting points from user space coordinates into the coordinates of the buffer being
        used for rendering. Also scale the light z coordinate by doing a dummy point mapping in x.

        Rename members of PointLightSource and SpotLightSource to make it clear which coordinate
        system they are in.

        [Attachment Support] Introduce data structures and IPC support for writing promised blobs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181189

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Introduces a new header containing structs to be used for writing blob data when dragging. PromisedBlobInfo
        represents information needed to declare data on the pasteboard that will eventually be provided via a Blob.
        This includes the type and filename of the Blob-backed content. PromisedBlobData represents information needed
        to actually deliver the Blob's content to the platform, and is sent some time after its corresponding
        PromisedBlobInfo. The content may either be in the form of a file path (as is the case using the previous
        declareAndWriteAttachment codepath) or a data buffer (which we would use if the Blob is not already backed by a
        file on disk).

        No new tests, since there is no observable change in functionality yet.

        Clients such as Mail would expect pasting or dropping an image with src="https://..." to result in the source
        URL being preserved (i.e. staying as remote images) instead of creating image attachments out of them. This
        patch hooks into the shouldConvertToBlob() check added in r226272 so that it applies to attachment element
        replacement as well.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        No new tests (Behavior change covered by all existing tests).

        This cleans up the abstract MessagePortChannel interface to be in terms of identifiers
        instead of actual MessagePort objects.
        
        The identifiers are compounded with the current ProcessIdentifier meaning they are global
        across all processes for the running UI process, enabling easy cross-process communication.
