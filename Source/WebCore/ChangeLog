        Web Inspector: inspector settings should not be shared between different inspection levels
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151151

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        InspectorController and InspectorFrontendClient should know how to compute their
        inspection levels, so that this level can be exposed to the Inspector frontend for
        preference disambiguation by inspection level.

         - A Page with normal web content has an inspection level of 0.
         - The first Web Inspector has an inspection level of 1.
         - The second Web Inspector that inspects the Inspector has an inspection level of 2.
         - And so forth...

        For local frontend clients (WK1 and the ProtocolTestStub), the inspection level of
        a Page computed as follows:

        - If the page's inspector controller has no frontend client, then the Page
        is normal web content (level 0).
        - If the page's inspector controller has a frontend client, ask for its inspection level.
        A frontend client looks at the inspection level reported by inspected page's inspector
        controller and increments by one to account for the crossed inspection boundary.

        No new tests, this is blocked by test infrastructure fixes (https://webkit.org/b/151573).

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        platformActiveSelectionBackgroundColor(), platformInactiveSelectionBackgroundColor(), etc.
        are const functions intended only to return a color used for painting, but since r174929
        they also change the state of the cached style contexts we use for GTK_TYPE_ENTRY and
        GTK_TYPE_TREE_VIEW. That's wrong; those style contexts should not have any state set. This
        could cause theme colors returned by those GtkStyleContexts to change unexpectedly,
        depending on whether the state is explicitly set before each use, or whether the theme
        actually uses the states.

        This didn't cause any regression only because every place using these style contexts
        explicitly sets the state of the style contexts before use. In fact, the GtkTreeView style
        context is not used anywhere else, and the GtkEntry style context is only used in
        paintTextField, which does set the state before use (and then reverts it using
        save/restore), so this cannot have broken anything in practice. But it's a landmine waiting
        for the next programmer to trip it.

        Fix this with a gtk_style_context_save()/gtk_style_context_restore() pair.
