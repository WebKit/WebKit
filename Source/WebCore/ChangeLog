        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The crash was caused by attributeChanged not destructing the render tree after an assigned element had been
        removed from its slot. Since the style resolver can no longer find this element in the flat tree, we need to
        delete its render object as if the element had been removed from the DOM tree.

        Crash under FormSubmission::create()

        <rdar://problem/30096323>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The issue is that FormSubmission::create() was iterating over
        form.associatedElements() as was calling Element::appendFormData()
        in the loop. HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() was calling
        pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::Load) which causes a synchronous
        layout and can fire events (such as focus event) synchronously.
        Firing those events synchronously allows the JS to modify the
        form.associatedElements() vector we are currently iterating on.

        To avoid this issue, we now call pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::DoNotLoad)
        in HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() as we are not allowed to fire
        synchronous events at this point. I also added a security assertion
        in FormSubmission::create() to catch cases where we fire JS events
        while iterating over the form associated elements to more easily
        notice these things in the future.

        Crash under HTMLFormElement::registerFormElement()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167162

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        didMoveToNewDocument() was re-registering FormAttributeTargetObserver
        even if the element's inDocument was not set yet. As a result, it was
        possible for FormAssociatedElement::resetFormOwner() to be called
        when the element was in the tree but with its inDocument still being
        false (because insertedInto() has not been called yet). This could
        end up calling HTMLFormElement::registerFormElement() even though
        the element is still recognized as detached. This is an issue because
        HTMLFormElement::m_associatedElements's order and its corresponding
        indexes (m_associatedElementsBeforeIndex / m_associatedElementsAfterIndex)
        rely on the position of the element with regards to the form element
        (before / inside / after).

        To address the issue, we now only register the FormAttributeTargetObserver
        in didMoveToNewDocument() if the inDocument flag is set to true. This
        is similar to what is done at other call sites of
        resetFormAttributeTargetObserver(). We also ignore the form content
        attribute in HTMLFormElement::formElementIndex() if the element is
        not connected.

        As per the HTML specification [1], the form content attribute is only
        taken if the element is connected (i.e. inDocument flag is true).

        Note that FormAssociatedElement::findAssociatedForm() was already
        ignoring the form content attribute if the element is disconnected.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Due to a limitation of the pixman backend, which uses 16 bits to hold signed integers, cairo is
        not able to draw anything when using transformation matrices with values bigger than 32768. When
        drawing patterns into large pages, the matrices values can overflow those 16 bits, so cairo doesn't
        draw anything in, which causes the reported transparent backgrounds.

        The patch modifies the transformation matrices both from the current context and the pattern we
        are painting, to avoid them to hold values that cannot stored in 16 bits.

        There's still the possibility that this happens, but it would require using a pattern with a size
        bigger than 32768.

        Adopting a child node of a script element can run script
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167318

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The bug was caused by ScriptElement::childrenChanged indiscriminately running the script.
        Do this only if some node has been inserted as spec'ed:

        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-processing-model
        "The script element is connected and a node or document fragment is inserted into
        the script element, after any script elements inserted at that time."

        Split NonContentsChildChanged into NonContentsChildInserted and NonContentsChildRemoved to disambiguate
        non-contents child such as text and element being removed or inserted. New behavior matches that of
        Gecko and Chrome as well as the latest HTML5 specification.

        Also deploy NoEventDispatchAssertion in more places. Unfortunately, this results in some DOM trees
        internal to WebKit to be mutated while there is NoEventDispatchAssertion in the stack. Added a new RAII
        object "EventAllowedScope" to temporarily disable this assertion within such a tree. CachedSVGFont's
        ensureCustomFontData used to completely disable this assertion but we no longer have to do this either.

        To clarify the new semantics, renamed isEventDispatchForbidden to isEventAllowedInMainThread with
        the negated boolean value, and added a new variant isEventDispatchAllowedInSubtree, which checks
        isEventDispatchForbidden() is true or if the node was one of an internal DOM node or its descendent
        held by EventAllowedScope.

        Document should always have a Settings.
        <https://webkit.org/b/120172>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Since a Document can't move between Frames, and it's either frameless
        or partnered with a Frame provided at construction time, we know that
        it will never need to switch between different Settings objects either.

        Give Document a Ref<Settings> that contains either the Frame's Settings
        or a default-constructed Settings object if frameless.
        Document::settings() is promoted to a reference getter.

        The bulk of this patch is removing now-unnecessary null checks.

        Calling elementAtPoint() on the Document will not return an element in the ShadowRoot,
        we need to call it on the ShadowRoot. So we now iterate over ancestors of the controls

        within the controls bar. We only fade the controls bar out if the tapped element is
        outside of the controls bar hierarchy.

        [Modern Media Controls] Implement reduced and tight padding modes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167933
        <rdar://problem/30396994>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The design specs for modern media controls mandate the following for inline media controls:

            - controls at or below 300pt width use a 12pt left margin for the left buttons container,
            and a 12pt right margin for the right buttons container, and 16pth button margin inside
            both containers ("reduced padding mode").

            - when dropping at or below 120pt width, controls use an 8pt left margin for
            the left buttons container, and an 8pt right margin for the right buttons container, and
            12pt button margin inside both containers and a shorter bar (25pt) ("compact mode").

            - in the case of audio controls, at 400pt or less, controls switch to 12pt margins and
            button margins for both buttons containers ("tight padding mode").

        The "compact" mode was already implemented as a dedicated MacOSInlineMediaControls subclass.
        Since we now have a more generic need to vary the metrics used for inline media controls on
        macOS, we add new features to MacOSInlineMediaControls to support varying metrics based on
        the controls' "layoutTraits" property.

        So MediaController is changed such that it knows to use the new TightPadding and ReducedPadding
        layout traits based on the conditions defined above, and _updateControlsIfNeeded() is changed
        to set the "layoutTraits" property on the controls whenever called, which in our case is most
        relevantly a "resize" event on the shadow root or a TrackEvent on the video tracks (to determine
        when we're possibly changing between a video and audio file).

        As a result, the "layoutTraits" setter is called on MacOSInlineMediaControls, which updates
        the metrics for the various buttons containers, but also notifies the buttons contained
        within that layout traits may have changed, since some buttons support a "compact" appearance
        that is shorter and require a different image file. To that end, IconButton has been updated
        so that it may be notified of a layout traits change through a new layoutTraitsDidChange()
        method, that checks whether the current layout traits differ from those last used when loading
        the icon.

        [EME] Implement MediaKeySession::remove()

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Implement MediaKeySession::remove() as outlined in the specification.

        The CDMInstance::removeSessionData() virtual method is added. CDMInstance
        implementors should remove any session data stored for the session that's
        represented by the passed-in session ID and session type.

        Once the session data is removed, the passed-in callback should be invoked
        by the CDMInstance object so that MediaKeySession can immediately queue a
        task in which it updates key statuses and expiration, reject the promise if
        the data removal failed, or enqueue any license-release message and finally
        successfully resolve the promise.

        MockCDMFactory gains the removeKeysFromSessionWithID() method that purges
        the keys for a given session ID. The method is called from
        MockCDMInstance::removeSessionData() implementation, which passes the
        removed keys to the RemoveSessionDataCallback, along with a license-release
        message that is checked in the tests. The key removal itself isn't tested
        yet because the MediaKeySession's `update key statuses` algorithm isn't
        implemented yet.

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Implement MediaKeySession::close() as outlined in the specification.

        The CDMInstance::closeSession() virtual method, when called, should
        close the session that's represented by the passed-in session ID on
        the CDMInstance implementor object. That's the same session ID that
        the CDMInstance object passes to the MediaKeySession class through
        the callback that's provided to the updateLicense call.

        The CloseSessionCallback, passed to CDMInstance::closeSession(),
        should be invoked by the CDMInstance implementor once the session
        is closed. When that is invoked, another task is queued for the
        MediaKeySession object that runs the `session closed` algorithm
        and resolves the promise.

        MockCDMInstance::closeSession() is defined to remove the session
        from the MockCDMFactory object and invoke the CloseSessionCallback.

        Adopts SPI in WebItemProviderPasteboard for object types that the platform knows how to serialize. Since we use
        -createObjectOfClass: to initialize data when reading off of the pasteboard, we need to match the format that
        objects conforming to UIItemProviderReading will expect. Thus, for all given objects that conform to
        UIItemProviderWriting, we have them register themselves to the item provider.

        We register other UTI types due to the fact that PlatformPasteboardIOS does not care about the specific
        pasteboard used. This should not be necessary, however, since data written to the WebItemProviderPasteboard
        should never need to be read by an actual UIPasteboard. This will be refactored in a future patch to add a
        special type of WebItemProviderPasteboard-aware PlatformPasteboard.

        Also fixes some reference counting issues in WebItemProviderPasteboard by changing the array of _itemProviders

        The jetsams on https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround were caused by WebKit creating the backing store
        for every iframe's layer on the page regardless of whether they're in the viewport or not.

        This was caused by GraphicsLayerCA's setVisibleAndCoverageRects not setting CoverageRectChanged on
        m_uncommittedChanges on the very first call. Fixed the bug by initializing m_uncommittedChanges
        to always have CoverageRectChanged so that the coverage rect would get updated properly.

        Unfortunately, no new tests since somehow the backing store doesn't get created inside the test runner.

        This patch simply moves some functions around to enable the Win, GTK, and EFL ports to compile the
        platform-independent pieces of ComplexTextController. Those parts of ComplexTextController have
        some dependencies which were previously only available on the Cocoa ports; however, those
        dependencies are easily created or moved from elsewhere. The next step is to populate the
        ComplexTextController::collectComplexTextRunsForCharacters() function for DirectWrite and HarfBuzz.
        Once that is done, UniscribeController and HarfBuzzShaper can be deleted.

        We add a new "labelsMayDisplayTimesOverAnHour" to TimeControl so that time labels
        to the left and right of the scrubber may have extra room to display to account for

        such that we don't see layout jumps as the times shown in the labels go around
        the hour mark.

        We also refactor the ElapsedTimeSupport and RemainingTimeSupport in a single
        TimeLabelsSupport class which updates both elapsed and remaining time labels
        and sets the "labelsMayDisplayTimesOverAnHour" on the TimeControl should a

        Web Inspector: allow import() inside the inspector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167457

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        When evaluating `import("...")`, we need the caller's context to resolve
        the module specifier correctly. For example, if `import("./cocoa.js")` is
        evaluated in the script "drinks/hot.js", this module name is resolved to
        "drinks/cocoa.js". If the same import operator is evaluated in the script
        "menu/all.js", the module specifier becomes "menu/cocoa.js".

        Previously we reject the import operator if the caller does not have such
        a context. These context is SourceOrigin and its ScriptFetcher. While they
        are offered in the script tag and other code evaluations, the inspector
        console does not offer that. These class are offered in the WebCore side
        and we should not touch these classes in the JSC's inspector code.

        Now we relax the above restriction. If the above caller information is not
        offered, we fallback to the default one. In the web page, we use the page's
        URL as the caller's source origin. This allows us to evaluate the import
        operator in the inspector console.

        And as of r167698, the console recognizes `await import("...")` form. We use
        this to test this `import()` in the console functionality.

        Overlay scrolling with iframe-s broken
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165056

        Reviewed by Antonio Gomes.

        Mouse press events for overlay scrollbars are ignored if there's a subframe under the scrollbar. This doesn't
        happen with normal scrollbars, because the subframe is not really under the scrollbar, so events are always
        correctly passed to the scrollbar. With overlay scrollbars, the hit test detects the scrollbar, but events are
        always passed first to the subframe. Scrollbars are correctly updated on hover though, because
        handleMouseMoveEvent checks the presence of scrollbars before checking for subframes and move events are
        actually passed to both, the scrollbar and the subframe. Overlay scrollbars should always take precedence over
        subframes to handle mouse press events, so we should check first if mouse is over a scrollbar and never pass the
        event to a subframe in that case. Another problem is that the cursor is not updated either when the overlay
        scrollbar is hovered and there's a subframe. This is because in handleMouseMoveEvent we pass the event to both
        the scrollbar and subframe but we never update the cursor when a suframe was found. So, here again we need to make
        an exception for scrollbars and upate the cursor when mouse is over the scrollbar even if a subframe was found.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The system timer fires little bit slower than 60fps. This might cause the
        frame to be missed and hence it can lower the frame rate significantly. The
        rAF timer was set to 15ms for the same reason. So set the repeated CSS
        animation timer also to 15ms.

        Optimize searching through SampleMap by presentationTime.

        Many of the methods exposed by PresentationOrderSampleMap used the bare  std::equal_range,
        lower_bound, or upper_bound methods. Unlike those methods exposed on std::map, the bare
        search methods perform a linear O(n) search, rather than a the binary O(log(n)) search used
        by std::map. Rewrite those methods using the bare methods in terms of the std::map search
        methods.

        Drive-by fix: rename findSampleOnOrAfterPresentationTime to

        <rdar://problem/30348790>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We were only listening to the "loadedmetadata", "error", "webkitpresentationmodechanged"
        and "webkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged" events to invalidate the enabled state
        for the PiP button. We also need to check availability of video tracks, which we already
        did for fullscreen, which is quite similar.
        
        So we now listen to "addtrack", "removetrack" and "change" events on the media.videoTracks
        property, which correctly invalidates the PiP button when the first video track becomes
        available or the last video track is removed.

        Since a couple of other MediaControllerSupport subclasses (FullscreenSupport and TracksSupport)
        would also listen to those events on various track types, we add a new "tracksToMonitor"
        property on MediaControllerSupport which subclasses can override to provide a list of tracks
        that should listen to those events. This removes the need for dedicated construction and
        destruction time in MediaControllerSupport subclasses that need to listen to events on
        tracks rather than the media itself.

        Clean up how GraphicsLayer's "inWindow" state is set, and fix some issues with Page Overlays
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167850

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.
        
        RenderLayerCompositor::setIsInWindowForLayerIncludingDescendants() walked the RenderLayer
        tree to set the GraphicsLayer's "inWindow" state. This had the problem of skipping non-primary
        GraphicsLayers. We also never did this work for page overlay layers.

        Fix by giving GraphicsLayers a recursive function that sets the inWindow state, and call that
        from RenderLayerCompositor::setIsInWindow() and PageOverlayController.

        PageOverlayController also needs to implement tiledBackingUsageChanged so that tiled backings
        created dynamically get the correct in-window state.

        Page overlays also had some serious issues in MiniBrowser, in that they disappeared on reload,
        and on hide/show web view. This was because the overlay root layers were re-parented, but
        addChild() for each overlay's layer wasn't called. Clean up by replacing willAttachRootLayer() followed
        by viewOverlayRootLayer()/documentOverlayRootLayer() with single calls that set up the layers,
        update the inWindow state, and return the layer.

        Make it possible to dump tile caches in page overlay tests.

        Make showGraphicsLayers() always dump page overlay layers (source of much confusion).

        Apparently RenderText::canUseSimpleFontCodePath() only checks if the string is qualified for
        the simple font code path. However certain css properties could still force us to use the complex
        path.
        In most cases, we still do only one string traversal thanks to TextRun::setCharacterScanForCodePath().

        Move TextureMapper-specific logic out of GraphicsContext3DPrivate
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167096

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Move the TextureMapper-specific functionality in GraphicsContext3DPrivate into a
        separate class. The new TextureMapperGC3DPlatformLayer class inherits from the
        class that's aliased to the PlatformLayer type, like GraphicsContext3DPrivate did
        before.

        In GraphicsContext3D, the new m_texmapLayer member variable of the
        std::unique_ptr<TextureMapperGC3DPlatformLayer> type is used for configurations
        that enable TextureMapper, largely the same way the GraphicsContext3DPrivate
        object was used before. The remaining code in GraphicsContext3DPrivate is left
        unchanged to keep it working for other ports.

        No new tests -- no change in behavior.

        Correctly set the "inWindow" flag for TileControllers that aren't the page tiles, and clarify "usingTiledBacking" logic
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167774

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        RenderLayerBacking had some very confusing "usingTiledCacheLayer" uses.

        Its member variable, m_usingTiledCacheLayer, really meant "m_isMainFrameLayerWithTiledBacking" so make it so.
        It had a usingTiledBacking(), which returned the same thing, which this patch replaces with isMainFrameLayerWithTiledBacking().

        The fact that usingTiledBacking() was only true for the page tiled layer tripped up
        RenderLayerCompositor::setIsInWindowForLayerIncludingDescendants(), which would only ever call setIsInWindow()
        on the page tiled layer. These changes fix that.

        Also make a way for tests to unparent the web view via UIScriptController, and dump out the "in window"
        status of TileBackings when dumping tile caches.

        This patch fixes that by marking link preload resources as such, so that they can be handled separately inside clearPreloads().
        As this fix also exposed an issue with load cancelation with invalid hrefs (which tests were passing before due to the preloads
        being cleared), said issue is also fixed by clearing previousely preloaded resources if an invalid link preload is later detected.

        While this assertion is true in theory and as per the specification, it does
        not hold in WebKit when parsing a DocumentFragment. This is because WebKit
        has an optimization causing us to have a DocumentFragment as root element
        when parsing a fragment. See the following constructor:
        "HTMLTreeBuilder(HTMLDocumentParser&, DocumentFragment&, Element&, ParserContentPolicy, const HTMLParserOptions&)"

        // https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#parsing-html-fragments

        m_tree.openElements().pushRootNode(HTMLStackItem::create(fragment));

        Files cached on disk by MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer are deleted only when the player is closed. If the

        of those temporary files to a proper temporary directory (/var/tmp, as those files aren't actually
        reusable, so they don't belong to a cache directory, and /tmp is a bad place because it's RAM-based on
        some distros), unlinks (deletes) them right after creation and also deletes any other stalled temporary
        file on the old legacy cache directory.

        There's no API in GstPlaybin to control the temporary file location, so we do it manually by locating
        the GstDownloadBuffer element in the pipeline as soon as it's created, reconfiguring it with the right

        <rdar://problem/30116072>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Add a new timer-based memory pressure monitor that checks the process memory
        footprint every 30 seconds and reacts to changes by setting a MemoryUsagePolicy.

        There are four MemoryUsagePolicy values:

            - Unrestricted (below 1GB)
            - Conservative (above 1GB)
            - Strict (above 2GB)
            - Panic (above 4GB, or 3GB if 32-bit)

        For Strict and above, the old-style "isUnderMemoryPressure()" API will return true.

        Transitioning to a higher policy will cause memory pressure handlers to run:

        At Strict, we run the "non-critical" memory pressure handler, then carry on.

        At Panic, we run the "critical" memory pressure handler. If that fails to recover
        enough memory to bring us back below 4GB, we may kill the process:

        A process is eligible to get killed for using too much memory if:

            - It's not visible on screen (i.e it's a background tab.)
            - It's not playing audio.
            - It has not performed a main frame navigation in the last hour.

        Before killing the process, an exit-time callback will run. This patch installs such
        a callback that prints out some time-of-death statistics about C++ and JavaScript memory
        usage to hopefully help understand what was soaking up all the memory.

        If an invalid IPv4 address contains the first syntaxViolation (difference between input and canonicalized URL),
        an iterator is used to calculate how far we have parsed in the input string to copy all the syntax-violation-free
        characters into a Vector. If a URL contains only ASCII that doesn't contain anything percent-encoded in the host,
        there is a fast path to parse ASCII hosts.  All my existing invalid IPv4 tests followed this path.
        If there is a non-ASCII character, we need to use an iterator to the original string instead of an iterator
        to the string after converting the input string's host to ASCII.

        [Modern Media Controls] Provide a compact mode for when the controls are small
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167746
        <rdar://problem/29565842>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When the macOS inline media controls become too narrow to display both the volume and fullscreen
        buttons in their right container (width < 242), we switch to a compact mode where the controls bar
        is shorter and the buttons smaller.

        To facilitate this, we provide a new subclass of MacOSInlineMediaControls called MacOSCompactInlineMediaControls
        which changes some of the layout properties of the buttons to have shorter margins around buttons.

        We also added a new "Compact" LayoutTrait and improved IconService to provide specific icons
        for this mode for the buttons that can exist in compact mode. 

        To correctly implement the design, we needed to add a way to provide different margins around the
        left and right edges of the container, so the "padding" property is now split between "leftMargin"
        and "rightMargin", and to make property naming cleaner, the "margin" property which specifies the
        space between each button in a container is now called "buttonMargin". We also set the default
        values for those properties to be 24 (instead of 0) which are the most widely used values, requiring
        less customization.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Add a new timer-based memory pressure monitor that checks the process memory
        footprint every 30 seconds and reacts to changes by setting a MemoryUsagePolicy.

        There are four MemoryUsagePolicy values:

            - Unrestricted (below 1GB)
            - Conservative (above 1GB)
            - Strict (above 2GB)
            - Panic (above 4GB, or 3GB if 32-bit)

        For Strict and above, the old-style "isUnderMemoryPressure()" API will return true.

        Transitioning to a higher policy will cause memory pressure handlers to run:

        At Strict, we run the "non-critical" memory pressure handler, then carry on.

        At Panic, we run the "critical" memory pressure handler. If that fails to recover
        enough memory to bring us back below 4GB, we may kill the process:

        A process is eligible to get killed for using too much memory if:

            - It's not visible on screen (i.e it's a background tab.)
            - It's not playing audio.
            - It has not performed a main frame navigation in the last hour.

        Before killing the process, an exit-time callback will run. This patch installs such
        a callback that prints out some time-of-death statistics about C++ and JavaScript memory
        usage to hopefully help understand what was soaking up all the memory.

        Upon destruction of a Page, we destroy the BackForwardClient, which is supposed
        to keep track of HistoryItems associated to this particular page and remove them
        from the PageCache. Given the crash trace, the issue seems to be that some
        HistoryItems associated with the Page sometimes linger in the PageCache *after*
        the Page has been destroyed, which leads to crashes later on when pruning the
        PageCache.

        In order to make the process more robust, this patch refactors the code so that
        the Page is now in charge of removing all its associated HistoryItems from the
        PageCache instead of relying on the BackForwardClient. Also, instead of having
        the Page keep track of which HistoryItems are associated with it (which is
        error prone), we now scan all PageCache entries instead to find which ones are
        associated with the Page. While this is in theory slower, this is much safer
        and in practice not an issue because the PageCache usually has 3-5 entries.

        No new tests, could not reproduce.

        [EME][GStreamer] Fixed decryptor selection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167588

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        GStreamer selected a decryptor automatically but we need to be
        able to tell it which decryptor we want because one file can be
        encrypted with more than one system and the one we want to use can
        depend on what the user tells us.

        Now when the demuxer is about to select the demuxer, it runs a
        GstContext query with the events, which are forwarded through the
        EME api to the application, which will answer the the
        generateKeyRequest and then we can instruct the demuxer to select
        the one we tell it, not the one that is selected automatically. If
        the demuxer has already a preferred decryptor, the codepath will
        be similar to the older one.

        Something that is also fixed is the report of the keyneeded event,
        which will contain all pssh boxes as requested by the spec.

        Move WebSQLiteDatabaseTrackerClient from WebKitLegacy to WebCore so that it can be accessible from
        WebKit1 and WebKit2. Previously, to avoid dependencies on UIKit, WebKitLegacy introduced several
        global methods for UIKit to setup the start/end background task blocks on runtime (WebKitSetStartBackgroundTaskBlock,
        WebKitSetInvalidWebBackgroundTaskIdentifier and WebKitSetEndBackgroundTaskBlock). Since we have to
        move the background task handling to WebCore, to avoid adding WebCore dependencies on UIKit, this
        patch introdues a new WebCore class WebBackgroundTaskController which holds the start/end background
        task blocks. The existing WebKitSetStartBackgroundTaskBlock and WebKitSetEndBackgroundTaskBlock methods
        in WebKit1 will use WebBackgroundTaskController to store the blocks set by UIKit.

        [EME] Implement MediaKeySession::update()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167636

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Implement the MediaKeySession::update() method by following the steps as
        they are described in the specification.

        In order to sanitize the passed-in response data, CDM::sanitizeResponse()
        is added. It passes the SharedBuffer object by reference to the CDMPrivate
        interface implementor, which returns a SharedBuffer object containing
        sanitized response data.

        CDMInstance::updateLicense() virtual method is added to perform the license
        update for some specific CDMInstance object. After the update the CDMInstance
        invokes the callback that's passed to updateLicense(), providing information
        about session being closed, changed keys or expiration value, any message
        that has to be enqueued, and whether the update was successful.

        After that callback is invoked, MediaKeySession::update() goes on to handle
        all the provided information in a future task, finally resolving the promise
        (or rejecting it beforehand in case of any failure during response handling
        or license update).

        Three algorithms that can be invoked from MediaKeySession::update() (key
        status update, expiration update and session closure) will be implemented
        separately. Placeholder methods are provided until then.

        MockCDM::sanitizeResponse() and MockCDMInstance::updateLicense() are
        implemented for testing purposes. For now only the response sanitization
        and sanitized response format are checked there. Key status update,
        expiration update and session closure should be tested once the
        implementations for those algorithms are added.

        Running media/controls/track-menu.html before media/modern-media-controls/tracks-support/tracks-
        support-click-track-in-panel.html makes that test time out in all test runs. The root of the issue
        is that animations are suspended by media/controls/track-menu.html with a call to
        internals.suspendAnimations(), and that state isn't reset with a call to internals.resumeAnimations().
        Then, media/modern-media-controls/tracks-support/tracks-support-click-track-in-panel.html fails because
        the selection animation for the tracks panel menu item that is clicked never completes and the delegate
        to notify that an item in the tracks panel was selected is never fired, which leads to the test failure.

        We change Internals::suspendAnimations() and Internals::resumeAnimations() to only affect the current
        document, rather than calling into AnimationController::suspendAnimations() which would do just that,
        but also set a Frame-wide flag that would prevent further animations from running, even in a subsequent

        NULL-deref crash in TextTrack::removeCue()

        Test: http/tests/media/track-in-band-hls-metadata-crash.html

        Follow-up to r211401. When passing around a reference to an object, the assumption is that
        the caller is retaining the underlying object. This breaks down for
        InbandDataTextTrack::removeDataCue(), which releases its own ownership of the cue object,
        then passes the reference to that object to its superclass to do further remove steps. The
        retain count of the cue can thus drop to zero within the scope of
        InbandTextTrack::removeCue(). Use "take" semantics to remove the cue from the
        m_incompleteCueMap without releasing ownership, and pass a reference to that retained object
        on to removeCue(), guaranteeing that the cue will not be destroyed until after the
        romeveDataCue() method returns.

        Propagate networking errors correctly for import() operator
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167501

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        We use the promise chain inside the module loader pipeline.
        The problem is that,

        1. The errors of loading module scripts are propagated through the promise's rejection.
        2. Some module related errors like syntax error (when scanning module dependencies) are
           reported at loading time (evaluating time). These errors are propagated through the
           promise rejections and dumped to the console. LoadableModuleScript set catch handler
           for that and print these errors to the console for ScriptElement.
        3. Some of errors are already reported to the console. For example, networking errors
           are reported by the CachedModuleLoader.
        4. But there is no way to distinguish between (2) and (3) at the catch handler.

        Previously, we propagate the special symbol for the already reported errors to distinguish
        that. This was OK because these errors cannot be catched by the user code. However,
        recent `import()` call needs to expose these errors to the user code. So now, accidentally,
        the special purpose symbol is exposed.

        Instead of propagating the special symbol, this patch just propagates the errors. But these
        error objects are annotated with the private symbol. So these errors can be distinguished
        from the other ones.

        Currently, we do not have the way to expose the error details to the client of the
        CachedScript. So we just report the error with the failed / canceled. This should be
        more descriptive error messages in the separate patch[1].

        Reverts an unintended change made while refactoring code for input events that caused input events to be
        dispatched immediately rather than on the scoped queue. Normally, input events are dispatched in
        CompositeEditCommand::apply after the end of the scope, but TypingCommands may fire input events *from within*
        the scope by calling typingAddedToOpenCommand.

        Instead, TypingCommands should always dispatch events
        synchronously after the end of the scoped queue in CompositeEditCommand::apply, but this is a riskier change
        than we should currently allow, so we should revert to our old behavior for the time being.

        <rdar://problem/30241193>

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        When destroying a PageCache entry, we would call Document::prepareFromDestruction()
        which would destroy the render tree and then call FrameView::didDestroyRenderTree().
        We would sometimes hit the ASSERT(m_widgetsInRenderTree.isEmpty()) assertion in
        didDestroyRenderTree(). This indicates that there are still RenderWidgets associated
        with the FrameView even though we claim we already destroyed the render tree.

        The reason for this is that, in the PageCache context, the top document's frame is
        reused on navigation and may not be associated with a new document that is currently
        displayed, has a render tree (and possible RenderWidgets). The solution proposed is
        to stop calling FrameView::didDestroyRenderTree() in Document::prepareFromDestruction()
        if the frame's document is not |this|. This happens when the document is destroyed
        while in PageCache. We do not want to mess with the frame / frameview in this case
        since they are no longer associated to the present document anymore.

        No new tests, already covered by existing tests which currently crash flakily.

        [QuickLook] FrameLoaderClient should return the new QuickLookHandleClient it creates
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167625

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        QuickLookHandleClients were being created by QuickLookHandle calling
        FrameLoaderClient::didCreateQuickLookHandle() then having the FrameLoaderClient create a new
        QuickLookHandleClient and set it using QuickLookHandle::setClient().

        Since all FrameLoaderClient::didCreateQuickLookHandle() does is create a new
        QuickLookHandleClient, this patch changes the FrameLoaderClient function to return the new
        QuickLookHandleClient directly and removes the API from QuickLookHandle to set a client.
        This also removes previewFileName() and previewUTI() from QuickLookHandle and instead passes
        these as arguments to the FrameLoaderClient.

        It's possible for a track to be removed which was never actually added to the cue list.
        Specifically, if an in-band track with a negative start or end time was parsed, it would
        have been rejected by TextTrack::addCue(). When it comes time to flush those in-band cues,

        [QuickLook] QLPreviewConverter and QuickLookHandle have different lifetime requirements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167609

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        Currently, QuickLookHandles are owned by DocumentLoader so that the underlying
        QLPreviewConverter stays alive to service subresource requests. However, the QuickLookHandle
        itself only needs to live long enough to handle the main resource load. And in a follow-on
        patch we will need to create QLPreviewConverters independent of QuickLookHandle.

        This patch moves ownership of QuickLookHandle from DocumentLoader to ResourceLoader. It also
        creates a C++ wrapper around QLPreviewConverter and teaches QuickLookHandle to transfer
        ownership of the wrapper to DocumentLoader once the main resource conversion is complete.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch brings the implementation of ComplexTextController in-line with the
        design at https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/ComplexTextController. Previously,
        ComplexTextController had a few problems:
        - The total width computed by ComplexTextController didn't match the width if
        you iterated over the entire string and added up the advances
        - FontCascade::getGlyphsAndAdvancesForComplexText() tried to compensate for
        the above by construing the concepts of paint advances as distinct from layout
        advances
        - Initial advances were considered part of layout sometimes and part of painting
        other times, depending on which function reports the information
        - For RTL runs, the wrong origin was added to the initial advance, and the origin
        should have been subtracted instead of added

        This patch exhaustively updates every function in ComplexTextController to be
        consistent with the design linked to above. This design solves all of these
        problems.

        (WebCore::ComplexTextController::advance): This function had completely busted
        logic about the relationship between initial advances and the first origin in

        in m_adjustedBaseAdvances, this entire block can be removed and the raw paint
        initial advance can be reported to the GlyphBuffer. Later in the function, we
        have to update the logic about how to compute a paint advance given a layout
        advance and some origins. In particular, there are two tricky pieces here: 1.
        The layout advance for the first glyph is equal to (initial advance - first
        origin + first Core Text advance, so computing the paint offset must cancel out
        the initial layout offset, and 2. the last paint advance in a run must actually
        end up at the position of the first glyph in the next run, so the next run's
        initial advance must be queried.
        (WebCore::ComplexTextController::adjustGlyphsAndAdvances): Previously, we
        represented an initial advance of a successive run by just adding it to the
        previous run's last advance. However, this is incompatible with the new model
        presented in the link above, so we remove this section. We also have to add in
        the logic that the layout advance for the first glyph is equal to the formula
        presented above.

        Fixed elements should not rubber-band in WK2, nor remain at negative offsets

        rdar://problem/29453068

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        There were various problems with the layout rect computation:
        1. It ignored the scrollBehaviorForFixedElements() which we use to avoid rubber-banding fixed
           elements in WK2, but allow in WK1, so make use of that.
        2. Sometimes layouts/paints of fixed elements would be triggered when coalesced calls to
           AsyncScrollingCoordinator::scheduleUpdateScrollPositionAfterAsyncScroll() failed to
           copy the layoutViewportOrigin to the scheduled update.
        3. The layout viewport could be left with a negative top/left after rubber-banding.
        
        Also add a way to do unconstrained scrollTo(), so that a test can call window.scrollTo(-10, -10) to
        simulate rubberbanding.

        When we would identify that we need to prolong an existing auto-hide timer, when the previous
        auto-hide timer was marked as non-cancelable, calling _cancelAutoHideTimer() would not actually
        cancel the previous timer, which would let it fire and hide the controls bar. We now have two
        methods, _cancelAutoHideTimer() which always cancels the current auto-hide timer, and
        _cancelNonEnforcedAutoHideTimer() which is used from all other existing call sites, which only
        cancels the current auto-hide timer if it was marked as cancelable. This, and revised timing in
        the test itself, make media/modern-media-controls/media-controller/media-controller-auto-hide-
        mouse-leave-after-play.html a lot more reliable.

        We also make a small drive-by fix where we ensure the "autoHideDelay" property is set first so
        that setting other members which may set a timer do not used an undefined value for the auto-hide
        timer delay.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        ComplexTextController has three phases:
        1. Interrogate Core Text about some text
        2. Compute layout advances and paint advances from the information retrieved from
        Core Text
        3. Iterate through the layout advances or paint advances.

        This patch tests phases 2 and 3 by chopping ComplexTextController between
        phases 1 and 2, and injecting foreign metrics from a unit test. These metrics
        have been gathered from real-world uses; however, a layout test is not appropriate
        because the fonts which produced these metrics are not licensed appropriately.
        The tests can enforce the correct behavior by using ComplexTextController's
        public API.

        This is in preparation for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166013.
        However, the fix for that bug is quite large, so I've split out this smaller piece
        to ease the reviewing burden. The tests I've added are disabled for now (because
        they fail), but will be enabled by the fix to that bug.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Cache-control value 'immutable' indicates that a subresource does not change and so does not need to be
        revalidated on a normal reload. This can significantly speed up reloads and reduce network traffic.

        It is has been implemented in Firefox and is already used by Facebook.

        https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mcmanus-immutable-00
        https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/

        This patch implements Cache-control: immutable for memory cache only. A disk cache implementation
        doesn't seem necessary as the resource is basically always expected to be in memory cache on reload.

        Implement dynamic-import for WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166926

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This patch introduces browser side dynamic-import implementation.
        The dynamic-import is new ES feature which is now stage 3.
        The JSC shell already implements it.

        The dynamic-import allows us to kick module loading in a dynamic manner.
        For example, you can write,

            await module = import(`${HOST}/hello.js`);

        The dynamic `import` operator (this is not a function) returns a promise with
        module namespace object if the module loading succeeds. Otherwise, it returns
        a rejected promise.

        And importantly, this feature allows us to kick module loading from classic script.
        Previously, module loading can be only used from <script type="module"> tag. And
        all the module loading is done statically.

        (WebCore::rejectPromise):
        (WebCore::ScriptModuleLoader::importModule):
        New hook moduleLoaderImportModule is implemented. This hook is called when
        `import` operator is used. This hook is responsible to
            1. resolve the module name to obtain module specifier. (like, resolve the
                relative URL to get absolute URL.)
            2. kick module loading with the resolved specifier.
        When resolving the module name, the referrer information is needed.
        For example, "./script.js" will be resolved to "http://example.com/script.js" if
        the referrer module specifier is "http://example.com/".
        If `import("./script.js")` is executed in the classic script
        src="http://example.com/test.js", it starts loading "http://example.com/script.js".
        So the information of the caller of `import` operator is necessary here.
        This appropriate referrer is propagated by SourceOrigin.

        Crash when navigating back to a page in PacheCache when one of its frames has been removed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167421
        <rdar://problem/30188490>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Disallow page caching of a page if:
        1. The main window has an opener (i.e. it was opened via window.open)
        2. It has ever used window.open()

        This is because allowing page caching in this case would allow such
        windows to script each other even after one of them entered Page
        Cache. Allowing this is dangerous and easily causes crashes.

        This is a short term workaround until we find a better solution to
        the problem. One issue is this workaround is that navigating back
        to a page that has an opener or used window.open() will not longer
        get the page from PageCache. As a result, state may be lost upon
        navigating back. However, we never guarantee that pages get page
        cached, and Chrome does not have a PageCache.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167453

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Requests to x-apple-ql-id: URLs should be filtered by
        -[QLPreviewConverter safeRequestForRequest:]. This method checks that the URL is one of the
        ones generated for the current preview, and changes it to "about:" if it isn't.

        WebCore::safeQLURLForDocumentURLAndResourceURL() was responsible for finding the
        QLPreviewConverter instance to use by looking it up in an NSMutableDictionary using the
        document URL as a key. In WebKit1, this dictionary was populated by the
        QuickLookHandleClient when new QuickLookHandles were created, but the WebKit2
        QuickLookHandleClient never did this. As a result, requests to invalid URLs were not being
        rewritten.

        An easy way to load a QuickLook document with invalid URLs is to create an HTML file with a
        Microsoft Office extension (e.g. .xls); QuickLook, iWork, and Office support opening HTML
        files with Office document extensions. In r207155 we applied a Content Security Policy to
        QuickLook documents that only allows x-apple-ql-id: resources to load. This blocked
        cross-origin requests from loading, but same-origin requests to URLs that weren't generated
        by QLPreviewConverter were still allowed to load.

        This change blocks these URLs by calling -[QLPreviewConverter safeRequestForRequest:] in a
        way that works for both WebKit1 and WebKit2.

        After implementing QuickLook for WebKit2, we found a bug when loading HTML-as-Office
        documents (webkit.org/b/135651) that presented as a nil MIME type in the preview
        NSURLResponse returned by QLPreviewConverter. Unfortunately r172159 papered over the actual
        bug by failing to load previews with nil MIME types.

        The real issue was that we were asking for the preview response before QuickLook had
        received enough data to determine a MIME type, so this change also removes the bad fix from
        r172159 and instead waits until QuickLook has converted the document to ask for its preview
        response. This restores the ability to load HTML files with Office document extensions.
        These two fixes are combined in a single patch because I don't know how to create an invalid
        QuickLook URL for testing without loading an HTML-as-Office document.

        Test: quicklook/invalid-ql-id-url.html

        * loader/ResourceLoader.cpp:
        (WebCore::ResourceLoader::willSendRequestInternal): Called
        QuickLookHandle::willSendRequest() if m_documentLoader has a QuickLookHandle.
        * loader/cache/CachedResource.cpp:
        (WebCore::CachedResource::load): Removed the call to
        WebCore::safeQLURLForDocumentURLAndResourceURL().
        * loader/ios/QuickLook.h: Removed safeQLURLForDocumentURLAndResourceURL() and declared
        QuickLookHandle::willSendRequest().
        * loader/ios/QuickLook.mm: Removed _previewResponse and _hasFailed ivars from
        WebPreviewConverter.
        (-[WebPreviewConverter initWithResourceLoader:resourceResponse:quickLookHandle:]): Stopped
        setting _previewResponse.
        (-[WebPreviewConverter _sendDidReceiveResponseIfNecessary]): Only emptied _bufferedDataArray
        if we haven't already called -_sendDidReceiveResponseIfNecessary; removed the check for a
        nil _previewResponse MIME type; accessed -[QLPreviewConverter previewResponse] now that the
        document has been converted and asserted its MIME type is non-nil.
        (-[WebPreviewConverter connection:didReceiveData:lengthReceived:]): Removed _hasFailed check.
        (-[WebPreviewConverter connectionDidFinishLoading:]): Ditto.
        (isQuickLookPasswordError): Moved the check for password failure errors to here from
        -connection:didFailWithError: for better readability.
        (-[WebPreviewConverter connection:didFailWithError:]): Removed _hasFailed check and used
        more early returns.
        (WebCore::QuickLookHandle::willSendRequest): Filtered the request through
        -[QLPreviewConverter safeRequestWithRequest:] if the request URL's scheme is x-apple-ql-id:.
        (WebCore::safeQLURLForDocumentURLAndResourceURL): Deleted.

        classInfo should take a VM so it is not materialized from the object on each call
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167424

        Rubber Stamped by Michael Saboff.

        Previously, classInfo() would get the VM from the target's
        MarkedBlock.  Most callers already have a VM on hand, so it is
        wasteful to compute the VM from the marked block every time. This
        patch refactors some of the most common callers of classInfo(),
        jsDynamicCast and inherits to take a VM as well.

        WebGL content in Safari sticks to GPU that it was started on, sometimes causing extra battery drain and difficulty interacting with UI
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167477
        <rdar://problem/29956321>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        We were not implementing the recommended approach to properly handle
        GPU switching, causing some contexts to remain on a GPU and slow
        down the machine's UI. It also could stop the discrete GPU from
        turning off.

        Register for CGL's display reconfiguration notification, so that we
        can alert any active CGLContexts and cause them to update.

        The code change here doesn't lend itself to automated testing because
        it is specific to hardware with multiple GPUs, relies on some separate
        tools to detect which GPU is active, and an external method of triggering
        a GPU switch. It's best tested by the manual workflow in Radar.

        Autoplay muted videos stop playback of any streaming app in the background
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163993
        <rdar://problem/29020431>

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Added test in TestWebKitAPI, WebKit1.AudioSessionCategoryIOS.

        Previously, we would set the audio session category to "playback" if there was a media-
        element-type media session, and if there was a session capable of playing audio. But because
        this was an "or" operation, we would incorrectly set the category to "playback" if there was
        a video element incapable of rendering audio (due to being muted, without an audio track,
        etc.), and also a session capable of producing audio, such as WebAudio.

        With this change, this turns into an "and" operation; there must be a media element capable
        of rendering audio in order to switch the audio session category to "playback".

        Additionally, we no longer cache the value of "canProduceAudio()"; it's queried directly
        whenever updateSessionState() is called.

        EventTarget should visit the JSEventListeners using visitAdditionalChildren
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167462

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        No new tests because this is already caught by existing testing. This would show up as ASSERTs
        in debug, and we suspect it might be at fault for null deref crashes.
        
        Previously, EventTarget would have its event listeners visited by its subclasses' visitChildren
        methods. Every subclass of EventTarget would call EventTarget's visitJSEventListeners. For
        example, this means that if JSFoo has seven classes between it and JSEventTarget in the JSCell
        class hierarchy, then JSFoo::visitChildren would end up calling visitJSEventListeners seven extra
        times.
        
        Also, the weird way that visitJSEventListeners was called meant that it was not part of the GC's
        output constraint processing. This meant that it would not be called when the GC tried to
        terminate. So, if something about the event listener changes during a GC cycle, the GC would
        potentially fail to mark one of the references.
        
        Both problems can be solved by simply moving the call to visitJSEventListeners into
        visitAdditionalChildren.

        ImageBufferCairo: cairo_image_surface should use bmalloc-allocated memory
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165751

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Allocate the underlying memory for cairo_image_surface objects through FastMalloc.
        This way we can steer such large allocations away from the default libc allocator.

        Objects of this class can create Cairo surfaces that need as much as 4MB of memory
        for the underlying pixel buffer. Allocating such objects through the default
        libc allocator can lead to increased memory usage because of non-optimal allocation
        strategy in libc. In contrast, bmalloc performs large allocations by directly using
        mmap() to reserve the necessary memory.

        The improvements can be significant. On nytimes.com, with the threaded version of
        the CoordinatedGraphics system, the memory consumption can drop by roughly 20%.

        Crash under DOMSelection::deleteFromDocument()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167232

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The crash was caused by DOMSelection's deleteFromDocument() mutating contents inside the user-agent
        shadow tree of an input element when the text field is readonly. Fixed the bug by exiting early
        whenever the selection is inside a shadow tree since getSelection().getRangeAt(0) always returns
        a range outside the input element or any shadow tree for that matter.

        New behavior matches that of Gecko. The working draft spec of which I'm the editor states that
        deleteFromDocument() must invoke Range's deleteContents() on the associated range, which is
        the collapsed range returned by getSelection().getRangeAt(0) in the spec:
        https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-selection-api-20160921/#widl-Selection-deleteFromDocument-void
        And Range's deleteContents() immediately terminates in step 1 when start and end are identical:
        https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/6b7621282c2e3b222ac585650e484abf4c0a416b/

        Note that Range's DOM mutating methods are not available inside an user-agent shadow tree because
        WebKit never returns a Range whose end boundary points are inside the tree to author scripts.
        Editing commands (ones executable from document.execCommand) that mutate DOM like this check whether
        the content is editable or not. Since VisibleSelection's validate() function makes sure the selection
        is either entirely within or outside of an root editable element (editing host in the W3C spec lingo),
        editing commands should never mutate a random node inside an user-agent shadow tree.

        Revert r210882, removing support for background-repeat-x/y

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        CSSPropertyBackgroundRepeatX and CSSPropertyBackgroundRepeatY only exist to make it easier
        to parse CSSPropertyBackgroundRepeat as if it were a shorthand; they were never intended to
        be web-exposed. r210882 mistakenly expose them to the web, so undo that patch, and annotate
        the properties in CSSProperties.json with a flag which indicates their special status.

        In addition, remove background-repeat-x/y from the list of properties allowed in video cues,
        since these are not valid properties.

        Add the support for nomodule attribute on script element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166987

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        As discussed on https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/2261, we should have
        the way to suppress classic script execution when our user agent have
        modules support. With such a feature, developers can write the code like,

            <script type="module" src="./app.js"></script>
            <script nomodule src="./bundled-app.js"></script>

        In the above code, if the user agent does not support modules, the bundled-app.js
        will be executed. On the other hand, if the user agent supports modules, we should
        ignore the script tag which has the `nomodule` attribute.
        This way allows us to support the legacy browsers while using modules.

        In WebKit, we already support modules. Thus, we should ignore the classic script
        attributed `nomodule`.

        We also rename asyncAttributeValue and deferAttributeValue to hasAsyncAttribute and
        hasDeferAttribute.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When DatabaseTracker::deleteDatabasesModifiedSince() is called with a min time, all databases for every origin
        are deleted. For each origin if all databases are removed DatabaseTracker::deleteOrigin() is called to remove
        also the origin database file. However, DatabaseTracker::deleteOrigin() returns early if the origin doesn't have
        databases and in this particular case it never has databases, because we have just removed them.

        This will be covered by GTK+ unit tests.

        [Cocoa] Unify FontPlatformData's hashing and equality operators
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167061

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        On iOS, we were using CFEqual() and CFHash(), while on macOS
        we were using pointer hashing and pointer equality. Instead,
        we should be consistent about these operators.

        Right now, FontPlatformData holds two internal CTFontRefs, and
        switching to these higher-level CFEqual() and CFHash()
        functions is required for eliminating one of these two
        internal font objects.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        Some old Macbook Pro models should never use the
        integrated GPU for WebGL, because they are unstable
        when swapping between that and the discrete GPU.

        Unfortunately this hardware configuration isn't in our

        Introducing the Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143358

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        In order to enforce layering and promote testability, WebCore/platform files
        should be compiled in their own project. This new project can enforce layering
        and can be tested with unit tests in addition to layout tests.

        The name of this new project is the Platform Abstraction Layer, or "PAL."
        This comprises of a new directory in WebCore which will be the destination
        for files migrated from WebCore/platform. This new folder, and its associated
        project, will maintain layering invariants. These invariants are enforced at
        build-time by setting the #include path for PAL to not include the rest of
        WebCore (which is the same layering enforcement mechanism for WTF). Files will
        be migrated into this new target/directory piece-by-piece, and the migration
        of a file will be performed as soon as it can be migrated without violating
        layering.

        Within WebCore, files should include PAL files using the convention
        #include <pal/foo.h>. Symbols within PAL are placed within a new top-level
        namespace, "PAL," and therefore when used should be referred to as PAL::Foo.

        The first set of files to move into the new platform is the crypto/ subdirectory
        because it is both simple but also includes platform-dependent files.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        We now comply with this part of the Web IDL specification. This adds an iterator

        Cleanup RuntimeEnabledFeatures
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167228

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        RuntimeEnabledFeatures::reset() is bad for tests. It was getting called
        after the TestRunners had set up all the Settings and RuntimeEnabledFeatures
        they expected, so it was clearing the "consistent state" set by TestRunners.

        Cleanup within RuntimeEnabledFeatures:

          - Initialize all members.
          - Remove unused features.
          - Remove reset() no longer used.
          - Document features that do not change (potentially removable).
          - Document features that are not used but have APIs (use or remove later).
          - Drop webkit prefix for these internal only apis.
          - Move things around a bit to make it more readable.
          - Enable the Fetch API by default (WebKit levels all were enabling it).

        Cleanup within Internals:

          - Move all RuntimeEnabledFeature toggling to InternalSettings
          - Save and restore these RuntimeEnabledFeatures in InternalSettings

        Fix an error which may be triggered prior to Sierra where we would assume the presentation
        mode API was avaiable when it might not be, which caused a few tests to fail.

        We also ensure that we always inject the UA styles for legacy media controls as otherwise
        toggling from modern media controls to legacy media controls would not inject those styles.
        To facilitate this we add a dedicated method for modern media controls styles in RenderTheme
        that is only used in the case of modern media controls when the shadow root asks for the styles
        to inject in the shadow root.

        REGRESSION(r206156): Animated images are repeated one extra iteration than the value which is saved in the image file
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167174

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Before r206156, BitmapImage::repetitionCount() used to return zero for
        the case loopCount = 1, -1 for loopCount = Infinity and loopCount for
        all other cases. Having repetitionCount() return zero for loopCount = 1
        makes the condition if (++m_repetitionsComplete > repetitionCount())
        break the animation loop after one iteration. But it was wrong for all
        loopCount > 1. It was causing an extra iteration to be played for the
        animated image. After r206156, BitmapImage::repetitionCount() returns
        loopCount for all cases loopCount != Infinity. Keeping the same condition
        causes the extra iteration to be played even for loopCount = 1.

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-error-crash.html

        In very specific conditions, a HTMLMediaElement backed by a MediaSource can try to remove
        the same track from its track list twice. If there are two SourceBuffers attached to a
        HTMLMediaElement, and one has not yet been initialized, when the second fails to parse an
        appended buffer after receiving an initialization segment, the HTMLMediaElement will remove
        all its tracks in mediaLoadingFailed(), then MediaSource object itself will attempt remove

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Added support for previewing password-protected documents. If a document is
        password-protected, QLPreviewConverter will call -connection:didFailWithError: with an error
        code of kQLReturnPasswordProtected. When this happens, QuickLookHandle will ask the client
        for a password, create a new QLPreviewConverter with the password specified in an options
        dictionary, and replay the buffered input data into the converter. QLPreviewConverter will
        then send the converted document data to its delegate as usual.
        
        Password entry UI will be added later; this patch implements the necessary QuickLookHandle
        logic and adds support for testing.

        Document::securityOrigin() should return a reference.
        <https://webkit.org/b/167124>

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        The security origin is always initialized by the Document constructor
        through Document::initSecurityContext(), so it's effectively always present.
        Make it return a reference and remove unnecessary null checks exposed by this.

        Document title changed twice when setting document.title
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167065

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Setting document.title would call the document title to be set twice
        first to the empty string and then to the new title. This is because
        setting document.title is equivalent to setting title.textContent [1],
        which first removes all children and then inserts the new one [2], and
        we call updateTitle() for each step. This is because
        HTMLTitleElement::childrenChanged() is called twice (once for the
        removal of the existing children, and a second time when the new child
        is inserted), and childrenChanged() calls document::titleElementTextChanged().

        Since no JS event is fired between those 2 mutations, it is safe (i.e. non
        observable from JS) to update the title only once after both mutations have
        taken place. To achieve this, add a new replaceAllChildren() function
        which implements [3]. This replaceAllChildren() has the benefit of
        calling ContainerNode::childrenChanged() only once, after both mutations
        have taken place, thus avoiding unnecessary work. This fixes the issue

        The format GL_ALPHA that can be used in WebGL's texImage2D and texSubImage2D functions is deprecated
        in the OpenGL layer when using a core profile. Due to this, when using core, we need to transform
        that parameter into something supported by OpenGL.

        What we do is to use a texture with just GL_RED format (that allows a single color component) to
        store the alpha values, and then configure the texture to swizzle red and alpha when accessing the
        pixel components.

        If NetworkStorageSession doesn't have a SoupNetworkSession yet, we are creating it only to set the
        languages. Since we already set the global value, the languages will be set when the SoupNetworkSession is
        created later. This is not a big deal for the language property, but it will be for proxies after bug #128674.
        Since NetworkStorageSession::soupNetworkSession() it's actually getting or creating the SoupNetworkSession, this
        patch renames it as NetworkStorageSession::getOrCreateSoupNetworkSession() and now
        NetworkStorageSession::soupNetworkSession() returns a pointer without creating the SoupNetworkSession, so it can

        [Cocoa] Unify FontPlatformData's hashing and equality operators
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167061

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        On iOS, we were using CFEqual() and CFHash(), while on macOS
        we were using pointer hashing and pointer equality. Instead,
        we should be consistent about these operators.

        Right now, FontPlatformData holds two internal CTFontRefs, and
        switching to these higher-level CFEqual() and CFHash()
        functions is required for eliminating one of these two
        internal font objects.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        [Cocoa] Unify font fallback between macOS and iOS for when the font-family list is exhausted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167056

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When performing font fallback, each item in the font-family list is examined.
        If no appropriate fonts are found, WebKit asks the system for an appropriate
        font. As of a few years ago, both macOS and iOS used platform calls to
        produce a font; however, each platform used a different platform call. This
        patch migrates both platforms to use a shared function which uses only
        one of the platform calls (which means the other platform call is never used). 

        There are still some behavior differences between macOS and iOS (which are now
        hidden behind a PLATFORM() guard), but I'd like to minimize and eliminate these
        in the future. Using a shared function is a step toward this goal. 

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        so we can get move semantics for converted values that come out in
        an optional. Added call to forwardInheritedValue (see above).

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::pageSizeAndMarginsInPixels): Use auto and update

        use auto, pass references.

        * platform/KeyedCoding.h: Return RefPtr instead of PassRefPtr.

        * platform/LengthBox.h: Added a constructor that moves the lengths in, rather
        than always copying them.

        Add diagnostic logging to measure high performance WebGL usage. We report
        at regular intervals in which WebGL state Safari is:
        - Inactive
        - ActiveInForegroundTab
        - ActiveInBackgroundTabOnly

        This should give us an estimate of:
        - What % of the time is Safari using high performance graphics
        - What % of this time is only due to background tabs

        No new tests, no Web-facing behavior change.

        Protect MediaPlayer from being destroyed mid-load()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166976

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        It's possible for a message sent by MediaPlayer to HTMLMediaElement to cause
        MediaPlayer to be destroyed before MediaPlayer::load() completes. We have
        previously protected against this same problem in HTMLMediaElement::loadResource()
        by ref'ing at the beginning of the function and deref'ing on exit. To do the
        same in MediaPlayer, it must become RefCounted.

        To keep the same semantics about m_client in MediaPlayer (always available without
        requiring a null-check), make a new static MediaPlayerClient object which can
        replace the real (HTMLMediaElement) client when the MediaPlayer is invalidated.

        object about the accelerated compositing capabilities. Instead, cache this information
        when creating the video sink (which is most affected by this information anyway), storing
        it in a new protected boolean member variable in the MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase class.

        All calls to MediaPlayerClient::mediaPlayerRenderingCanBeAccelerated() and
        MediaPlayerClient::mediaPlayerAcceleratedCompositingEnabled() are replaced by tests
        on the value of this new member variable.

        Report post-page load CPU usage using diagnostic logging

        Shortly after page load (5 seconds), we measure the WebContent process'
        CPU usage over 10 seconds and report the percentage back via release
        logging. We also log the percentage using diagnostic logging using the
        following buckets:
        - Below 10%
        - 10 to 20%
        - 20 to 40%
        - 60 to 80%
        - Over 80%

        The logging works on both Mac and iOS. I verified that I get results
        consistent with Activity Monitor or top.

        No new tests, no Web-facing behavior change, only extra logging.

        [SOUP] Simplify cookie storage handling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166967

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        We currently have a global cookie storage, and several create() methods in SoupNetworkSession to create sessions
        with different cookie jars. This could be simplified by moving the cookie storage handling to
        NetworkStorageSession and removing all create() methods from SoupNetworkSession. This patch also removes the
        default SoupNetworkSession in favor of using the default NetworkStorageSession.

        * platform/network/NetworkStorageSession.h: Add a default cookie storage to be used when the
        NetworkStorageSession doesn't have a platform soup session.

        [iOS] HTML form validation popover sometimes does not go away

        <rdar://problem/29985957>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The issue was that [UIViewController presentViewController:] is asynchronous
        and that we sometimes tried to call [m_popoverController dismissViewControllerAnimated:]
        before presentViewController had completed. This is something that UIKit does
        not handle nicely and the popover just stays visible even though we have
        asked for the controller to be dismissed and destroyed the ValidationBubble
        object.

        To address the issue, I made ValidationBubble RefCounted and make sure the
        ValidationBubble object stays alive at least until the completion handler for
        [UIViewController presentViewController:] has been called. This is done via
        protecting the object using a RefPtr<> and capturing it in the lambda.
        Because dismissViewControllerAnimated is called in the destructor, it is no
        longer possible to call dismissViewControllerAnimated before the call to
        presentViewController has completed.

        No new tests, no easily testable since the popover was staying visible
        after being destroyed (held on by UIKit).

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        It's possible for a message sent by MediaPlayer to HTMLMediaElement to cause
        MediaPlayer to be destroyed before MediaPlayer::load() completes. We have
        previously protected against this same problem in HTMLMediaElement::loadResource()
        by ref'ing at the beginning of the function and deref'ing on exit. To do the
        same in MediaPlayer, it must become RefCounted.

        To keep the same semantics about m_client in MediaPlayer (always available without
        requiring a null-check), make a new static MediaPlayerClient object which can
        replace the real (HTMLMediaElement) client when the MediaPlayer is invalidated.

        [GTK] WebKitWebProcess at 100% CPU loading hyphenation dictionaries
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165601

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        In HyphenationLibHyphen, retrieve the canonicalized absolute pathname of the dictionary file
        in order to avoid storing symbolic links as the target files for specific locales. libhyphen
        distributes its dictionary files by linking a set of similar locales files to a single file.
        Not resolving those symbolic links means we'll be opening a single file via multiple
        HyphenationDictionary objects, which is far from optimal.

        To add insult to injury, these HyphenationDictionary objects were stored in a TinyLRUCache
        with a slim capacity of 4. This meant that while already loading one single file through
        multiple symlinks, because of continuous eviciton from this LRU cache the same symlinks
        continued to be processed, in some cases resulting in opening the same dictionary file
        hundreds or thousands of times. The capacity of this TinyLRUCache is increased to 32
        to keep the amount of open libhyphen dictionaries capped at some reasonable number.

        [css-grid] Make the grid sizing data persistent through layouts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166883

        Reviewed by Darin Adler and Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        We want to keep the grid sizing data structures through different
        layouts. This will allow to optimize some operations, reusing
        these data while still valid. Additionally, operations like
        determining the baseline position when the grid container is under
        an inline formatting context need these data once the grid has
        been laid out.

        This patch controls the sizing data validity and make the data
        structures persistent after layout.

        Implement InlineClassicScript
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166925

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        As of r210585, ScriptFetcher functionality is decoupled from ScriptElement.
        This patch is a further cleanup. We introduce InlineClassicScript, which is
        similar to LoadableClassicScript / LoadableModuleScript. And we move ScriptFetcher
        functionality from LoadableScript to CachedScriptFetcher, which is the base
        class of InlineClassicScript and LoadableScript.

        And we start setting this CachedScriptFetcher to the member of JSC::SourceOrigin.
        This allows us to examine the ScriptFetcher from the SourceOrigin.
        When dynamic-import operator is called, we need to get the ScriptFetcher from the
        caller script SourceOrigin since the subsequent module loading needs to know the
        metadata about fetching and ScriptFetcher delivers it.

        No behavior change.

        Ordinarily, we don't process empty BiDi runs (because we filter them out).
        However, when using isolates, we invoke extra machinery to create a
        placeholder BiDi run, and replace it with the runs for the isolate. The
        isolate's runs, though, can be empty, and rather than just deleting the
        placeholder run, we will keep it around so that the m_logicallyLastRun is
        still valid. This means that it is possible when all is said and done to
        have empty runs, and computeInlineDirectionPositionsForSegment() needs to
        not ASSERT() in this case.

        Decouple module loading initiator from ScriptElement
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166888

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Ryosuke Niwa.

        Previously, we use ScriptElement (JSElement for ScriptElement) as the module loading initiator.
        This element is used to transfer the metadata like charset throughout the module pipeline.
        As a result, our module loader in the browser side is tightly coupled with ScriptElement.
        It is not good since it prevent us from using the module loader in the non-DOM environment like
        Web Workers.

        So we decouple the necessary informations from ScriptElement. We move these information to
        LoadableScript. And we use JSScriptFetcher to transfer LoadableScript through the JS implemented
        module loader pipeline. We select LoadableScript instead of LoadableModuleScript since this initiator
        information will be leveraged even in classic scripts once we implement the dynamic import.

        No behavior change.

        The bug was caused by updateHoverActiveState not updating :hover and :active states on elements
        when nodes are assigned to slots because they were walking up the tree using parentOrShadowHostElement

        Implement "proximity" scroll snapping
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135994
        <rdar://problem/18162418>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Adds support for proximity scroll snapping. To do this, we introduce scroll offset ranges, a list of scroll
        offset ranges that are plumbed alongside the list of scroll snap offsets. Similar to a snap offset, a snap
        offset range contains scroll offsets on which scrolling is allowed to come to a rest within a scroll snapping
        container. However, unlike normal snap offsets, scrolling may only come to rest within a snap offset range if
        the predicted scroll offset already lies within the range. The new algorithm for selecting a target scroll snap
        position given a destination offset is now:

        -   If the scroll destination lies within a snap offset range, return the scroll destination
        -   Otherwise, compute the nearest lower/upper snap offsets and lower/upper snap offset ranges
        -   If scrolling ended with no velocity, return the nearest snap offset
        -   If scrolling ended with positive velocity, choose the upper snap offset only if there is no snap offset
            range in between the scroll destination and the snap offset; else, choose the lower snap offset
        -   If scrolling ended with negative velocity, choose the lower snap offset only if there is no snap offset
            range in between the scroll destination and the snap offset; else, choose the upper snap offset

        The extra rule accounting for scroll offset ranges in between the scroll destination and a potential snap offset
        handles the corner case where the user scrolls with momentum very lightly away from a snap offset, such that the
        predicted scroll destination is still within proximity of the snap offset. In this case, the regular (mandatory
        scroll snapping) behavior would be to snap to the next offset in the direction of momentum scrolling, but
        instead, it is more intuitive to return to the original snap position.

        We also move scrolling prediction logic into ScrollingMomentumCalculator and adopt the platform
        _NSScrollingMomentumCalculator's destinationOrigin property when computing the predicted scroll destination.
        Previously, we were simply multiplying by an empirically-derived constant to approximate the scroll destination,
        but now that we are supporting proximity scroll snapping, we need more exact scroll destinaton prediction in
        order to make sure that scrolling to a snap offset range feels natural.

        Adjust the snap offset selection algorithm to take snap offset ranges into account. See above for more details.
        Additionally, augment snap offset update logic to emit snap offset ranges for proximity scroll snapping. To do
        this, we run the following steps on the final list of processed snap offsets:
        -   Compute the proximity distance, which (for now) is arbitrarily 0.3 * the length or width of the scroll snap
            port, depending on whether scroll snapping is taking place in the X or Y axis.
        -   For each pair of adjacent snap offsets, if they are more than 2 * proximity distance away from each other,
            emit a snap offset range starting from (lower snap offset + proximity distance) and ending on (upper snap
            offset + proximity distance).

        Currently, the ScrollingMomentumCalculator is responsible for taking an initial position, initial velocity, and
        target position and animating the scroll offset from the initial to target position. Now, we refactor the
        ScrollingMomentumCalculator interface to no longer take a target offset upon initialization, and instead compute
        the predicted scroll destination given initial position and velocity; clients of the ScrollingMomentumCalculator
        then use this predicted scroll destination to compute a retargeted scroll offset and then call
        setRetargetedScrollOffset on the calculator, which sets up an animation curve to the new retargeted offset. This
        allows both the AppKit-based scrolling momentum calculator and platform-invariant momentum calculator to be used
        interchangeably, while still allowing them to compute a destination offset from initial parameters of the
        scroll.

        [CoordinatedGraphics] TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy is constantly getting activated
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166856

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        When CoordinatedGraphicsLayer::setContentsNeedsDisplay() is called, currently with
        the threaded CoordinatedGraphics mode the platform layer is marked for synchronizing.
        This means that at flush-time this layer swaps the buffer of the wrapped platform
        layer and updates the layer state to indicate that the underlying
        TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy object has to be activated on the composition thread.

        This current logic results in the TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy object being
        reactivated for every display request that arrives via setContentsNeedsDisplay().
        This is pretty wasteful since this activation heap-allocates a RunLoop::Timer object
        which internally also locks up the GLib main context to attach a new source, and
        that's only after the source on the previous RunLoop::Timer was detached before
        that RunLoop::Timer was destroyed.

        To avoid this, CoordinatedGraphicsLayer::setContentsNeedsDisplay() sets a new flag,
        m_shouldUpdatePlatformLayer. During flush, this flag is checked in
        CoordinatedGraphicsLayer::updatePlatformLayer(), with the buffer swap performed in
        case it's set. CoordinatedGraphicsLayer::syncPlatformLayer() now only sets the
        platform layer proxy object for that layer's state.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Stop using .INTERMEDIATE in DerivedSources.make was it seems to break dependency
        chains for some reason. We started using .INTERMEDIATE for scripts that generate
        several targets when run a single time. It avoided running the script several
        times (once per target) unnecessarily, and fixed issues with parallel builds.

        To address the same issue without using .INTERMEDIATE, we now use pattern rules
        (i.e. rules that have '%'). As per the documentation [1]:
        "Pattern rules may have more than one target. Unlike normal rules, this does not
         act as many different rules with the same prerequisites and recipe. If a pattern
         rule has multiple targets, make knows that the rule’s recipe is responsible for
         making all of the targets. The recipe is executed only once to make all the
         targets".

         We are therefore solving the same problem as with .INTERMEDIATE. However, I have
         confirmed that using pattern rules does not break dependency chains. For example,
         modifying Settings.in re-generates both InternalSettingsGenerated.idl *and*
         JSInternalSettingsGenerated.cpp.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166713

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        QuickLook conversion was originally implemented by intercepting document loads at the
        ResourceHandle level, with separate paths for NSURLConnection and CFURLConnection handles.
        When QuickLook was ported to WebKit2, a third path was added in WebResourceLoader.
        
        This change removes these three separate paths and implements a single conversion path in
        SubresourceLoader, where QuickLook can intercept document loads regardless of the networking
        API being used.

        AVFoundation can potentially call the same boundary time observer multiple times, and
        in that case, it's possible that the observer queue will be empty when we attempt
        to remove the first item from the queue. There's an ASSERT() in Deque for this case,

        Regression(r189230): DOM Callbacks may use wrong global object

        Finding text doesn't work across shadow boundary
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158503

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Added a new TextIterator behavior flag, TextIteratorTraversesFlatTree, which makes TextIterator traverse
        the flat tree instead of the DOM tree, and made this behavior default in findPlainText.

        Also added a new find options flag, DoNotTraverseFlatTree, to suppress this behavior in window.find(~)
        and execCommand('FindString', false, ~) as they should not be able to peek information inside shadow trees.
        Unfortunately these APIs have been deprecated in the standards so there is no specification to follow.

        For now, we don't support finding a word or a keyword across a shadow boundary as this would require
        making rangeOfString and other related functions return a Range-like object that can cross shadow boundaries.

        Also added internals.rangeOfString to test Editor::rangeOfString, and replaced the bit-flag arguments
        to internals.countMatchesForText and internals.countFindMatches by an array of strings for better portability.

        We normally attach floating boxes to the last root linebox. However when the floatbox is preceded by a <br>
        we generate a dedicated root linebox (TrailingFloatsRootInlineBox) for the floatbox.
        When this floatbox is a RenderInline descendant and this RenderInline does not generate lineboxes (it's ancestor RenderBlockFlow does)
        we have to make sure that this special root linebox gets marked dirty when the associated floatbox changes.
        (Unfortunately through the recursive calls on dirtyLinesFromChangedChild(), we lose the information about
        the "changed child" since the inlines propagates the marking logic to the RenderBlockFlow, see FIXME.)

        REGRESSION(r210226): overflow:scroll scroll position not restored on back navigation
        <https://webkit.org/b/166724>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Before r210226, the render tree being torn down and the document being destroyed
        were roughly the same thing, since they would always happen together, from the
        render tree's perspective.

        Changing this caused us to skip over the code that saves the scroll position
        for an element's RenderLayer when going into the page cache. Navigating back to
        that page would then scroll the layer to (0,0) instead of the previous position.

        The fix is simply to remove the check for documentBeingDestroyed() in ~RenderLayer().
        Note that two checks are being removed, there was also a weird "optimization"
        to avoid nulling out EventHandler's m_resizeLayer if it points to this layer.
        That pointer would eventually get nulled out in EventHandler::clear() anyway,
        but it feels better to not let that pointer dangle.

        (WebCore::ScriptElement::ref): Added. Forwards ref/deref to the underlying element
        so we can use Ref and RefPtr with this class.
        (WebCore::ScriptElement::deref): Ditto.
        (WebCore::isScriptElement): Added. Replaces one of the two uses of
        toScriptElementIfPossible, and is similar in style to is<Element>.
        (WebCore::downcastScriptElement): Ditto, but for downcast.
        * dom/ScriptElement.h: Updated for above changes.

        * dom/ScriptRunner.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScriptRunner::queueScriptForExecution): Take reference rather than
        pointer, and pass ScriptElement rather than Element.
        (WebCore::ScriptRunner::notifyFinished): Ditto.
        (WebCore::ScriptRunner::timerFired): Ditto.
        * dom/ScriptRunner.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/FileInputType.cpp:
        (WebCore::FileInputType::files): Updated since m_fileList is a Ref.
        (WebCore::FileInputType::createFileList): Updated to return a Ref instead of
        a PassRefPtr. Also use reserveInitialCapacity/uncheckedAppend.
        (WebCore::FileInputType::requestIcon): Updated since the updateRendering
        function is now called iconLoaded. Also use references instead of pointers.
        (WebCore::FileInputType::setFiles): Take a RefPtr&& insted of a PassRefPtr.
        Also put some conditional code inside an #if.
        (WebCore::FileInputType::filesChosen): Updated for function name change.
        (WebCore::FileInputType::iconLoaded): Renamed from updateRendering.
        Changed argument to RefPtr&& from PassRefPtr.
        (WebCore::FileInputType::defaultToolTip): Got rid of unneeded local variable
        and used the correct type, unsigned, rather than size_t.
        * html/FileInputType.h: Updated for the above changes, use final instead
        of override, and use Ref instead of RefPtr.

        * html/HTMLElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLElement::form): Renamed from virtualForm.
        * html/HTMLElement.h: Replaced the form/virtualForm pair of functions with
        just a form function. The old design dates back before we had "final" for
        virtual functions, and now we can just use that instead.

        * html/HTMLFormControlElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::virtualForm): Deleted.
        * html/HTMLFormControlElement.h: Mark the form function final, since it's
        now both an inline function in this class, and an override of a virtual
        function inherited from the base class. Deleted the virtualForm function.

        * html/HTMLInputElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::defaultEventHandler): Removed use of the
        formForSubmission function, which was just another way to get the same
        thing as the form function; perhaps they were different in the past.
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::setFiles): Take a RefPtr&& rather than a PassRefPtr.
        * html/HTMLInputElement.h: Updated for the above.

        * html/HTMLLabelElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLLabelElement::control): Made this const.
        (WebCore::HTMLLabelElement::form): Made this const, so it can be used to
        override the const form function from the base class.
        * html/HTMLLabelElement.h: Marked the form function final, since we want it
        to override the form function inherited from HTMLElement.

        * html/HTMLLegendElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLLegendElement::form): Renamed from virtualForm.
        * html/HTMLLegendElement.h: Override form instead of virtualForm and mark it final
        This makes things more efficient if someone calls form directly on this class;
        before it would make an unnecessary virtual function call.

        * html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::TrackDisplayUpdateScope::TrackDisplayUpdateScope): Take a reference
        rather than a pointer.
        (WebCore::TrackDisplayUpdateScope::~TrackDisplayUpdateScope): Ditto.
        (WebCore::eventTimeCueCompare): Compare the cues the same way the cue list would
        rather than using cueIndex.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::audioTrackEnabledChanged): Take a reference.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::textTrackModeChanged): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::videoTrackSelectedChanged): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::textTrackKindChanged): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::textTrackAddCues): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::textTrackRemoveCues): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::textTrackAddCue): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::textTrackRemoveCue): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::mediaPlayerDidAddAudioTrack): Pass references.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::mediaPlayerDidAddTextTrack): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::mediaPlayerDidAddVideoTrack): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::removeTextTrack): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::forgetResourceSpecificTracks): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::setController): Take a RefPtr&& instead of PassRefPtr.
        * html/HTMLMediaElement.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/HTMLObjectElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::virtualForm): Deleted.
        * html/HTMLObjectElement.h: Made the form function inline and final, which
        achieves the same thing we did before with using, but without requiring the
        separate virtualForm function, now deleted.

        * html/HTMLOptionElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLOptionElement::collectOptionInnerText): Use isScriptElement
        instead of toScriptElementIfPossible.

        * html/HTMLPlugInElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInElement::bindingsInstance): Renamed from getInstance and
        changed the return type to a raw pointer.
        * html/HTMLPlugInElement.h: Updated for the above changes. Also changed the
        updateSnapshot function to take a raw pointer instead of a PassRefPtr.

        * html/HTMLPlugInImageElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::createElementRenderer): Pass a pointer
        to updateSnapshot.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::updateSnapshot): Updated to take a raw
        pointer instead of a PassRefPtr.
        * html/HTMLPlugInImageElement.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/HTMLScriptElement.h: Added using to resolve the ambiguity with the
        ref/deref from HTMLElement and from ScriptElement.

        * html/HTMLTextFormControlElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLTextFormControlElement::selection): Return a RefPtr instead
        of a PassRefPtr.

        (WebCore::HTMLTrackElement::textTrackAddCue): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLTrackElement::textTrackRemoveCue): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLTrackElement.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/InputType.cpp:
        (WebCore::InputType::formForSubmission): Deleted.
        (WebCore::InputType::setFiles): Take a RefPtr&& instead of a PassRefPtr.
        * html/InputType.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/PluginDocument.cpp:
        (WebCore::PluginDocumentParser::createDocumentStructure): Pass a reference.
        (WebCore::PluginDocument::setPluginElement): Take a reference rather than
        a PassRefPtr.
        * html/PluginDocument.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.cpp:
        (WebCore::CanvasRenderingContext2D::setStrokeStyle): Pass a reference.
        (WebCore::CanvasRenderingContext2D::setFillStyle): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CanvasRenderingContext2D::drawTextInternal): Ditto.

        * html/canvas/CanvasStyle.cpp:
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::CanvasStyle): Rewrite all constructors to use the
        m_style variant instead of separate m_type and other data members. Also
        change from PassRefPtr to a reference.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::createFromString): Update to use the variant.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::createFromStringWithOverrideAlpha): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::isEquivalentColor): Ditto.

        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::isEquivalentCMYKA): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::CanvasStyle): Deleted copy constructor; the compiler
        can now generate a correct copy or move constructor.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::~CanvasStyle): Deleted. Compiler generates this
        properly now without help from us.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::operator=): Deleted. The compiler can now generate
        a correct copy of move assignment operator.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::applyStrokeColor): Updated to take a reference and
        use the variant.
        (WebCore::CanvasStyle::applyFillColor): Ditto.

        * html/canvas/CanvasStyle.h: Redid this class to use a variant instead of
        a type enumeration and a union.

        * html/canvas/OESVertexArrayObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::OESVertexArrayObject::createVertexArrayOES): Updated use of enum
        since it's now an enum class.

        * html/canvas/WebGL2RenderingContext.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::WebGL2RenderingContext): Use Ref&& instead of
        RefPtr&& for the GraphicsContext3D.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::initializeVertexArrayObjects): Updated enum
        and also use references.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getInternalformatParameter): Use nullptr to
        return null rather than the old idiom (default-constructed WebGLGetInfo).
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::texStorage2D): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getQueryParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getSamplerParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getSyncParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getIndexedParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getActiveUniformBlockParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getActiveUniformBlockName): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::createVertexArray): Updated enum and also
        use reference.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getExtension): Rearranged logic in three ways:
        (1) Moved checks for whether an extension is supported inside the case for that
        extension, rather than combining the extension name check with the extensions
        enabled check. (2) Used the new enableSupportedExtension function to simplify
        many of the checks to avoid repeating the extension name twice. (3) Changed the
        idiom so we set the pointers to nullptr explicitly, preparing for a future where
        we might make the extension pointers use std::optional so we can cache a negative
        for each extension too, not just a positive result.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getSupportedExtensions): Use ASCIILiteral.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getFramebufferAttachmentParameter): Use nullptr
        as above. For non-null types, return the object without converting, letting the
        WebGLAny class handle things, except for enumerations, which we need to explicitly
        static_cast to an integral type, and things that will be stored in the variant in
        a RefPtr, where we use makeRefPtr.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::validateFramebufferFuncParameters):
        Simplified and clarified the handling of COLOR_ATTACHMENT.
        (WebCore::WebGL2RenderingContext::getParameter): Return WebGLAny, same idiom as
        described above for getFramebufferAttachmentParameter.
        * html/canvas/WebGL2RenderingContext.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/canvas/WebGLAny.cpp: Added.
        (WebCore::toJS): Handles conversion to JavaScript types. This function is based
        on the existing toJS functions from the two classes that were using WebGLGetInfo.
        Eventually we can probably just get the bindings to automatically generate this,
        but there is some work to do to get to that point.
        * html/canvas/WebGLAny.h: Added. This type, a variant, replaces the WebGLGetInfo
        class. Also includes the toJS function, which is the real point of this type, since
        it's about returning a variant mapped appropriately to JavaScript types.

        * html/canvas/WebGLContextGroup.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebGLContextGroup::getAGraphicsContext3D): Changed to return a reference.
        Droped unnecessary local variable with a long type name.

        local variable with a long type name.

        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::WebGLRenderingContext): Take a Ref&& instead
        of as PassRefPtr.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::initializeVertexArrayObjects): Updated enum
        and also use references.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::getExtension): Rearranged logic in three ways:
        (1) Moved checks for whether an extension is supported inside the case for that
        extension, rather than combining the extension name check with the extensions
        enabled check. (2) Used the new enableSupportedExtension function to simplify
        many of the checks to avoid repeating the extension name twice. (3) Changed the
        idiom so we set the pointers to nullptr explicitly, preparing for a future where
        we might make the extension pointers use std::optional so we can cache a negative
        for each extension too, not just a positive result.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::getSupportedExtensions): Use ASCIILiteral.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::getFramebufferAttachmentParameter): Use nullptr
        as above. For non-null types, return the object without converting, letting the
        WebGLAny class handle things, except for enumerations, which we need to explicitly
        static_cast to an integral type, and things that will be stored in the variant in
        a RefPtr, where we use makeRefPtr.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::validateFramebufferFuncParameters):
        Simplified and clarified the handling of COLOR_ATTACHMENT adding a FIXME about
        something questionable.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContext::getParameter): Return WebGLAny, same idiom as
        described above for getFramebufferAttachmentParameter.
        * html/canvas/WebGLRenderingContext.h: Updated for above changes.

        * html/canvas/WebGLRenderingContextBase.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::create): Updated to pass references
        instead of pointers in a couple cases
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::WebGLRenderingContextBase): Changed graphics
        context argument type from RefPtr&& to Ref&&. Also moved initialization of scalars
        from the constructor to the class definition.

        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::deleteBuffer): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getBufferParameter): Update to use WebGLAny.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getProgramParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getRenderbufferParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getShaderParameter): Ditto.

        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::addContextObject): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getBooleanParameter): Changed return type;
        connversion to WebGLAny can happen at the point of use.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getBooleanArrayParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getFloatParameter): Ditto.

        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::getWebGLIntArrayParameter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::validateBufferDataParameters): Use
        optional to simplify logic and get rid of a boolean.
        (WebCore::WebGLRenderingContextBase::enableSupportedExtension): Added.
        Helper used by the getExtension functions.
        * html/canvas/WebGLRenderingContextBase.h: Updated for the above changes.

        (WebCore::WebGLSharedObject::detachContextGroup): Ditto.

        [Cocoa] Teach SharedBuffer to return an NSArray of data segments to avoid flattening
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166696

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Existing methods of extracting NSData from a SharedBuffer require either merging or copying
        data segments. Since data segments are stored in CFDataRefs on Cocoa platforms, it should be
        possible to retrieve an NSArray of the segments without having to first flatten to a single
        buffer.

        This patch implements such a method. This will be used in a follow-on patch, where I will
        need to pass SharedBuffer data to QuickLook via an NSArray of NSData.

        New API test: SharedBufferTest.createNSDataArray.

        * platform/SharedBuffer.h: Declared createNSArrayData(), and exported two functions needed
        by the API test.
        * platform/cocoa/SharedBufferCocoa.mm:
        (WebCore::SharedBuffer::createNSDataArray): Added. Returns m_cfData or a copy of m_fileData
        if either exist. Otherwise, adds m_buffer (wrapped in a WebCoreSharedBufferData object) and
        the objects in m_dataArray to a NSMutableArray and returns it.

        Correct DOMWindow handling during FrameLoader::clear

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        Make sure that we always clean up the DOM window when clearing Window properties, even if the document will
        remain in the page cache. Since 'clearWindowShell' is only used in FrameLoader, divide it's beahvior into
        two steps:
        
        1. Rename 'clearWindowShell' to 'clearWIndowShellsNotMatchingDOMWindow' to better describe its function.
        Switch to a modern C++ loop. Do not switch to the new DOMWindow here, but detach and clear existing
        DOMWindow connections.

        2. Add a new method 'setDOMWindowForWindowShell'. Complete switch to the new DOMWindow.

        This change allows us to disconnect the old DOMWindow, perform the 'setDocument(nullptr)' operation, and then
        connect to the new Window without leaving the loader in an inconsistent state.

        We were mistakenly calling Document::addWindowNamedItem() / Document::removeWindowNamedItem()
        for elements in Shadow DOMs. As a result, the windowNamedItem DocumentOrderedMap would
        contain elements in shadow DOMs. This would cause the assertion to be hit in window's
        named property getter because of the length mismatch between the windowNamedItem
        DocumentOrderedMap and the WindowNameCollection.

        label element with tabindex >= 0 is not focusable

        <rdar://problem/29796608>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Fixed the bug by removing the override for HTMLLabelElement::isFocusable which always returned false.

        This is a behavior from r5532 but it doesn't match the latest HTML specification or that of Chrome
        and Firefox.

        Also fixed an existing bug in HTMLLabelElement::focus and HTMLLegendElement::focus which focused
        the associated form control when there is one even if the element itself is focusable. Without this fix,
        traversing from control with shift+tab would break since focusing the label would move the focus back
        to the input element inside the label element.

        Finally, fixed a bug in HTMLLegendElement::focus that we can call inFocus without updating layout first.

        The fix was inspired by https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/085ad8697b1be50c4f93e296797a25a43a79bcfb

        The problem was that tearDownRenderers() would cause commit Widget hierarchy updates
        before returning, which is just before Document clears its m_renderView pointer.
        This led to an awkward callback into Page::setActivityState() which ended up trying
        to clear the selection inside a partially dead render tree.

        Fix this by adding a WidgetHierarchyUpdatesSuspensionScope to Document::destroyRenderTree()
        which ensures that Widget updates don't happen until after Document::m_renderView is cleared.

        Placeholder style mechanism leaks CSSFontSelector for first Document styled.
        <https://webkit.org/b/166652>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The placeholder style is used when we're resolving style for a non-rendered
        element, or any element before stylesheets have loaded.

        An old optimization had us reusing the same style each time, which meant that
        since it was initialized with a font selector the first time, it kept that
        font selector alive forever.

        As we have to clone the style anyway, fix this by just making a new style
        each time, using the current document's font selector.

        (WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::supportedPropertyNames): Added this.
        Old version just had an empty placeholder.
        * dom/DOMNamedFlowCollection.h: Changed to no longer use ListHashSet, not
        the right data structure for this. Removed incorrect use of "long" and
        made some other simplifications.
        * dom/DOMNamedFlowCollection.idl: Changed return types of item and namedItem
        to accurately reflect the fact that they return null when the index or name
        not found in the collection.

        * dom/DataTransfer.h: Remove indentation. Remove unimplemented
        incorrect declarations of items for ENABLE(DATA_TRANSFER_ITEMS).
        Will be added back when someone implements that feature, or perhaps
        ENABLE(DATA_TRANSFER_ITEMS) should be entirely removed for now?

        * dom/DataTransferItem.h: Changed return type for getAsFile to
        RefPtr. Again, part of ENABLE(DATA_TRANSFER_ITEMS), so dead code for now.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::canonicalizedTitle): Removed incorrect comment claiming we
        convert control characters to spaces. Simplified logic, removing two
        extra loops. Changed to work on just a String rather than StringWithDirection.
        (WebCore::Document::updateTitle): Updated to call the function above.
        Also updated since StringWithDirection is now a struct instead of a class.
        Call displayBuffer on the encoding directly instead of calling a member
        function named displayBufferModifiedByEncoding.
        (WebCore::Document::updateTitleFromTitleElement): Updated since
        StringWithDirection is now a struct.
        (WebCore::Document::setTitle): Removed code that unnecessarily calls
        updateTitle twice; once indirectly by calling setTextContent on the
        title elmeent and once by directly calling updateTitle.

        * dom/EventContext.h: Removed unnecessary includes and forward declarations.
        Changed setRelatedTarget to take a raw pointer instead of PassRefPtr since
        callers aren't passing ownership. Moved TouchEventContext::touchList body
        out of the class definition since it's a bit long. Deleted unused

        * dom/NamedFlowCollection.cpp:
        (WebCore::NamedFlowCollection::createCSSOMSnapshot): Pass a vector of Ref
        instead of a vector of raw pointers and pass it as an rvalue reference so
        it can be taken over by the named flow collection wrapper.

        [EFL] fix buffer over-read in RenderThemeEfl::mediaControlsStyleSheet()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166622

        Reviewed by Gyuyoung Kim.

        This has been detected by a charactersAreAllASCII() assert failure.
        Initially in WebKitForWayland (WPE), but the code was likely borrowed from EFL.

        This is because ASCIILiteral() is wrongly used in mediaControlsStyleSheet().
        mediaControlsBaseUserAgentStyleSheet is a char array, not a null-terminated string.
        It is thus incorrect to use StringImpl::createFromLiteral() that calls
        strlen() to get the string length.

        The String::ConstructFromLiteral constructor can not be used, since it
        skips the last character.

        (WebCore::RenderThemeEfl::mediaControlsStyleSheet):
        Explicitely pass the size to the String constructor.

        [css-grid] Isolate instrinsic size computation from layout
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166530

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This is the last patch of the items placement data refactoring. By using a different Grid
        instance in computeIntrinsicLogicalWidths we effectively isolate the intrinsic size
        computation from the layout. They are now using different data structures so they don't
        interfere each other.

        This also means that we no longer reuse the placement of items done in the intrinsic size
        computation. That shouldn't be a big issue once we make m_grid persistent on RenderGrid.

        Last but not least, this patch finally removes the ugly const_cast's we had in
        computeIntrinsicLogicalWidths() as we no longer modify the internal state of RenderGrid.

        Using the macOS quirk rather than the Chrome quirk for Google domains was a mistake: it
        broke Hangouts in a different way than the Chrome quirk, and also prevents use of the nice

        Eventually I settled on the combination of two quirks: (1) Firefox browser, and (2) Linux

        [css-grid] Move Grid into GridSizingData
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165654

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The grid track sizing algorithm has been using the m_grid attribute from RenderGrid to
        compute the sizes of the tracks unconditionally. However the goal is to make it work against
        a generic instance of the Grid class, so that the intrinsic size computation and the layout
        processes could be effectively decoupled.

        Instead of passing the Grid as a new argument to all the track sizing algorithm methods we
        leverage the existence of GridSizingData which is already passed to all of them. This data
        structure holds from now on a reference to the Grid instance so that the track sizing
        algorithm could use it.

        No new tests as this is a refactoring.

        r209299 broke autoscroll in zoomed pages because it changed RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible()
        to shrink viewRect by page scale. This is incorrect for all callers of scrollRectToVisible, since
        the "absoluteRect" passed in is actually in zoomed document coordinates for all the callers I tested.

        This code is also fixed to account for headers and footers. getRectToExpose() takes rectangles
        in "scroll view contents" coordinates (i.e. including header, and zoomed document), so doesn't need
        the separate visibleRectRelativeToDocument parameter.

        Currently, the only reason scroll snapping works in overflow scrolling containers without forcing layout is
        because we would initialize the scrolling container's ScrollAnimator in the process of updating scrollbars. If
        there are no scrollbars to render, we won't bother creating a ScrollAnimator. Without an existing
        ScrollAnimator, ScrollableArea::updateScrollSnapState will simply bail instead of setting up the scroll snap
        state. Instead, we should take setting a non-empty vector of scroll offsets on the ScrollableArea as a cue that
        the ScrollableArea also needs a ScrollAnimator, and initialize it there if necessary.

        The computation of the visual viewport was wrong in the presence of header and footer
        banners. It needs to take into account the fact that "visibleContentRect" applies to the
        scroll view contents, which includes header and footer (unscaled), and the potentially scaled
        document, and we need to return a rectangle in unscaled document coordinates.
        
        Make a static method in FrameView to do this computation, and call it from FrameView::visualViewportRect()
        and ScrollingTreeFrameScrollingNode::layoutViewportForScrollPosition().
        
        layoutViewportForScrollPosition() is only called on Mac, so remove the #ifdeffing related to scaling, 
        and pass in an unscaled scroll position.

        Test: fast/text/variations/default-value.html

        This patch inspects the font's information regarding variations. It uses this information
        to work around a bug in CoreText where default variation values were not getting applied.
        This workaround is placed behind a version check and the macro name
        "WORKAROUND_CORETEXT_VARIATIONS_DEFAULT_VALUE_BUG" so we know to delete it whenever
        possible. It also uses the minimum and maximum supported values for the axis to clamp our
        variation values to the closest supported point, which is in line with a recent edit to
        the fonts spec:

        Parsing scroll-snap-align is straightforward -- we either have one or two values in the set {none, start,

        Overhauled updateSnapOffsetsForScrollableArea to work with the new scroll snapping model. In the new way of
        computing scroll snap offsets, we:

        Compute the scroll container's scroll snap port, which is the padding box inset by the scroll padding
        For each child with snap positions (i.e. scroll-snap-align is not none on both axes)
          Compute the child's scroll snap area, which is the bounding box of the transformed border box
            If the container snaps along the horizontal axis and the snap area contributes a horizontal snap offset:
              Emit the distance from the alignment offset in the horizontal of the snap port to the corresponding offset
              in the snap area as a snap position.
            If the container snaps along the vertical axis and the snap area contributes a vertical snap offset:
              Emit the distance from the alignment offset in the vertical of the snap port to the corresponding offset
              in the snap area as a snap position.
        For the snap offsets in each axis, if there is at least one snap offset:
          Clamp the offsets to the min and max scroll offsets
          Ensure that the offsets are sorted and do not contain duplicated offsets

        * platform/cocoa/ScrollController.mm:
        (WebCore::ScrollController::updateScrollSnapState):

        Clear out the ScrollController's snap offsets and state along an axis when its ScrollableArea no longer has snap

        of checking if the list of scroll snap coordinates is empty for the absence of scroll positions, we instead

        - ScrollSnapAxisAlignType indicates which offsets along the x or y axes of the snap port and snap area should be
          used to compute the snap position emitted by a snap area.

        container, handling the properties `scroll-snap-type` and `scroll-padding` and StyleScrollSnapArea for child
        elements, handling the properties `scroll-snap-align` and `scroll-snap-margin`. The ScrollSnapType itself is
        composed of an axis value and a strictness, while a ScrollSnapAlign keeps track of the alignment modes in each
        axis. By default, these are initialized to {Both, None} and {None, None}, respectively. The rest of the logic is

        [GTK] GLXBadFBConfig error when creating an OpenGL context
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165200

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        glXCreateContextAttribsARB causes a GLXBadFBConfig X error when it's not able to provide the
        OpenGL version >= 3.2 we are requesting. Due to this, the app crashes instead of falling back to
        the legacy path.
        The patch modifies GLX context creation using a XErrorTrapper, so the first time a context is created
        we don't crash if OpenGL >= 3.2 is not available.
        If the gotten context is not valid, we fall back to whatever version glXCreateContextAttribsARB is
        able to provide.
        The legacy glXCreateContext is only used if the GLX_ARB_create_context extension is not available.

        IndexedDB 2.0: Prefetch cursor records in the server.

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        No new tests (Covered by existing LayoutTests and PerformanceTests).

        This patch implements the followng:
        1 - After a backing store cursor completes a fetch in the server, it will schedule the next fetch 
            even before the client requests one. It will do this up to a limited number of prefetches.
        2 - Once a client request to advance the cursor comes in, we'll work our way through prefetched
            records instead of reading anything from disk, which might then cause us to continue prefetch.
        3 - If any changes to the object store occur, it will throw away all previously fetched records
            (There's room for future improvement here)

        Changing text direction fires input events with null inputTypes and no data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166007
        <rdar://problem/29557205>

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Adds support for the "formatSetInlineTextDirection" input type, triggered when using the context menu on Mac in
        an editable area (for both plain and rich text cases) to change paragraph direction. To do this, we add cases
        for EditActionSetWritingDirection in inputTypeNameForEditingAction and inputEventDataForEditingStyleAndAction.

        When changing text direction for a plaintext editable element, we have logic in Editor::setBaseWritingDirection
        that sets the focused element's dir attribute to the requested value (ltr or rtl). We add similar hooks here to
        dispatch input events and handle preventing default.

        applies style with an additional `unicode-bidi` attribute, and appears to also be intentionally disabled for
        plaintext editable elements.

        [CSS Values] Make separate wrapper classes for the deprecated CSS Values OM
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165968

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch changes the CSS OM for values to use distinct wrapper
        classes instead of cloning the existing classes. By actually wrapping
        values instead of cloning, we are freed up to change our CSS value hierarchy
        however we'd like (such as changing to match the new CSS Values OM that
        is coming soon).

        All of the CSS Values wrapper classes are prefixed with "DeprecatedCSSOM"
        to reflect our desire (ultimately) to remove this API from our tree. We're
        the only ones that support it, and it's not used on the Web, but it is part
        of the WebKitLegacy API and might be used internally.

        IndexedDB: Refactor SQLiteIDBCursor to prepare for cursor prefetching.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        No new tests (Refactor, no behavior change).
        
        In preparation for cursor prefetching, we need to shift the cursor off of keeping "the current record"
        and onto keeping "a deque of fetched records", the first of which is "the current record".
        
        This patch does just that, but with no behavior change; The deque only ever holds 0 or 1 records.

        Add a setting to suppress keyboard input during provisional navigation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165830

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Added a setting that suppresses keyboard input during provisional navigation. When the
        setting is enabled, DOM propogation of keyboard input events (KeyboardEvents,
        CompositionEvents, InputEvents, and some TextEvents) is suppressed, and text insertion is
        disabled in the editor.

        Non-editing default event handling still occurs, for instance keyboard scrolling, access
        keys, and focus navigation.

        Subframes going into page cache don't need to resetScrollbars().
        <https://webkit.org/b/163750>
        <rdar://problem/29273020>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The main frame is the only frame that switches its FrameView when using the page cache,
        subframes just suspend their DOM and wait around to be either killed or restored.

        Thus there is no reason for subframes to reset their FrameView's scrollbars when going
        into page cache, since nothing affects them while cached, and their layout should end up
        identical when restoring.

        This was causing some flakiness with subframe scrollbars jumping between different sizes
        in when restoring from page cache in macOS/WK1. This change makes the behavior consistent
        in both WK1 and WK2, and removes the flakiness.

        When changing the layout viewport override, mark viewport-constrained objects as needing layout. If only the

        rects) that depends on the document location of fixed elements may be stale immediately after the layout
        viewport override changes and before layout occurs.

        CachedImageObserver can keep references for more than one CachedImage.

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

        The value of the word-spacing property is not applied on the inline-tree boxes (normal line layout)
        with kerning enabled. It causes hittest failures and selection/rendering glitches.
        We normally use the pre-computed 'WordMeasurements' values to figure out the run widths. However
        with kerning on, in some cases we need to re-measure a certain part of the text by calling RenderText::width().
        This function omits the word-spacing value for leading whitespace, so when this text fragment starts with a whitespace,
        (while it's not at the beginning of the run) we have to manually add the word-spacing value back.
        r146087 added this logic with the restriction of applying it only to whitespace-only runs.

        Move charCode / keyCode / which attributes from UIEvent to KeyboardEvent
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165904

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Move 'charCode' / 'keyCode' attributes from UIEvent to KeyboardEvent and add
        'which' to KeyboardEvent to match the specification:
        - https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-interface-KeyboardEvent

        We keep a 'which' attribute on UIEvent even though the specification does
        not say we should because Firefox and Chrome have 'which' on UIEvent still.

        Specification:
        - 'charCode' / 'keyCode' / 'which' on KeyboardEvent only

        Firefox:
        - 'charCode' / 'keyCode' on KeyboardEvent only
        - 'which' on UIEvent only

        Chrome:
        - 'charCode' / 'keyCode' / 'which' on KeyboardEvent
        - 'which' on UIEvent as well

        Old WebKit behavior:
        - 'charCode' / 'keyCode' / 'which' on UIEvent only

        New WebKit behavior:
        - 'charCode' / 'keyCode' / 'which' on KeyboardEvent
        - 'which' on UIEvent as well

        Our new behavior is identical to Chrome, much closer to the specification,
        and closer to Firefox as well.

        No new tests, updated / rebaselined existing tests.

        [Cocoa] Implement font-synthesis: small-caps

        [CSS Parser] Enable CSS Deferred Parsing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165869

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Enable CSS deferred parsing once again. It's now behind a pref,
        so it's easy to flip off and on.

        To address the memory regression that caused the previous rollout,
        the tokenizer is no longer retained. Instead the sheet text and escaped
        strings are retained by CSSDeferredParser, and then DeferredStyleProperties
        and DeferredStyleGroupRuleList make copies of the tokens from the original
        tokenization process. As the rules get parsed, these tokens get thrown
        away.

        This means that instead of the entire set of tokens staying in memory
        as long as even one unparsed rule remained, now only the tokens that
        still need parsing will remain alive.

        Unparsed rules will consume slightly more memory than parsed rules, but
        the more unparsed rules you have, the bigger the performance win as
        well, so this is a tradeoff. Given that the parsing speed is going up
        by anywhere from 25-40% on cold loads of pages (where all stylesheets
        have to parse), this seems worth it to me.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Added new tests in fast/css/deferred-parsing.

        This patch implements deferred parsing in CSS. By default, when parsing
        author stylesheets, the parser goes into a deferred mode where it leaves
        the declaration block of all style rules unparsed initially. Instead of
        creating and setting an ImmutableStyleProperties object on the StyleRule,
        the parser creates a DeferredStyleProperties object instead that is
        capable of calling into CSSDeferredParser to parse the properties and values
        only when the properties are finally asked for.

        In addition, this patch defers the parsing of the interior of @media,
        @supports, and @keyframes rules. @media blocks that are never matched will
        never parse any of the rules inside. @supports conditions for unsupported
        features will also not be parsed. For @keyframes, if the animation is never
        referenced/used, then the @keyframes child rules will never be parsed.

        This patch adds a new base class called StylePropertiesBase, and StyleProperties
        now derives from it. DeferredStyleProperties derives from this base. The members

        the CSSDeferredParser is referenced by all the rules that have yet to parse,
        it will stay alive until all rules in the stylesheet has been fully parsed.

        The parser receives CSSParserTokenRanges from DeferredStyleProperties or
        DeferredStyleGroupRuleList and feeds them to CSSParserImpl, which then
        is able to do the parsing as it would have occurred originally had the
        range not been deferred.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This is *attempt to fix* patch since I cannot reproduce the crash reported in this issue.
        One possible scenario of this crash is the following.

        1. There is pending deferred scripts, that is not fetched yet.
        2. Then, we start watching on the script. And stop document parser.
        3. The document parser is stopped/detached by calling finishJSTest in beforeload.
        4. At this critical timing, (2)'s script is fetched, and notifyFinished is called since it is watched.

        In this patch, we ignore the script execution if the document parser is stopped / detached.
        Previously, it goes into the wrong path. And it causes assertion failure.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Remove SVGColor and SVGPaint CSS values from the tree. The new parser
        already stopped making these values when parsing, so all that's left
        is to make sure computed style doesn't use these values either.

        We are the only browser engine to support these CSS values, they see no use
        on the Web, and they're already gone at the parsing level, so it's time
        to remove these interfaces from our tree.

        part of the fixpoint. This changes all WebCore visitChildren methods that do opaque
        roots into constraints.

        [WebIDL] Remove use of Dictionary in ApplePaySession
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165787

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        First take at generating the bindings for ApplePaySession and removing
        all use of Dictionary.
        
        - Removes all use of Dictionary!
        - Removes use of logging errors to the console with improved Exception messages.
        - Use ExceptionOr extensively to pass exception state.
        
        Still to do:
            - Reconcile / merge ApplePaySession::PaymentRequest with WebCore::PaymentRequest
              and all the sub-objects held within.
            - Remove PaymentRequestValidator entirely, merging validation into the validation
              we already do in ApplePaySession.cpp
            - Make ApplePayEvents use generated dictionary creation code.

        CSP: Teach the preload scanner about the 'nonce' attribute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161192
        <rdar://problem/28010354>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch was inspired by a similar Blink change:
        <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/dde5487f380cf774e4c0e96ba7f88ea68e723907>

        Preload external scripts and stylesheets whose HTML script and link elements have a nonce
        attribute that is listed in the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the page.

        Currently the preload scanner ignores the nonce attribute on HTML script and link elements.
        So, WebKit does not preload their associated subresources unless the value of the src
        attribute or href attribute is whitelisted in the CSP of the page for script and link
        elements, respectively. Instead the preload scanner should recognize the nonce attribute on
        script and link elements and query the CSP of the page with it. If the nonce attribute is
        whitelisted then the request should be preloaded.

        After this patch, all use of legacy WebCore::Dictionary is within custom bindings or

        Infinite recursion when viewport is set to the size of the content but the content overflows the viewport.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        In certain cases when the viewport is sized to accomodate the content and
        the content always overflows the viewport, we might end up in recursive FrameView::layout calls.
        This is specific to content with viewport units, because we always invalidate elements with vw/vh units on
        viewport size change. However if this viewport size change is in response to content size change (layout), 
        invalidating elements could trigger synchronous layout, while we are still inside this current layout.
        This is very similar to the m_setNeedsLayoutWasDeferred case and they should eventually be merged.
        It also means that we might be behind by one layout on elements with vw/vh units (fixed layout only though).

        Currently not testable.

        The CSS 'columns' property when set on the <body> element makes short columns
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164891

        Reviewed by Darin Adler and David Hyatt.

        Currently when the body has auto height, we use the height of the viewport as
        the available height for the columns defined on the body element.
        This is the desired behaviour for paginated content.
        However in case of a simple, non-paginated multicolumn context, we should let the columns grow beyond
        the viewport vertically. This is also what other browsers do.
        This patch sets the available height on columns (in non-paginated context) only if the logical height
        is defined (we are right before layout, so applying non-defined values does not make much sense anyway).
        The reason why it is only broken on the <body> is because it stretches to the viewport by
        default (see stretchesToViewport()) while other block renderers do not.

        The DOM should have an advancing wavefront opaque root barrier
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165712

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        No new tests because this was covered by crashing tests.
        
        Consider these two cases:
        
           Removal:
           1) DOM at start: D->X->Y
           2) Mark X, X->visitChildren, addOpaqueRoot(D)
           3) remove X
           4) Y thinks it's not reachable (its opaque root, X, is not in the set).
           
           Insertion:
           1) DOM at start: D, X->Y
           2) Mark X, X->visitChildren, addOpaqueRoot(X)
           3) insert X into D
           4) Y thinks it's not reachable (its opaque root, D, is not in the set).
        
        We can fix this with two barriers:
        
           Removal: add X (the removed child) to the opaque root set.
           Insertion: add D (the insertion point) to the opaque root set.
        
        Thanks Rysosuke for coming up with this idea!
        
        Both barriers advance the wavefront. We could consider retreating wavefront barriers in
        the future (where we cause visitChildren to be called again on wrappers that belonged to
        roots that got affected by insertion/removal) but those would probably require more
        bookkeeping.
        
        To make this barrier very fast, the WebCore caches the JSC VM's barrier state in
        its own global variable for very fast access. This variable will be false most of the
        time. It's false when there is no VM, so triggering the barrier won't cause the VM to be
        created. It's only true when GC is running, which is rare by design.
        
        To make that caching more sensible, I finally gave WebCore a central header for
        the common VM (CommonVM.h).

        Animation followed by transition doesn't always fire transitionend event

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.
        
        After r200047, a keyframe animation of an accelerated property followed by a
        transition didn't always fire a transitionend event.
        
        This happened if CompositeAnimation::timeToNextService() happend to be called
        when the transitions's timeToNextService() returned a positive value, but the
        keyframe animation still existed, but its timeToNextService() returned -1. In
        this case that -1 would clobber the positing minT.

        Fix by just continuing in each loop when the timeToNextService() returns -1.

        This code should probably be rewritten to use std::optional<double> rather than
        magic values.

        [CSS Parser] Remove the old CSS Parser
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165645

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Remove the old CSS parser code. In doing so, code that used documentless
        CSSParserContexts is now going through the new parser. This resulted in
        some additional changes. These include:

        (1) Canvas color parsing switched to new parser's code. This resulted in
        progressions on canvas tests.

        (2) Support for CSSNamespaceRule in the CSS OM, since the Inspector's
        creation of CSS OM wrappers made it necessary to add this in. The old parser
        did not create style rules for namespaces, but the new one (and other browsers)
        did.

        (3) <font face="X"> now uses the new parser's font-family parsing code. This
        change was made in createFontFaceValue in CSSValuePool.

        (4) FontFace now uses a new function on the new parser called
        parseFontFaceDescriptor. This function sets things up so that parsing occurs
        as though you are inside a @font-face. The old parser let you call parseValue
        to parse "properties", but descriptors need to be handled differently in the
        new parser.

        (5) Illegal CSS rules in mediaControlsApple/ios.css forced me to add a quirk
        to handle chained shadow DOM pseudo-elements. This should not be allowed, but
        for now it is.

        document.webkitFullscreenElement leaks elements inside a shadow tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158471

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Fixed the bug by calling the newly added ancestorElementInThisScope in webkitCurrentFullScreenElementForBindings
        and webkitFullscreenElementForBinding.

        The specification (https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-fullscreenelement) uses "the result of
        retargeting fullscreen element" and returns null if the result is not in the same tree as the context object.

        This is equivalent to the algorithm implemented by ancestorElementInThisScope. Observe that the retargeting
        algorithm (https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#retarget) finds the lowest common tree scope of the retargetee and
        the context object. There are two cases to consider.

        1. The context object's tree scope is the lowest common tree scope: In this case, an ancestor shadow host or
        the retargetee itself is in this tree scope. It's sufficient traverse every shadow host to find the one that
        resides in the same tree scope as the context object. This is precisely what ancestorElementInThisScope does.

        2. The context object's tree scope is not the lowest common tree scope: In this case, the context object is
        inside a shadow tree whose ancestor shadow host is in the lowest common tree scope. In this case, retargeting
        algorithm finds a node which is not in the same tree as the context object. Thus, the result is null.
        ancestorElementInThisScope traveres ancestor shadow hosts and returns null if no shadow host's tree scope
        matches that of the context object's tree scope. Thus, it would return null in this case as desired.

        Also renamed TreeScope::focusedElement to focusedElementInScope for clarity since Document which inherits
        from TreeScope also has a distinct member function named focusedElement called by TreeScope::focusedElement,
        and used ancestorElementInThisScope since it uses the same algorithm.

        An about:blank window inherits its security origin from its opener document. It should also

        [Modern Media Controls] Remaining time label first appears way to the left
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165637

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We would sometimes see the remaining time label be laid out in an incorrect position
        when a video would start playing. This happened because the time label was being committed
        from a previous value before, in the same frame, we would call the layout() function
        of MacOSInlineMediaControls. This would set the newly computed location for the
        remaining time label, but because we would reset the list of dirty properties after
        calling all layout functions, the new value set in MacOSInlineMediaControls.layout()
        would be disregarded and the wrong, committed value would persist until it was reset
        in a much later frame.

        We now correctly clear the list of dirty nodes before laying them out, giving all nodes
        a chance to become dirty again during layout, and updated again in the next frame.

        [css-grid] Pass Grid as argument to items' placement methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165250

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        In order to constify computeIntrinsicLogicalWidths() it is required to constify
        placeItemsOnGrid() first, which is the base method of the grid items' positioning logic. The
        first step is to constify all the methods invoked by the latter, which basically means to
        pass the Grid as argument to all of them instead of directly using the m_grid attribute from
        RenderGrid. As this is an intermediate step, a new const_cast<> was required in the
        intrinsic size computation. However it will be promptly removed after the const-ification of
        placeItemsOnGrid().

        After this, only the methods used by the track sizing algorithm will directly access
        m_grid. All those would get a reference to the Grid via GridSizingData, but that's a matter
        of a follow up patch.

        Apart from that, m_gridIsDirty was removed because it was always too confusing. It was
        replaced by Grid's m_needsItemsPlacement which is much more concise. The clearGrid() call
        was indeed only forcing a new placement of the grid items.

        No new tests as this is a refactoring.

        ASSERTION FAILED: m_items.isEmpty() in CustomElementReactionQueue destructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162029

        The bug was caused by Document::removedLastRef enqueuing disconnectedCallback during a tear down.
        Don't enqueue a disconnectedCallback while a document is getting torn down since that should not be
        observable to author scripts. The connected, adopted, and attributeChanged callbacks are immune from
        this problem since they don't happen during a document destruction.

        Note that this was also the case prior to this patch since the disconnectedCallback would have been
        added to the current CustomElementReactionQueue which will be destructed without invoking callbacks
        (or hit a release assertion added in r208785 and r209426 for now).

        Implement Strict Mixed Content Checking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165438
        <rdar://problem/26103867>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham and Andy Estes.

        Add support for the CSP directive block-all-mixed-content to enable strict mixed content checking
        as per <https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-mixed-content-20160802/#strict-checking> (2 August 2016).

        Currently WebKit only blocks blockable content as such content can contaminate the security origin
        that loaded it. Optionally-blockable content, including images, would be allowed to load as mixed
        content. When strict mixed content checking is enabled all mixed content is blocked. That is, both
        blockable and optionally-blockable content will be blocked. A web site can opt into strict mixed
        content checking by adding the directive block-all-mixed-content to their content security policy.

        When such as URL is used as a base URL with a relative path, in order to maintain compatibility with URL::parse we need to prepend
        a slash to the path.  For completeness I added tests with a relative path, a relative query, a relative fragment, and a relative empty string,

        [CSS Parser] Consolidate string/ident/url serialization functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165552

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Right now CSSParser has string, ident and url serialization functions
        called quoteCSStringIfNeeded (which actually serializes both strings and
        identifiers), as well as quoteCSSURLIfNeeded.

        CSSMarkup already has serialization functions that exist outside of the
        CSSParser and that handle serialization of strings, idents and URLs. This
        patch eliminates the CSSParser functions and consolidates all of the
        serialization to use CSSMarkup's functions.

        Note that we are not spec-compliant at all here, and so I had to amend
        the functions to support our non-spec-compliant serialization. The goal
        of this patch is consolidation and not to fix our broken serialization.

        Notable changes include parameterizing string serialization so that
        both single and double quotes are supported, since in the existing code
        we're sometimes spec-compliant (CSSSelectors) and sometimes not
        (CSSPrimitiveValue).

        We also overload CSS_STRING primitive value type and have it act as both
        a string and a custom identifier. This is lame, since the parser should
        have made two different types of objects instead, but since our parser
        doesn't do that yet, I added a serializeAsStringOrCustomIdent that
        preserves our old behavior of "quote the string only if needed." In this
        case what that really meant was "Try to guess that we were originally a
        custom ident and leave off quotes if so." This function will go away
        once we properly create CSSStringValues and CSSCustomIdentValues instead
        of turning the latter into strings.

        (GlobalNodeMap.nodeAttributesToObject):
        (GlobalNodeMap.prototype.descriptionHTMLForGUID):
        (GlobalNodeMap.prototype.descriptionHTMLForNode):

        The GlobalNodeMap keeps track of every node that has appeared in the DOM, assigning each node a globally unique
        identifier (GUID). This GUID is used when reconstructing the DOM, as well as unapplying or applying editing.

        (SelectionState):
        (SelectionState.prototype.isEqual):
        (SelectionState.prototype.applyToSelection):
        (SelectionState.fromSelection):
        (SelectionState.prototype.toObject):
        (SelectionState.fromObject):

        (DOMUpdate.prototype.detailsElement):
        (DOMUpdate.ofType):
        (DOMUpdate.fromRecords):

        A DOMUpdate is an abstract object representing a change in the DOM that may be applied and unapplied. These are
        also serializable as hashes, which may then be converted to JSON when generating editing history data.

        (ChildListUpdate):
        (ChildListUpdate.prototype.apply):
        (ChildListUpdate.prototype.unapply):
        (ChildListUpdate.prototype._nextSibling):

        (ChildListUpdate.prototype.toObject):
        (ChildListUpdate.prototype.detailsElement):
        (ChildListUpdate.fromObject):

        These three update types correspond to the three types of DOM mutations. These may appear as top-level updates
        if they are not captured during an input event, but for the majority of user-input-driven changes, they will be
        children of an input event.

        (CharacterDataUpdate):
        (CharacterDataUpdate.prototype.apply):
        (CharacterDataUpdate.prototype.unapply):
        (CharacterDataUpdate.prototype.detailsElement):
        (CharacterDataUpdate.prototype.toObject):
        (CharacterDataUpdate.fromObject):
        (AttributeUpdate):
        (AttributeUpdate.prototype.apply):
        (AttributeUpdate.prototype.unapply):

        (SelectionUpdate.prototype.apply):
        (SelectionUpdate.prototype.unapply):
        (SelectionUpdate.prototype.toObject):
        (SelectionUpdate.fromObject):
        (SelectionUpdate.prototype._rangeDescriptionHTML):
        (SelectionUpdate.prototype._anchorDescriptionHTML):
        (SelectionUpdate.prototype._focusDescriptionHTML):
        (SelectionUpdate.prototype.detailsElement):

        Represents a change in the Selection. While no changes to the DOM structure occur as a result of a
        SelectionUpdate, the information contained in these updates is used to determine where the selection should be
        when rewinding or playing back the editing history.

        (InputEventUpdate):
        (InputEventUpdate.prototype._obfuscatedData):
        (InputEventUpdate.prototype.apply):
        (InputEventUpdate.prototype.unapply):
        (InputEventUpdate.prototype.toObject):
        (InputEventUpdate.fromObject):
        (InputEventUpdate.prototype.detailsElement):

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        If a track associated with MSE is disabled after a SourceBuffer begins parsing a queued
        append operation, SourceBuffer can get into a state where it asks SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC
        if it is ready to accept data for that disabled track. This causes an ASSERT_NOT_REACHED in
        isReadyForMoreData().

        However, this seems to be a valid condition; we can safely just return "false" from
        isReadyForMoreSamples() (and also bail from notifyClientWhenReadyForMoreSamples()) when asked
        about a disabled track.

        early return after firing the beforeinput event if the default behavior was prevented, which caused us to

        Existing MediaDocuments got styling from the injected style
        sheet, which had rules for such documents. The modern media controls

        inline the style directly from MediaDocument.

        Make all objects in window.__proto__'s prototype chain immutable prototype exotic

        Firefox's behavior differ slightly in that Firefox will fail any attempted
        assignment their __proto__, while the immutable prototype exotic objects will
        only fail if the assignment is of a different value.  See
        https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-immutable-prototype-exotic-objects.

        Chrome differs in that assignment to window.__proto__ is also handled like an
        immutable prototype exotic object.  Instead we adhere to the current HTML spec
        that says that the assignment should fail unconditionally.  See
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-windowproxy-exotic-object and
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#windowproxy-setprototypeof.

        If the HTML spec is changed to make the WindowProxy and Location objects into
        immutable prototype exotic objects later, we can update to match the spec then.

        Improve the behavior of scroll-into-view when the target is inside position:fixed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165354

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.
        
        The existing RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() code paid no heed to whether the 
        target was inside position:fixed, resulting in unwanted scrolls.
        
        Fix this by plumbing through from the call sites a "insideFixed" flag which we get
        when we call localToAbsolute(), and use this flag to avoid scrolling at all if
        unzoomed.
        
        If zoomed and we're focussing something inside position:fixed, and if visual viewports
        are enabled, we can compute the visual viewport required to reveal the target rect,
        which gives us the ideal scroll position.
        
        Fix a bug on non-iOS platforms when zoomed, which is to scale the viewRect since
        frameView.visibleContentRect() gives an unscaled rect on those platforms.
        
        Not all callers of scrollRectToVisible() are fixed, but those that are not will get
        the current behavior.

        [Cocoa] REGRESSION(r205396): Intermediate CTRuns with initial advances get double counted when glyph origins are enabled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165084

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When glyph origins are not enabled, an intermediate CTRun's initial advance is simply added
        to the previous glyph's advance. However, when glyph origins are enabled, this shouldn't
        occur.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        The new parser clamped numeric values in both the slow and fast paths to the max
        and min float values. The old parser simply allowed the values to be inf, and then
        had std::isinf checks to reject.

        Blink rejects also even though it clamps, but I could not discern the mechanism by
        which they did so. Therefore I am changing the new parser to exactly match the old
        parser. Numeric values are no longer clamped, but instead are allowed to be inf, and
        isinf checks now exist in the new parser in the same places they do in the old parser.

        Reverting part of the code added in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165287 that triggered
        an assertion. We go back to removing previous media controls as we add new ones when the fullscreen
        status changes, and simply hide the controls during the animated transition using a CSS pseudo-class.
        This also fixes an issue where we wouldn't have removed the previous controls should we have entered
        fullscreen in a different way than clicking on the fullscreen button in the media controls.

        We restore testing coverage that was fixed due to this assertion.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165368

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Replace the in-place lowercasing that the parser does with new
        mechanisms. In-place lowercasing ruins serialization and doesn't
        work on CSS parsed from static strings. It also has the side effect
        of mutating strings passed in from JavaScript like for querySelectorAll.

        For class/id selectors, we now check if the string is lowercase or not.
        If it contains uppercase ASCII characters, then we allocate the RareData
        for the selector. RareData now has two fields instead of one for the value,
        a matching value (all lowercase in quirks mode), and a serializing value (the
        original string). Because this is done at the CSSSelector level, the old
        parser has been patched as well for these cases.

        In addition, in-place lowercasing was done for pseudo-elements, for
        media query features, and for attr(). In all of these cases we do
        lowercase converting by first checking if it's needed. Serialization will
        not retain the original string in these cases, so we may want to revisit
        these cases in the future and apply a solution similar to what we did for
        selectors.

        [CSS Parser] Remove line numbers from StyleRule.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165361

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        StyleRules have a concept of a source line that is eventually passed
        to the inspector. This was only ever used by normal rules, i.e., ones with
        selectors, and set to 0 for all other rules. This line was set to the line number
        at which the end of the selector text occurred.

        Because Inspector already computes the start and end range for the selector
        text, storing a source line on StyleRule ends up being redundant. This patch
        gets rid of the source line and uses the end line of the selector text
        instead.

        Improve the behavior of scroll-into-view when the target is inside position:fixed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165354

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.
        
        The existing RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() code paid no heed to whether the 
        target was inside position:fixed, resulting in unwanted scrolls.
        
        Fix this by plumbing through from the call sites a "insideFixed" flag which we get
        when we call localToAbsolute(), and use this flag to avoid scrolling at all if
        unzoomed.
        
        If zoomed and we're focussing something inside position:fixed, and if visual viewports
        are enabled, we can compute the visual viewport required to reveal the target rect,
        which gives us the ideal scroll position.
        
        Fix a bug on non-iOS platforms when zoomed, which is to scale the viewRect since
        frameView.visibleContentRect() gives an unscaled rect on those platforms.
        
        Not all callers of scrollRectToVisible() are fixed, but those that are not will get
        the current behavior.

        localToAbsolute() does incorrect conversion for elements inside position:fixed with zooming
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165244

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.
        
        RenderView::mapLocalToContainer() and RenderView::mapAbsoluteToLocalPoint() handle the coordinate
        mapping through the RenderView's transform (when zoomed), and apply the scroll offset for position:fixed
        elements.
        
        They did this in the wrong order; "local to absolute" applied the zoom scale, and then adjusted for the scroll position,
        and "absolute to local" applied the scroll position and then the transform.
        
        However that scroll position adjustment should be in unzoomed coordinates, since it's accounting for the
        layout adjustment that position:fixed receives (which actually occurs via the localToAbsolute() call
        in RenderLayer's accumulateOffsetTowardsAncestor()). "local to absolute" should therefore apply the scroll
        adjustment first before the transform, and "absolute to local" the reverse.
        
        In both visual viewport mode, and legacy drifty fixed mode FrameView::scrollPositionForFixedPosition()
        returns a scroll offset that is unaffected by zoom, which is correct and confirms this change.
        
        [Confusingly, ScrollView scroll positions _are_ affected by zoom, as the entire document gets bigger.]
        
        RenderGeometryMap::mapToContainer(), which is an optimization on top of RenderView::mapLocalToContainer(),
        gets a similar fix.

        Require preflight for non-standard CORS-safelisted request headers Accept, Accept-Language, and Content-Language
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165178
        <rdar://problem/18792250>

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        Fetch currently only restricts the header Content-Type for simple requests:
        https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header

        This means simple CORS requests can send unexpected characters in Accept, 
        Accept-Language, and Content-Language header values.

        RFC 7231 implies restrictions on these header values:
        - Accept https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2
        - Accept-Language https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5
        - Content-Language https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.3.2

        As per discussions in the W3C WebAppSec group we should try to restrict 
        these header values to help protect servers that do not expect simple CORS 
        requests.

        Non-standard, safelisted header values should trigger a preflight and require
        the headers to be whitelisted in the response's Access-Control-Allow-Headers.
        For Fetch in no-cors mode this change means non-standard header values are not
        allowed to be set.

        In a nested column context, do not process a spanner if it belongs to an inner column.

        While populating a flow, we search for possible spanners and construct multicolumnsets accordingly.
        However due to the top-down nature of populating flows, a descendant spanner could belong to an inner
        flow which hasn't been populated yet.
        This patch checks if a potential spanner has an ancestor (which is also a descendant
        of the flow that we are populating -> nested) that will eventually create a flow context.

        [Modern Media Controls] Show and populate the tracks panel
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165284

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We added a TracksPanel in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165239 which allows to
        show a list of media tracks and text tracks to choose from. We now show this panel when
        clicking on the tracks button in the controls bar and populate its content with the
        list of audio and text tracks for the media element. As an item is picked from the tracks
        panel, we toggle the represented track's enabled state and dismiss the panel.

        We also pick up the text track container display mostly unchanged from current media controls.

        [Modern Media Controls] Provide a UI object to show a list of tracks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165239

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We add a new TracksPanel object which we will be using to display a list of
        audio and text tracks. The tracks panel can be shown by calling showTracksPanel()
        on a MacOSMediaControls object and will be dismissed by hitting the Escape key
        or mousing down outside of the panel's bounds. While the tracks panel is up,
        arrows can be used to focus individual tracks which can be activated by either
        pressing the Space bar or Enter key.

        Activating a track will briefly animate its background to indicate selection and
        dismissing the tracks panel is also animated with a quick fade-out animation.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch adds a mechanism to mark points of interests where we might
        want to do performance-related logging:

            class PerformanceLogging {
                enum PointOfInterest {
                    MainFrameLoadStarted,

                void didReachPointOfInterest(PointOfInterest)
            }

        You get to this object via MainFrame::performanceLogging().

        We respond to these callbacks by logging some basic data about memory usage
        to the PerformanceLogging channel.

        More PointOfInterest values will be added soon.

        [css-grid] Move more attributes from RenderGrid to the new Grid class
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165094

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Moved more attributes from RenderGrid to Grid as they are not really part of the state of
        the RenderGrid object. In particular m_autoRepeat{Columns|Rows},
        m_autoRepeatEmpty{Columns|Rows} and m_orderIterator. All of them are now private attributes
        of the Grid class so clients should use the getters/setters provided by this patch.

        This change allows to definitely remove the grid{Column|Row}Count() methods from
        RenderGrid. These two became Grid::numTracks() which returns the number of tracks in the
        data structure used to represent the grid (currently a matrix). Contrary to that,
        RenderGrid::numTracks() returns the actual size of the grid.

        No new tests as this is a refactoring.

        [WebIDL] Add support for more missing / exotic IDLTypes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165156

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        - Adds JSDOMConvert support for WebIDL's 'callback interface' and 'callback function'.
        - Adds JSDOMConvert support for WebIDL extensions for SerializedScriptValue, Dictionary, 
          EventListener and XPathNSResolver (moving much of their special casing out of perl and
          into JSDOMConvert).

        * DerivedSources.make:
        Adds $(WebCore)/testing to the list of available IDL directories to keep internals
        compiling.

        * Modules/webaudio/WaveShaperNode.h:
        Update to take curve by reference.

        * bindings/generic/IDLTypes.h:

        IndexedDB 2.0: Cache and reuse SQLiteStatements in the SQLite backend.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164974

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        No new tests (No behavior change other than being faster).

        Instead of building new SQLiteStatements from scratch each time they're needed and then
        finalizing them after they're used for a single operation, we cache them.

        For tests that do puts and/or gets in tight loops, this shows up as a 5%-20% speedup on profiles.

        Some animated image do not animate after reseting their animations

        Streamline and speed up tokenizer and segmented string classes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165003

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Profiling Speedometer on my iMac showed the tokenizer as one of the
        hottest functions. This patch streamlines the segmented string class,
        removing various unused features, and also improves some other functions
        seen on the Speedometer profile. On my iMac I measured a speedup of
        about 3%. Changes include:

        - Removed m_pushedChar1, m_pushedChar2, and m_empty data members from the
          SegmentedString class and all the code that used to handle them.

        - Simplified the SegmentedString advance functions so they are small
          enough to get inlined in the HTML tokenizer.

        - Updated callers to call the simpler SegmentedString advance functions
          that don't handle newlines in as many cases as possible.

        - Cut down on allocations of SegmentedString and made code move the
          segmented string and the strings that are moved into it rather than
          copying them whenever possible.

        - Simplified segmented string functions, removing some branches, mostly
          from the non-fast paths.

        - Removed small unused functions and small functions used in only one
          or two places, made more functions private and renamed for clarity.

        * bindings/js/JSHTMLDocumentCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::documentWrite): Moved a little more of the common code in here
        from the two functions belwo. Removed obsolete comment saying this was not
        following the DOM specification because it is. Removed unneeded special
        cases for 1 argument and no arguments. Take a reference instead of a pointer.
        (WebCore::JSHTMLDocument::write): Updated for above.
        (WebCore::JSHTMLDocument::writeln): Ditto.

        * css/parser/CSSTokenizer.cpp: Added now-needed include.
        * css/parser/CSSTokenizer.h: Removed unneeded include.

        * css/parser/CSSTokenizerInputStream.h: Added definition of kEndOfFileMarker
        here; this is now separate from the use in the HTMLParser. In the long run,
        unclear to me whether it is really needed in either.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::prepareToWrite): Added. Helper function used by the three
        different variants of write. Using this may prevent us from having to construct
        a SegmentedString just to append one string after future refactoring.
        (WebCore::Document::write): Updated to take an rvalue reference and move the
        value through.
        (WebCore::Document::writeln): Use a single write call instead of two.

        * dom/Document.h: Changed write to take an rvalue reference to SegmentedString
        rather than a const reference.

        * dom/DocumentParser.h: Changed insert to take an rvalue reference to
        SegmentedString. In the future, should probably overload to take a single
        string since that is the normal case.

        * dom/RawDataDocumentParser.h: Updated for change to DocumentParser.

        * html/FTPDirectoryDocument.cpp:
        (WebCore::FTPDirectoryDocumentParser::append): Refactored a bit, just enough
        so that we don't need an assignment operator for SegmentedString that can
        copy a String.

        * html/parser/HTMLDocumentParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLDocumentParser::insert): Updated to take an rvalue reference,
        and move the value through.
        * html/parser/HTMLDocumentParser.h: Updated for the above.

        * html/parser/HTMLEntityParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLEntityParser::consumeNamedEntity): Updated for name changes.
        Changed the twao calls to advance here to call advancePastNonNewline; no
        change in behavior, but asserts what the code was assuming before, that the
        character was not a newline.

        * html/parser/HTMLInputStream.h:
        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::appendToEnd): Updated to take an rvalue reference,
        and move the value through.
        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::insertAtCurrentInsertionPoint): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::markEndOfFile): Removed the code to construct a
        SegmentedString, overkill since we can just append an individual string.
        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::splitInto): Rewrote the move idiom here to actually
        use move, which will reduce reference count churn and other unneeded work.

        * html/parser/HTMLMetaCharsetParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLMetaCharsetParser::checkForMetaCharset): Removed unneeded
        construction of a SegmentedString, just to append a string.

        * html/parser/HTMLSourceTracker.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLSourceTracker::HTMLSourceTracker): Moved to the class definition.
        (WebCore::HTMLSourceTracker::source): Updated for function name change.
        * html/parser/HTMLSourceTracker.h: Updated for above.

        * html/parser/HTMLTokenizer.cpp: Added now-needed include.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::emitAndResumeInDataState): Use advancePastNonNewline,
        since this function is never called in response to a newline character.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::commitToPartialEndTag): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::commitToCompleteEndTag): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::processToken): Use ADVANCE_PAST_NON_NEWLINE_TO macro
        instead of ADVANCE_TO in cases where the character we are advancing past is
        known not to be a newline, so we can use the more efficient advance function
        that doesn't check for the newline character.

        * html/parser/InputStreamPreprocessor.h: Moved kEndOfFileMarker to
        SegmentedString.h; not sure that's a good place for it either. In the long run,
        unclear to me whether this is really needed.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::peek): Added UNLIKELY for the empty check.
        Added LIKELY for the not-special character check.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::advance): Updated for the new name of the
        advanceAndUpdateLineNumber function.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::advancePastNonNewline): Added. More
        efficient than advance for cases where the last characer is known not to be
        a newline character.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::skipNextNewLine): Deleted. Was unused.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::reset): Deleted. Was unused except in the
        constructor; added initial values for the data members to replace.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::processNextInputCharacter): Removed long
        FIXME comment that didn't really need to be here. Reorganized a bit.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::isAtEndOfFile): Renamed and made static.

        * html/track/BufferedLineReader.cpp:
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::nextLine): Updated to not use the poorly named
        scanCharacter function to advance past a newline. Also renamed from getLine
        and changed to return Optional<String> instead of using a boolean to indicate
        failure and an out argument.

        * html/track/BufferedLineReader.h:
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::BufferedLineReader): Use the default, putting
        initial values on each data member below.
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::append): Updated to take an rvalue reference,
        and move the value through.
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::scanCharacter): Deleted. Was poorly named,
        and easy to replace with two lines of code at its two call sites.
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::reset): Rewrote to correctly clear all the
        data members of the class, not just the segmented string.

        * html/track/InbandGenericTextTrack.cpp:
        (WebCore::InbandGenericTextTrack::parseWebVTTFileHeader): Updated to take
        an rvalue reference and move the value through.
        * html/track/InbandGenericTextTrack.h: Updated for the above.

        * html/track/InbandTextTrack.h: Updated since parseWebVTTFileHeader now
        takes an rvalue reference.

        * html/track/WebVTTParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::parseFileHeader): Updated to take an rvalue reference
        and move the value through.
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::parseBytes): Updated to pass ownership of the string
        in to the line reader append function.
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::parseCueData): Use auto and WTFMove for WebVTTCueData.
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::flush): More of the same.
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::parse): Changed to use nextLine instead of getLine.
        * html/track/WebVTTParser.h: Updated for the above.

        * html/track/WebVTTTokenizer.cpp:
        (WebCore::advanceAndEmitToken): Use advanceAndUpdateLineNumber by its new
        name, just advance. No change in behavior.
        (WebCore::WebVTTTokenizer::WebVTTTokenizer): Pass a String, not a
        SegmentedString, to add the end of file marker.

        * platform/graphics/InbandTextTrackPrivateClient.h: Updated since
        parseWebVTTFileHeader takes an rvalue reference.

        * platform/text/SegmentedString.cpp:
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::appendTo): Moved here from the header.
        The only caller is SegmentedString::toString, inside this file.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::SegmentedString): Deleted the copy constructor.
        No longer needed.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::operator=): Defined a move assignment operator
        rather than an ordinary assignment operator, since that's what the call
        sites really need.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::length): Simplified since we no longer need to
        support pushed characters.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::setExcludeLineNumbers): Simplified, since we
        can just iterate m_otherSubstrings without an extra check. Also changed to
        write directly to the data member of Substring instead of using a function.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::updateAdvanceFunctionPointersForEmptyString):
        Added. Used when we run out of characters.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::clear): Removed code to clear now-deleted members.
        Updated for changes to other member names.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::appendSubstring): Renamed from just append to
        avoid ambiguity with the public append function. Changed to take an rvalue
        reference, and move in, and added code to set m_currentCharacter properly,
        so the caller doesn't have to deal with that.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::close): Updated to use m_isClosed by its new name.
        Also removed unneeded comment about assertion that fires when trying to close
        an already closed string.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::append): Added overloads for rvalue references of
        both entire SegmentedString objects and of String. Streamlined to just call
        appendSubstring and append to the deque.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::pushBack): Tightened up since we don't allow empty
        strings and changed to take just a string, not an entire segmented string.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceSubstring): Moved logic into the
        advancePastSingleCharacterSubstringWithoutUpdatingLineNumber function.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::toString): Simplified now that we don't need to
        support pushed characters.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastNonNewlines): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advance8): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceWithoutUpdatingLineNumber16): Renamed from
        advance16. Simplified now that there are no pushed characters. Also changed to
        access data members of m_currentSubstring directly instead of calling a function.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceAndUpdateLineNumber8): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceAndUpdateLineNumber16): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastSingleCharacterSubstringWithoutUpdatingLineNumber):
        Renamed from advanceSlowCase. Removed uneeded logic to handle pushed characters.
        Moved code in here from advanceSubstring.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastSingleCharacterSubstring): Renamed from
        advanceAndUpdateLineNumberSlowCase. Simplified by calling the function above.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceEmpty): Broke assertion up into two.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::updateSlowCaseFunctionPointers): Updated for name changes.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastSlowCase): Changed name and meaning of
        boolean argument. Rewrote to use the String class less; it's now used only when
        we fail to match after the first character rather than being used for the actual
        comparison with the literal.

        * platform/text/SegmentedString.h: Moved all non-trivial function bodies out of
        the class definition to make things easier to read. Moved the SegmentedSubstring
        class inside the SegmentedString class, making it a private struct named Substring.
        Removed the m_ prefix from data members of the struct, removed many functions from
        the struct and made its union be anonymous instead of naming it m_data. Removed
        unneeded StringBuilder.h include.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::isEmpty): Changed to use the length of the substring
        instead of a separate boolean. We never create an empty substring, nor leave one
        in place as the current substring unless the entire segmented string is empty.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePast): Updated to use the new member function
        template instead of a non-template member function. The new member function is
        entirely rewritten and does the matching directly rather than allocating a string
        just to do prefix matching.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastLettersIgnoringASCIICase): Renamed to make
        it clear that the literal must be all non-letters or lowercase letters as with
        the other "letters ignoring ASCII case" functions. The three call sites all fit
        the bill. Implement by calling the new function template.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::currentCharacter): Renamed from currentChar.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::Substring): Use an rvalue reference and
        move the string in.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::currentCharacter): Simplified since this
        is never used on an empty substring.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::incrementAndGetCurrentCharacter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::SegmentedString): Overload to take an rvalue reference.
        Simplified since there are now fewer data members.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceWithoutUpdatingLineNumber): Renamed from
        advance, since this is only safe to use if there is some reason it is OK to skip
        updating the line number.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advance): Renamed from advanceAndUpdateLineNumber,
        since doing that is the normal desired behavior and not worth mentioning in the
        public function name.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastNewline): Renamed from
        advancePastNewlineAndUpdateLineNumber.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::numberOfCharactersConsumed): Greatly simplified since
        pushed characters are no longer supported.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::characterMismatch): Added. Used by advancePast.

        * xml/parser/CharacterReferenceParserInlines.h:
        (WebCore::unconsumeCharacters): Use toString rather than toStringPreserveCapacity
        because the SegmentedString is going to take ownership of the string.
        (WebCore::consumeCharacterReference): Updated to use the pushBack that takes just
        a String, not a SegmentedString. Also use advancePastNonNewline.

        * xml/parser/MarkupTokenizerInlines.h: Added ADVANCE_PAST_NON_NEWLINE_TO.

        * xml/parser/XMLDocumentParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::XMLDocumentParser::insert): Updated since this takes an rvalue reference.
        (WebCore::XMLDocumentParser::append): Removed unnecessary code to create a
        SegmentedString.
        * xml/parser/XMLDocumentParser.h: Updated for above. Also fixed indentation
        and initialized most data members.
        * xml/parser/XMLDocumentParserLibxml2.cpp:
        (WebCore::XMLDocumentParser::XMLDocumentParser): Moved most data member
        initialization into the class definition.
        (WebCore::XMLDocumentParser::resumeParsing): Removed code that copied a
        segmented string, but converted the whole thing into a string before using it.
        Now we convert to a string right away.

        Instead of building new SQLiteStatements from scratch each time they're needed and then
        finalizing them after used for a single operation, cache them.

        For tests that do puts and/or gets in tight loops, this shows up as a 5%-20% speedup on profiles.

           https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#SubtleCrypto-method-sign.
           It also refers to the latest Editor's Draft to a certain degree:
           https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html#SubtleCrypto-method-sign.
        2. It implements sign operations of the following algorithms: HMAC, and
           RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5.
        3. It also replaces promise.copyRef() with WTFMove(promise) for all the
           capture lists of exception callbacks in promise functions.

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        We were ignoring non user-triggered activations of anchors that have a
        download attribute which is stricter than Chrome and Firefox and breaks
        downloads on move.simple.com. This patch relaxes our policy to allow
        simulated clicks on such links, similarly to other browsers.

        Web authors can anyway already trigger downloads using script by setting
        window.location to a specific URL and serving to right HTTP headers to
        trigger a download.

        Note that our previous behavior matches the current version of the
        specification so I also filed a bug against the HTML specification to
        see if we can get it changed to match the behavior of browsers:

        IndexedDB 2.0: The client's transaction operation queue should flush as much to the server as possible.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164932

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        No new tests (No new test necessary, covered extensively by all existing tests).

        Profiles showed that on tests with lots of rapid IDBRequests in a row, both the main thread and database 
        threads were largely idle.

        The explanation was simple. Currently the client IDBTransaction queues up operations and only vends them out 
        to the server 1 at a time, waiting for the previous operation to complete.

        While some operations do need to wait for the server to reply, by making the change to send most operations 
        (all operations with an associated IDBRequest) to the server without waiting we get rid of most of the idleness.

        It is possible we can find a few other types of operations to send without waiting, but we haven't yet seen any
        test case where they would show up on profiles.

        Sending more than one operation at a time was actually a very small part of this change.
        As many "edge case" regression tests revealed, we also needed to start having IDBTransaction track all of their
        "in progress" operations such that they could be aborted on the client side in exceptional circumstances.

        Scroll snapping on Mac should use AppKit animations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147261
        <rdar://problem/29395293>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Refactors the scroll snapping animation logic to support arbitrary scrolling momentum calculators and
        introduces ScrollingMomentumCalculatorMac, which wraps AppKit's _NSScrollingMomentumCalculator. On macOS El
        Capitan and later, we use the platform scrolling momentum calculator and for all other cases, we fall back to
        the preexissting platform-invariant momentum calculator.

        Previously, the scroll snapping animation logic was shared between the ScrollSnapAnimatorState and
        ScrollController -- namely, the ScrollController would update various parameters of the ScrollSnapAnimatorState
        and then tell it to compute animation-specific constants and coefficients. After this patch, ScrollController
        will no longer directly set the ScrollSnapAnimatorState's member variables. Instead, it will tell the animator
        state to transition to a new ScrollSnapState with the necessary parameters, and the ScrollSnapAnimatorState is
        responsible for modifying itself accordingly. Furthermore, logic pertaining to computing animated scroll offsets
        is now split out into a new ScrollingMomentumCalculator, which may have different platform-dependent
        implementations. The correct calculator is initialized via ScrollingMomentumCalculator::create, which currently
        returns a ScrollingMomentumCalculatorMac on El Capitan and later, and a BasicScrollingMomentumCalculator
        otherwise.

        The new abstracted ScrollingMomentumCalculator is initialized with various parameters describing the scrolled
        content and viewport, as well as the initial and target scrolling offsets. The momentum calculator is then able
        to compute the animated scroll offset at any given elapsed time, as well as the total duration of the snapping
        animation. The ScrollController's scroll snap timer uses this information (via the ScrollSnapAnimatorState) to
        animate its client's scroll offset during a snap or glide.

        Also reenables 8 failing and/or flaky scroll snapping tests and adds a new layout test. This patch addresses
        two causes for failures and flakiness in these scroll snapping tests:

        1.  When starting or stopping the scroll snap animation timer, we call deferTestsForReason and
            removeTestDeferralForReason, respectively. These were actually noops for the first simulated scroll gesture
            on each of the failing mainframe scrolling tests due to m_expectsWheelEventTestTrigger being false. This
            member variable is updated when AsyncScrollingCoordinator::frameViewLayoutUpdated is invoked, wherein we
            call ScrollingStateFrameScrollingNode::setExpectsWheelEventTestTrigger(true) when the test has started
            monitoring wheel events. However, if this does not happen before scrolling begins in the test (which is the
            case here), then the mainframe scrolling node will not expect a wheel event test trigger even though
            eventSender.monitorWheelEvents() has been called. To fix this, we simply make the Page trigger a layout of
            the main FrameView when first ensuring the wheel event test trigger on the Page.

        2.  The second reason for flakiness affects both overflow and mainframe scrolling. Previously, due to the way
            we would wait for multiple momentum scroll events before starting to glide, we would end up starting the
            scroll snap timer for a snapping animation, stopping it, and then starting it again for the glide animation.
            Thus, if the wheel event test trigger's timer fires right after the scroll snap timer stops and before it
            starts again due to a glide animation, it will erroneously think that scroll snapping is complete, even
            though it's only just about to begin! Now that we know scrolling velocity when we receive the initial
            "momentum begin", we now directly transition the scroll snap state from a snapping state to a gliding state
            and no longer stop and start the timer during this transition, which means that the test trigger will be
            deferred for at least the entire duration of the scroll snapping animation (starting right after the first
            "drag end" wheel event).

        The problem is that slot (display:contents) always triggers full render tree rebuild when something

        [GTK] Crash in WebCore::PlatformDisplayX11::supportsXComposite when running under Wayland
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164917

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        WebKitGTK+ appplications are expected to call gtk_init(), because WebKitGTK+, like GTK+ itself, requires a
        display to work. We currently fallback to create a X11 display when X11 is enabled in cases where GTK+ doesn't
        have a default display (gtk_init() wasn't called or failed). That's why we end up creating an X11 display under
        Wayland when both Wayland and X11 option are enabled. The code assumes X11 display creation will always work if
        X11 is enabled, but that's not true now that we support also Wayland at runtime. So, we should try to get a
        native display before creating the PlatformDisplay. Rendering will not work in any case when gtk_init() is not
        called, but in most of the cases those applications are not actually going to render anything, so this way at
        least we will not crash.

        Streamline and speed up tokenizer and segmented string classes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165003

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Profiling Speedometer on my iMac showed the tokenizer as one of the
        hottest functions. This patch streamlines the segmented string class,
        removing various unused features, and also improves some other functions
        seen on the Speedometer profile. On my iMac I measured a speedup of
        about 3%. Changes include:

        - Removed m_pushedChar1, m_pushedChar2, and m_empty data members from the
          SegmentedString class and all the code that used to handle them.

        - Simplified the SegmentedString advance functions so they are small
          enough to get inlined in the HTML tokenizer.

        - Updated callers to call the simpler SegmentedString advance functions
          that don't handle newlines in as many cases as possible.

        - Cut down on allocations of SegmentedString and made code move the
          segmented string and the strings that are moved into it rather than
          copying them whenever possible.

        - Simplified segmented string functions, removing some branches, mostly
          from the non-fast paths.

        - Removed small unused functions and small functions used in only one
          or two places, made more functions private and renamed for clarity.

        * bindings/js/JSHTMLDocumentCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::documentWrite): Moved a little more of the common code in here
        from the two functions belwo. Removed obsolete comment saying this was not
        following the DOM specification because it is. Removed unneeded special
        cases for 1 argument and no arguments. Take a reference instead of a pointer.
        (WebCore::JSHTMLDocument::write): Updated for above.

        * css/parser/CSSTokenizer.h: Removed unneeded include.

        * css/parser/CSSTokenizerInputStream.h: Added definition of kEndOfFileMarker
        here; this is now separate from the use in the HTMLParser. In the long run,
        unclear to me whether it is really needed in either.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::prepareToWrite): Added. Helper function used by the three
        different variants of write. Using this may prevent us from having to construct
        a SegmentedString just to append one string after future refactoring.
        (WebCore::Document::write): Updated to take an rvalue reference and move the
        value through.
        (WebCore::Document::writeln): Use a single write call instead of two.

        * dom/Document.h: Changed write to take an rvalue reference to SegmentedString
        rather than a const reference.

        * dom/DocumentParser.h: Changed insert to take an rvalue reference to
        SegmentedString. In the future, should probably overload to take a single

        (WebCore::HTMLDocumentParser::insert): Updated to take an rvalue reference,
        and move the value through.

        * html/parser/HTMLEntityParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLEntityParser::consumeNamedEntity): Updated for name changes.

        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::markEndOfFile): Removed the code to construct a

        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::splitInto): Rewrote the move idiom here to actually
        use move, which will reduce reference count churn and other unneeded work.

        * html/parser/HTMLMetaCharsetParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLMetaCharsetParser::checkForMetaCharset): Removed unneeded
        construction of a SegmentedString, just to append a string.

        * html/parser/HTMLSourceTracker.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLSourceTracker::HTMLSourceTracker): Moved to the class definition.
        (WebCore::HTMLSourceTracker::source): Updated for function name change.
        * html/parser/HTMLSourceTracker.h: Updated for above.

        * html/parser/HTMLTokenizer.cpp: Added now-needed include.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::emitAndResumeInDataState): Use advancePastNonNewline,
        since this function is never called in response to a newline character.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::commitToPartialEndTag): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::commitToCompleteEndTag): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLTokenizer::processToken): Use ADVANCE_PAST_NON_NEWLINE_TO macro

        known not to be a newline, so we can use the more efficient advance function
        that doesn't check for the newline character.

        * html/parser/InputStreamPreprocessor.h: Moved kEndOfFileMarker to
        SegmentedString.h; not sure that's a good place for it either. In the long run,
        unclear to me whether this is really needed.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::peek): Added UNLIKELY for the empty check.
        Added LIKELY for the not-special character check.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::advance): Updated for the new name of the
        advanceAndUpdateLineNumber function.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::advancePastNonNewline): Added. More
        efficient than advance for cases where the last characer is known not to be
        a newline character.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::skipNextNewLine): Deleted. Was unused.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::reset): Deleted. Was unused except in the
        constructor; added initial values for the data members to replace.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::processNextInputCharacter): Removed long
        FIXME comment that didn't really need to be here. Reorganized a bit.
        (WebCore::InputStreamPreprocessor::isAtEndOfFile): Renamed and made static.

        * html/track/BufferedLineReader.cpp:
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::nextLine): Updated to not use the poorly named
        scanCharacter function to advance past a newline. Also renamed from getLine
        and changed to return Optional<String> instead of using a boolean to indicate
        failure and an out argument.

        * html/track/BufferedLineReader.h:
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::BufferedLineReader): Use the default, putting
        initial values on each data member below.
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::append): Updated to take an rvalue reference,
        and move the value through.
        (WebCore::BufferedLineReader::scanCharacter): Deleted. Was poorly named,
        and easy to replace with two lines of code at its two call sites.

        * html/track/InbandGenericTextTrack.h: Updated for the above.

        * html/track/InbandTextTrack.h: Updated since parseWebVTTFileHeader now
        takes an rvalue reference.

        * html/track/WebVTTParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::parseFileHeader): Updated to take an rvalue reference

        in to the line reader append function.
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::parseCueData): Use auto and WTFMove for WebVTTCueData.
        (WebCore::WebVTTParser::flush): More of the same.

        * html/track/WebVTTParser.h: Updated for the above.

        * html/track/WebVTTTokenizer.cpp:
        (WebCore::advanceAndEmitToken): Use advanceAndUpdateLineNumber by its new

        (WebCore::WebVTTTokenizer::WebVTTTokenizer): Pass a String, not a
        SegmentedString, to add the end of file marker.

        * platform/graphics/InbandTextTrackPrivateClient.h: Updated since
        parseWebVTTFileHeader takes an rvalue reference.

        * platform/text/SegmentedString.cpp:
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::appendTo): Moved here from the header.
        The only caller is SegmentedString::toString, inside this file.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::SegmentedString): Deleted the copy constructor.
        No longer needed.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::operator=): Defined a move assignment operator
        rather than an ordinary assignment operator, since that's what the call
        sites really need.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::length): Simplified since we no longer need to
        support pushed characters.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::setExcludeLineNumbers): Simplified, since we
        can just iterate m_otherSubstrings without an extra check. Also changed to
        write directly to the data member of Substring instead of using a function.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::updateAdvanceFunctionPointersForEmptyString):
        Added. Used when we run out of characters.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::clear): Removed code to clear now-deleted members.
        Updated for changes to other member names.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::appendSubstring): Renamed from just append to
        avoid ambiguity with the public append function. Changed to take an rvalue
        reference, and move in, and added code to set m_currentCharacter properly,
        so the caller doesn't have to deal with that.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::close): Updated to use m_isClosed by its new name.
        Also removed unneeded comment about assertion that fires when trying to close
        an already closed string.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::append): Added overloads for rvalue references of
        both entire SegmentedString objects and of String. Streamlined to just call
        appendSubstring and append to the deque.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::pushBack): Tightened up since we don't allow empty
        strings and changed to take just a string, not an entire segmented string.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceSubstring): Moved logic into the
        advancePastSingleCharacterSubstringWithoutUpdatingLineNumber function.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::toString): Simplified now that we don't need to
        support pushed characters.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastNonNewlines): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advance8): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceWithoutUpdatingLineNumber16): Renamed from
        advance16. Simplified now that there are no pushed characters. Also changed to
        access data members of m_currentSubstring directly instead of calling a function.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceAndUpdateLineNumber8): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceAndUpdateLineNumber16): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastSingleCharacterSubstringWithoutUpdatingLineNumber):
        Renamed from advanceSlowCase. Removed uneeded logic to handle pushed characters.
        Moved code in here from advanceSubstring.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastSingleCharacterSubstring): Renamed from
        advanceAndUpdateLineNumberSlowCase. Simplified by calling the function above.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceEmpty): Broke assertion up into two.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::updateSlowCaseFunctionPointers): Updated for name changes.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastSlowCase): Changed name and meaning of
        boolean argument. Rewrote to use the String class less; it's now used only when
        we fail to match after the first character rather than being used for the actual
        comparison with the literal.

        * platform/text/SegmentedString.h: Moved all non-trivial function bodies out of
        the class definition to make things easier to read. Moved the SegmentedSubstring
        class inside the SegmentedString class, making it a private struct named Substring.
        Removed the m_ prefix from data members of the struct, removed many functions from
        the struct and made its union be anonymous instead of naming it m_data. Removed
        unneeded StringBuilder.h include.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::isEmpty): Changed to use the length of the substring
        instead of a separate boolean. We never create an empty substring, nor leave one
        in place as the current substring unless the entire segmented string is empty.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePast): Updated to use the new member function
        template instead of a non-template member function. The new member function is
        entirely rewritten and does the matching directly rather than allocating a string
        just to do prefix matching.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastLettersIgnoringASCIICase): Renamed to make
        it clear that the literal must be all non-letters or lowercase letters as with
        the other "letters ignoring ASCII case" functions. The three call sites all fit
        the bill. Implement by calling the new function template.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::currentCharacter): Renamed from currentChar.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::Substring): Use an rvalue reference and
        move the string in.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::currentCharacter): Simplified since this
        is never used on an empty substring.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::Substring::incrementAndGetCurrentCharacter): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::SegmentedString): Overload to take an rvalue reference.
        Simplified since there are now fewer data members.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advanceWithoutUpdatingLineNumber): Renamed from
        advance, since this is only safe to use if there is some reason it is OK to skip
        updating the line number.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advance): Renamed from advanceAndUpdateLineNumber,
        since doing that is the normal desired behavior and not worth mentioning in the
        public function name.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::advancePastNewline): Renamed from
        advancePastNewlineAndUpdateLineNumber.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::numberOfCharactersConsumed): Greatly simplified since
        pushed characters are no longer supported.
        (WebCore::SegmentedString::characterMismatch): Added. Used by advancePast.

        * xml/parser/CharacterReferenceParserInlines.h:
        (WebCore::unconsumeCharacters): Use toString rather than toStringPreserveCapacity
        because the SegmentedString is going to take ownership of the string.

        a String, not a SegmentedString. Also use advancePastNonNewline.

        * xml/parser/MarkupTokenizerInlines.h: Added ADVANCE_PAST_NON_NEWLINE_TO.

        and initialized most data members.
        * xml/parser/XMLDocumentParserLibxml2.cpp:

        [css-grid] Move attributes from RenderGrid to the new Grid class
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165065

        A new class called Grid was added in 208973. This is the first of a couple of patches moving
        private attributes from RenderGrid to Grid.

        Apart from that this is adding a couple of new helper functions that will decouple the
        existence of in-flow items from the actual data structures storing that information.

        Last but not least, the Grid::insert() method does not only insert the item in the m_grid
        data structure, but also stores the GridArea associated to that item, so there is no need to
        do it in two different calls.

        Rename valueOr to value_or. This is specified in C++17 proposal.

        Use Optional::emplace. C++17 Optional::operator=(Optional&&) requires
        either copy assignment operator or move assignment operator. But
        DFG::JSValueOperand etc. only defines move constructors and drop
        implicit copy assignment operators.

        It was OK in the previous WTF::Optional since it always uses move
        constructors. But it is not valid in C++17 Optional. We use Optional::emplace
        instead. This function has the same semantics to the previous WTF::Optional's
        operator=.

        Composited negative z-index elements are hidden behind the body sometimes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165080
        rdar://problem/22260229

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        If the <body> falls into the "directly composited background color" code path
        (say, because it's composited because of composited negative z-index children,
        and has content of its own), then we failed to take root background propagation
        into account, and put the opaque root background color on the body's layer.

        Fix by sharing some code from RenderBox related to whether the body's renderer
        paints its background.
        
        Tests cover the buggy case, and the case where the <html> has its own background color.

        [CSS Font Loading] FontFace.load() promises don't always fire
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165037

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We currently handle web fonts in two phases. The first phase is building up
        StyleRuleFontFace objects which reflect the style on the page. The second is creating
        CSSFontFace objects from those StyleRuleFontFace objects. When script modifies the
        style on the page, we can often update the CSSFontFace objects, but there are some
        modifications which we don't know how to model. For these operations, we destroy the
        CSSFontFace objects and rebuild them from the newly modified StyleRuleFontFace objects.

        Normally, this is fine. However, with the CSS font loading API, the CSSFontFaces back
        Javascript objects which will persist across the rebuilding step mentioned above. This
        means that the FontFace objects need to adopt the new CSSFontFace objects and forget
        the old CSSFontFace objects.

        This gets a little tricky because the operation which caused the rebuild may actually
        be a modification to the specific @font-face block which backs a Javascript FontFace
        object. Because the CSSOM can be used to change the src: attribute of the FontFace
        object, I decided in r201971 to clear the FontFace's promise in case an old load would
        cause the promise to resolve. However, this would never happen because the old
        CSSFontFace is unparented during the FontFace::adopt()ion of the new CSSFontFace.
        Therefore, old loads may still complete, but the signal would never make it to the
        FontFace and therefore would not cause the promise to resolve. In addition, clearing
        the promise during a rebuild is problematic because that rebuild may be caused by
        operations which have nothing to do with the specific FontFace object in question (so
        the FontFace object should be observably uneffected.)

        Because of the above reasons, this patch simply stops clearing the promise during the
        rebuild phase.

        On iOS we know that there is really only one web process in play at a time,
        so it's okay to do a synchronous GC immediately in response to high memory pressure.

        On other platforms, we may have tens or hundreds of web processes, and if they
        all start doing full GCs at the same time, it can easily bring a system to its knees
        if it's already under pressure.

        [css-grid] Convert grid representation into a class
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165042

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        So far grids are represented as Vectors of Vectors. There are a couple of issues associated
        to that decision. First or all, the source code in RenderGrid assumes the existence of that
        data structure, meaning that we cannot eventually change it without changing a lot of
        code. Apart from the coupling there is another issue, RenderGrid is full of methods to
        access and manipulate that data structure.

        Instead, it'd be much better to have a Grid class encapsulating both the data structures and
        the methods required to access/manipulate it. Note that follow-up patches will move even
        more data and procedures into this new class from the RenderGrid code.

        No new tests required as this is a refactoring.

        [css-grid] Isolate size of internal representation from actual grid size
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165006

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        RenderGrid has an internal representation of a grid used to place grid items, compute grid
        positions, run the track sizing algorithm etc. That data structure normally has exactly the
        same size as the actual grid specified using the grid-template-xxx properties (or any other
        shorthand). But in some cases, like for example when the grid is empty, the internal data
        structure does not really match the actual grid. In the particular case of empty grids no
        memory allocations are done to create a grid representation as it is not needed.

        From now on both gridColumnCount() and gridRowCount() will always return the size of the
        data structure representing the grid whereas the newly added numTracks() will always return
        the actual size of the grid.

        This is the first required step of the process of isolating the data used by the grid track
        sizing algorithm from the actual internal state of the LayoutGrid object.

        No new tests as this is just a code refactoring.

        [iOS WK2] When zoomed in and panning on pages with fixed bars, parts of the bars are sometimes missing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164855

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        During UI-process panning and zooming, we send visible rect updates to the web process
        with inStableState=false, and don't update GraphicsLayers until we get into a stable state.

        This causes a problem where the web process has a stale notion of where the GraphicsLayers
        for position:fixed elements are, but is then told to update tiling coverage with an up-to-date
        visible rect. The existing "sync layer positions" path isn't useful to fix this, because it
        breaks the relationship between the GraphicsLayer positions and their FixedPositionViewportConstraints
        in the scrolling tree.

        To address this, add the notion of an Optional<> approximatePosition on GraphicsLayers. This is used
        only by the coverageRect computation code path, and is cleared by a setPosition(). ApproximatePositions
        are pushed onto GraphicsLayers via the syncViewportConstrainedLayerPositions() code path (renamed to
        reconcileViewportConstrainedLayerPositions).

        This allows us to remmove "viewportIsStable" from GraphicsLayer flushing, and FrameView.

        SetOrSyncScrollingLayerPosition is made into an enum class.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The bug was caused by FocusNavigationScope::parentInScope incorrectly returning nullptr when moving out of
        a user agent shadow tree of a SVG use element. Fixed the bug by explicitly checking against the focus scope's
        root node or its slot element. Also removed a superfluous early return when the parent node is a focus scope.

        [iOS WK2] Eliminate a source of flakiness in layout tests by forcing WebPage into "responsive" mode for all tests, with an internals override
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164980

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        WebPage::eventThrottlingDelay() uses a latency estimate based on the round-trip time from the UI process
        to affect behavior, including whether scroll events are fired. This also affects the FrameView "scrolledByUser"
        flag that impacts tile coverage.

        During testing, latency falling above or below the 16ms threshold could affect behavior. Fix by forcing
        WebPage into "responsive" mode while running tests, via InjectedBundlePage::prepare().

        Add a nullable internals property so that a test can specify responsive, unresponsive or default behavior.

        [WebGL2] Implement texStorage2D()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164493

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Create a new validation function which only accepts sized internalFormats.
        After running texStorage2D(), we also texSubImage2D() to zero-fill it. This
        is to compensate for potentially buggy drivers.

        Because glTexStorage2D() was only added to OpenGL in version 4.2, not all
        OpenGL 3.2+ contexts can implement this command. However, according to
        https://developer.apple.com/opengl/capabilities/ all Apple GPUs have the
        GL_ARB_texture_storage which implements this call. In the future, we could
        implement texStorage2D() on top of texImage2D() if there are any ports which
        want WebGL2 but don't have 4.2 and don't have the extension.

        Also, when calling texStorage2D, callers specify an internalFormat but not a
        type/format pair. This means that storing the texture's type is only valid
        for WebGL 1 contexts. This patch surrounds all calls to reading the texture
        type with guards and adds an ASSERT() at the read site to make sure the
        right thing is happening.

        Support IDN2008 with UTS #46 instead of IDN2003
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144194

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Use uidna_nameToASCII instead of the deprecated uidna_IDNToASCII.
        It uses IDN2008 instead of IDN2003, and it uses UTF #46 when used with a UIDNA opened with uidna_openUTS46.
        This follows https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-domain-to-ascii except we do not use Transitional_Processing
        to prevent homograph attacks on german domain names with "ß" and "ss" in them.  These are now treated as separate domains.
        Firefox also doesn't use Transitional_Processing. Chrome and the current specification use Transitional_processing,
        but https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/110 might change the spec.
        
        In addition, http://unicode.org/reports/tr46/ says:
        "implementations are encouraged to apply the Bidi and ContextJ validity criteria"
        Bidi checks prevent domain names with bidirectional text, such as latin and hebrew characters in the same domain.  Chrome and Firefox do this.

        ContextJ checks prevent code points such as U+200D, which is a zero-width joiner which users would not see when looking at the domain name.
        Firefox currently enables ContextJ checks and it is suggested by UTS #46, so we'll do it.

        ContextO checks, which we do not use and neither does any other browser nor the spec, would fail if a domain contains code points such as U+30FB,
        which looks somewhat like a dot.  We can investigate enabling these checks later.

        Covered by new API tests and rebased LayoutTests.
        The new API tests verify that we do not use transitional processing, that we do apply the Bidi and ContextJ checks, but not ContextO checks.

        [CSS Font Loading] FontFaceSet.load() promises don't always fire
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164902

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Test: fast/text/fontfaceset-rebuild-during-loading.html

        We currently handle web fonts in two phases. The first phase is building up
        StyleRuleFontFace objects which reflect the style on the page. The second is creating
        CSSFontFace objects from those StyleRuleFontFace objects. When script modifies the
        style on the page, we can often update the CSSFontFace objects, but there are some
        modifications which we don't know how to model. For these operations, we destroy the
        CSSFontFace objects and rebuild them from the newly modified StyleRuleFontFace objects.

        Normally, this is fine. However, with the CSS font loading API, the CSSFontFaces back
        Javascript objects which will persist across the rebuilding step mentioned above. This
        means that the FontFace objects need to adopt the new CSSFontFace objects and forget
        the old CSSFontFace objects.

        There was one bit of state which I forgot to update during this rebuilding phase. The
        FontFaceSet object contains an internal HashMap where a reference to a CSSFontFace
        is used as a key. After the rebuilding phase, this reference wasn't updated to point
        to the new CSSFontFace.

        The solution is to instead use a reference to the higher-level FontFace as the key to
        the HashMap. This object is persistent across the rebuilding phase (and it adopts
        the new CSSFontFaces). There is not a lifetime problem because the FontFace holds a
        strong reference to its backing CSSFontFace object.

        This bug didn't cause a memory problem because the HashMap was keeping the old
        CSSFontFace alive because the key was a strong reference.

        This patch also adds a lengthy comment explaining how the migration works.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This happens sometimes since r208511 because the same decoder is used by more than one thread at the same
        time and the decoders are not thread-safe. Several methods in ImageDecoder need to decode partially the image,
        so it's possible that one method calls frameBufferAtIndex at the same times as createFrameImageAtIndex that now
        can be called from the image decoder thread. Use a Lock in ImageDecoder to protect calls to frameBufferAtIndex.

        Restore pre-r208672 behavior where we do not ref the script execution context in the
        background thread since this is unsafe. We use WTFMove(m_scriptExecutionContext)
        instead of m_scriptExecutionContext.copyRef(). Before r208672, it was calling
        m_scriptExecutionContext.releaseNonNull() because m_scriptExecutionContext was a
        RefPtr instead of a Ref. Note that copyRef() causes 2 issues here:
        1. It refs the scriptExecutionContext in a non-main thread which is unsafe and asserts.
        2. The point of this postTask in the destructor is to make sure the scriptExecutionContext
           gets destroyed in the main thread so we definitely want to *transfer* ownership of
           m_scriptExecutionContext to the main thread, not ref it to pass it to the main thread.

        [WebCore] Clean up script loading code in XML
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161651

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This patch cleans up XML document script handling by using PendingScript.
        Previously, we directly used CachedScript. But it is not good since we
        have PendingScript wrapper.

        We also disable ES6 modules for non HTML document. While ES6 modules tag
        requires "defer" semantics, "defer" semantics is not implemented in non
        HTML documents. And ES6 module tag is only specified in whatwg HTML spec.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Updated our implementation of slotchange event to match the latest specification after:
        https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/571
        https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#signal-a-slot-change
        The new behavior matches that of Google Chrome Canary.

        In the latest specification, we no longer dispatch a separate event on ancestor slots.
        Instead, we fire a single slotchange event to which a new node is assigned or from which
        an existing assigned node is removed. This patch mostly removes the code that existed to
        locate ancestor slot elements, and makes the event bubble up by changing a single line in
        HTMLSlotElement::dispatchSlotChangeEvent.

        [ES6] Integrate ES6 Modules into WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148897

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This patch introduces ES6 Modules into WebCore. We integrate JSC's JSModuleLoader into WebCore.
        JSC constructs the module loader pipeline by the chains of the promises. To handle this,
        the following components are added.

            1. CachedModuleScript

                CachedModuleScript wraps the promise based JSModuleLoader pipeline and offers
                similar APIs to CachedScript. ScriptElement and PendingScript interact with
                CachedModuleScript when the script tag is the module tag instead of CachedScript.
                ScriptElement and PendingScript will receive the notification from
                CachedModuleScript by implementing CachedModuleScriptClient.

            2. ScriptModuleLoader

                This is the module loader instantiated per document. It manages fetching and
                offers the callbacks for the JSC's JSModuleLoader implementation. ScriptModuleLoader
                will fetch the resource by creating CachedModuleScriptLoader per resource. ScriptModuleLoader
                will receive the notification by implementing CachedModuleScriptLoaderClient. When the
                resource is fetched, the module loader will drive the promise resolve/reject chain.

            3. CachedModuleScriptLoader

                This fetches the resource by using CachedScript. Using CachedScript means that it
                automatically reports the resource to the inspector. CachedModuleScriptLoader notify to
                ScriptModuleLoader when the resource is fetched.

        One tricky point is that the fetch requests issued from one module-graph should share the same
        nonce, crossorigin attributes etc.

            Here, we wrote the module graph like `A -> B (A depends on B)`.

            <script tag> -> A -> B -> C -> D

        When fetching A, B, C, and D modules, we need to set the same nonce, crossorigin etc. configuration
        derived from the original script tag. So per module-graph information should be shared throughout
        the module loader pipeline. To do so, JSC's module loader implementation can take the value called
        `initiator`. Since the loader will propagate & share this `initiator` throughout the pipeline,
        we can transfer and share some metadata. Currently, we pass the JSWrapper of the script tag as the
        initiator. Each fetch request is created by using this initiator script element.

        More integration into the inspector should be done in the subsequent patch.

        CachedModuleScriptLoader is responsible to fetching the resource for the module script. It uses propagated `initiator`
        to create the request. This initiator is the JS wrapper of the script element issuing this fetching request. The name
        `initiator` is derived from the request.setInitiator(). Once the resource is fetched, the fetcher will notify to the
        client. Currently, ScriptModuleLoader implements this client interface.

        (WebCore::ScriptController::linkAndEvaluateModuleScript):
        This executes the linking and evaluation of the already instantiated module graph. After loading the module graph,
        we call this function for the module to evaluate it. This is called from ScriptElement::executeModuleScript.
        (WebCore::ScriptController::evaluateModule):
        Every time we evaluate the module, the ScriptModuleLoader::evaluate hook is called. So the loader calls this function
        to actually evaluate the module.
        (WebCore::jsValueToModuleKey):
        (WebCore::ScriptController::setupModuleScriptHandlers):
        The JSC's module loader is driven by the chain of the promise. So here, we convert this to CachedModuleScript /
        CachedModuleScriptClient style and encapsulate the details. This encapsulation makes CachedModuleScript similar
        to CachedScript and it makes things simple in the rest of WebCore. If the propagated error is already reported
        to the inspector, we receive moduleLoaderAlreadyReportedErrorSymbol as the error value. So at that case, we
        don't report it twice. If the rejection is caused due to the canceled fetching, moduleLoaderFetchingIsCanceledSymbol
        appears as the error value. In that case, we will call CachedModuleScript::notifyLoadWasCanceled.

        (WebCore::ScriptController::moduleLoaderFetchingIsCanceledSymbol):
        * bindings/js/ScriptModuleLoader.cpp:
        We use DeferredWrapper to resolve promises used for the module pipeline. Thus, once the active DOM objects are
        suspended, the module loader propagation stops.
        (WebCore::ScriptModuleLoader::~ScriptModuleLoader):
        Clear the clients of the fetchers issued from this loader.
        (WebCore::isRootModule):
        (WebCore::ScriptModuleLoader::resolve):
        Resolve the module specifier (that is written in `import from "XXX"`) to the unique module key. We use URL
        string as module key. The edge case is that the module is inlined one. In that case, we don't have any URL
        for that. Instead of URL, we use symbol at that time.
        (WebCore::ScriptModuleLoader::fetch):
        Start fetching for the requested module. It returns the promise that is resolved when the fetching is done.
        The loader creates the fetcher, and the fetcher start loading the resource. Once the fetcher loads the resource,
        it notify to the loader through CachedModuleScriptLoaderClient interface. Since we pass the original script
        element as the `initiator` here, the fetcher can use this initiator to create the request. While the result of
        CachedResource has 3 variations (loaded, canceled, error occurred), Promise only tells us whether it is resolved
        or rejected. When CachedModuleScript gets the result from the promise chain, it needs to know which the result is.
        To transfer the canceled information, we reject the promise with the special symbol `moduleLoaderAlreadyReportedErrorSymbol`.
        This offers the way to distinguish the canceled error from the other errors.
        (WebCore::ScriptModuleLoader::evaluate):
        This is the hook function that is called when JSC's JSModuleLoader attempts to execute each module.
        (WebCore::ScriptModuleLoader::notifyFinished):
        This function is called when the fetcher completes. We will resolve the promise with the result of the fetching.
        The module loader pipeline is constructed as a chain of promises.
        Rejecting a promise when some error occurs is important because the execution flow of
        the promise chain is driven by "rejected" or "fulfilled" events.
        If the promise is not rejected while error occurs, reject handler won't be executed
        and all the subsequent promise chain will wait the result forever.
        As a result, even if the error is already reported to the inspector elsewhere,
        it should be propagated in the pipeline. For example, the error of loading
        CachedResource is already reported to the inspector by the loader. But we still need
        to reject the promise to propagate this error to the script element.
        At that time, we don't want to report the same error twice. When we propagate the error
        that is already reported to the inspector, we throw moduleLoaderAlreadyReportedErrorSymbol
        symbol instead. By comparing the thrown error with this symbol, we can distinguish errors raised
        when checking syntax of a module script from errors reported already.
        In the reject handler of the promise, we only report a error that is not this symbol.
        And mime type checking is done here since the module script always require this check.

        [iOS WK2] Implement support for visual viewports
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164765

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Adopt the visual viewport scrolling model in iOS WK2.

        This is more complex than the Mac implementation for two primary reasons. First,
        WKWebView needs to to able to control the rectangle used for fixed position layout
        to get the correct behavior when zooming all the way out, and because iOS displays
        pages scaled down, exposing document overflow such that the layout viewport rectangle
        has to get larger than the initial containing block size (which does not happen on Mac).

        This is achieved by pushing a "layoutViewportOverrideRect" down onto FrameView, in
        a similar way to the customFixedPositionRect that's used now. We share that name
        for now in code that is agnostic to its use (e.g. VisibleContentRectUpdateInfo).

        I tried so hard to write tests, but ran into various problems (webkit.org/b/164762,
        webkit.org/b/164764). Will add tests via webkit.org/b/164764.

        Test: fast/forms/search-cancel-button-change-input.html

        It is possible for JavaScript to change the type property of an input field. WebKit
        needs to gracefully handle this case.

        Add a type traits specialization so we can properly downcast InputType elements.
        Use this to only call search functions on actual search input types.

        * html/HTMLInputElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::onSearch): Only perform search functions if the
        input type is actually a search field.
        * html/InputType.h: Add type traits specialization for 'downcast' template.
        * html/SearchInputType.h: Ditto.

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Return the values stated in the ARIA 1.1 spec, namely:
        - aria-valuemin is 0 for roles other than spinbutton
        - aria-valuemax is 100 for roles other than spinbutton
        - aria-valuenow is half way between aria-valuemax and aria-valuemin
          for roles other than spinbutton, and 0 for spinbutton

        For spinbutton, the spec states that "there is no minimum/maximum value."
        But at least in the case of ATK/AT-SPI2, the accessible value interface
        is expected to provide a number. Therefore, expose the values we use to
        constrain input type="number": -std::numeric_limits<float>::max() and
        std::numeric_limits<float>::max().

        1. It updates the SubtleCrypto::exportKey method to match the latest spec:
           https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#SubtleCrypto-method-exportKey.
           It also refers to the latest Editor's Draft to a certain degree:
           https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html#SubtleCrypto-method-exportKey.
        2. It implements exportKey operations of the following algorithms: AES-CBC, AES-KW,
           HMAC, RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5, RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5, and RSA-OAEP.
        3. It also fixes the following bugs:

        Disallow loads using HTTP 0.9 at the ResourceHandle/NetworkDataTask level

        Currently we disallow non-default HTTP 0.9 loads at the ResourceLoader level and disallow
        subresource loads using HTTP 0.9 on a default port when the embedding page loads using a
        different HTTP version. However loads can still be initiated from other loaders (e.g. FrameLoader)
        with regards to the first issue. The latter issue does not afford much protection and
        increases code complexity. Instead we should simplify our policy and move our code to the
        lowest networking abstraction level, ResourceHandle/NetworkDataTask, so that we disallow
        all non-default port loads using HTTP 0.9 regardless of the loader used.

        [WebGL2] Teach WebGLRenderingContextBase about new texture internal formats

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Test: fast/canvas/webgl/webgl2-texture-upload-enums.html

        This patch migrates the existing WebGL calls texImage2D(), texSubImage2D(),
        and readPixels() to understand the new WebGL 2 texture types. In WebGL1, the
        format and the internalFormat were required to be the same, and we had this
        assumption baked into many places in these functions. In WebGL 2, those two
        values are often different, which means I had to fix all of these assumptions
        in our code. Also, rather than have two completely separate parallel
        implementations of these functions, a more forward-looking approach is to
        have one implementation which has a few checks to isWebGL1() in strategic
        places. (This way, bugs only have to be fixed in a single place). Therefore,
        this patch deletes the WebGL 2 versions of these functions.

        Scrolling when zoomed doesn't always use the correct layout viewport
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164756

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The scrolling thread was always using the layout viewport rect pushed onto it and
        never computing a new one, so when scrolling around after zooming position:fixed
        elements would not get the expected visual viewport behavior.

        Fix by having ScrollingTreeFrameScrollingNode updating its notion of the layout viewport
        on scrolls.

        Not testable because we can't dump the scrolling tree on Mac (yet).

        document.createElementNS doesn't construct a custom element

        Also made constructCustomElementSynchronously not call the custom element constructors with the element's

        [SVG] Moving more special casing of SVG out of the bindings - SVGNumber/SVGPoint/SVGRect/SVGLength/SVGTransform/SVGMatrix
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164696

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        - Make SVGNumber, SVGPoint, SVGRect, SVGLength, SVGTransform and SVGMatrix
          real classes and stop special casing them in the bindings generator. This 
          removes the remaining non-list SVG specializations from the bindings generator.
        - Renamed existing SVGLength, SVGTransform and SVGMatrix to SVGLengthValue, 
          SVGTransformValue and SVGMatrixValue. There are no SVNumberValue, SVGPointValue 
          and SVGRectValue classes, as float, FloatPoint and FloatRect can be used 
          directly. Going forward, we can get rid of SVGMatrixValue as well, and just
          use AffineTransform, but that will be done in a separate change.

        [GStreamer][OWR] poor video rendering in apprtc
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164585

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        The apprtc service uses 3 video elements in total, one for local, one
        for remote and one called preview. During a call only remote and
        preview are displayed, preview being linked to the same mediastream as
        local. The consequence is that 2 OWR video renderers of the same
        source are created. When gst-gl is enabled this isn't a problem but
        when it is disabled a performance issue appears and the webkit video
        sink starts dropping frames.

        The solution is to have the video renderer shared between the 2
        media players in this scenario.

        In particular, we no longer split the input qualifiedName into a prefix and a

        Instead, we keep the input qualifiedName as is and compare it to the element's
        qualifiedName. This matters for HTML elements inside an HTML document that have
        a semicolon in their localname (e.g. 'wx:map'). For this example, the element's
        localName and its qualified name are both 'wx:map'. Calling
        getElementsByTagName('wx:map') should return it. However, if you split the input
        qualifiedName into a prefix and a localName, you end up checking:
        'wx' == null && 'map' == 'wx:map'
        which does not match.

        Removed some old abstraction layers that were no longer in use. For example,
        i n many cases, calls were going through DatabaseManager, which called through
        an abstract class AbstractDatabaseServer to a concrete class DatabaseServer,
        which then called through to DatabaseTracker. Clients now mostly just call
        DatabaseTracker directly.

        * Modules/webdatabase/Database.cpp:
        (WebCore::Database::Database): Use a reference instead of a RefPtr&& for database
        context. Use unsigned instead of unsigned long. Modernize code to use more
        initialization rather than assignment, to initialize scalar data members in the
        class definition, and to use HashMap::ensure.
        (WebCore::Database::databaseThread): Added. This class asserts that there is a
        thread in the constructor, and so it is useful to have a helper for all the other
        functions that assumes the thread is present and returns a reference rather than
        a pointer.

        (WebCore::Database::securityOrigin): Changed to return a reference instead of a
        pointer because all the callers need it to do that. If called on the wrong thread,
        this will now do a RELEASE_ASSERT_NOT_REACHED. In the old code it would return a
        null pointer and then the caller would dereference it a moment later, so it would
        still be a crash.
        (WebCore::Database::maximumSize): Removed const since it's not really needed and
        the DatabaseTracker wants a non-const reference to this database.
        (WebCore::Database::didCommitWriteTransaction): Added. Moved this code here from
        SQLTransactionClient. There is no abstraction layer, so no reason to not have
        this code, quite comparable to the rest of the code in the class, here. I am

        [iOS WK2] Share some code with Mac for post-async-scroll state reconciliation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164694

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        When an async scroll notifications get back to the main thread in
        AsyncScrollingCoordinator::updateScrollPositionAfterAsyncScroll(), we call 
        syncViewportConstrainedLayerPositions() to poke the new layer positions on the
        GraphicsLayers to match the changes made on the scrolling thread.

        However, this was not done on iOS, which will be problematic for a future patch
        where we require GraphicsLayer positions and the current fixedPositionViewport rect
        to have been computed when in a consistent state.

        Fix by factoring some code into reconcileScrollingState(), which is called on iOS/WK2
        from WebPage::updateVisibleContentRects() rather than setting the FrameView's scroll offset
        directly.

        RenderObject::flowThreadState should follow containing block instead of parent.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164629

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Currently every descendant of a region/multicolumn container is considered to be part of the
        flowthread including out-of-flow renderers. They all have the InsideFlowThread flag set.
        However since out-of-flow renderers are not really part of the flowthread layout context,
        whenever the layout code actually checks for their flowthread containers, we return nullptr and
        try to handle this seemingly defective state gracefully (that is, flag indicates "inside the flow thread" state,
        but there's no flow tread container).
 
        This patch fixes this confused state by setting the RenderObject::flowThreadState flag based on
        the containing block's state instead of the parent's.

        Not testable, since we seem to manage out-of-flow elements just fine even
        when they have the InsideFlowThread flag set.

        MathML layoutBlock functions. Additionally, we ensure that the preferred width is dirty after
        computation in RenderMathMLScripts::computePreferredLogicalWidths.

        Remove RenderMathMLOperator::shouldAllowStretching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164313

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        RenderMathMLOperator::shouldAllowStretching is an old function from early implementations of
        MathML. Its name is now confusing since it also includes non-stretchy large operators.
        Moreover, it is not really useful and is actually only used by two functions: useMathOperator
        and updateMathOperator. The former is almost equivalent and is used as a replacement of
        shouldAllowStretching everywhere else. We rewrite the two remaining calls with the finer
        test functions isStretchy() and isLargeOperatorInDisplayStyle().

        No new tests, behavior unchanged.

        (WebCore::RenderMathMLOperator::updateMathOperator): Reorder the conditionals to avoid the

        Fixed the bug by including WindowContext be a part of the regular EventPath. This also simplifies

        Also fixed a bug in EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent that event.target would be nullptr when an event was
        dispatched inside a disconnected shadow tree or prevented from propagating to the document tree.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The bug was caused by HitTestResult::innerElement returning the parent element of a Text node without
        taking the shadow root or slots into account. For hit testing, we always want to use the "flat tree"
        or "composed tree" (imprecisely but close enough in this case).

        Fixed the bug by making HitTestResult::innerElement use parentNodeInComposedTree. Also renamed it to

        WorkerGlobalScope's indexedDB property should be on the prototype, not the instance
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164644

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        WorkerGlobalScope's indexedDB property should be on the prototype, not the instance
        as per:
        - https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-attributes

        This is because WorkerGlobalScope is not marked as [Global] or [PrimaryGlobal] in
        the IDL:
        - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#the-workerglobalscope-common-interface

        DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope is the one that is marked as [Global] and that should
        have its attributes on the instance:
        - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dedicated-workers-and-the-dedicatedworkerglobalscope-interface

        We were getting this mostly right, except for runtime-enabled attributes / operations
        which would end up on the instance instead of the prototype. This patch adds support
        for [PrimaryGlobal] / [Global] IDL extended attributes which determine the location
        of properties. It also improves support for runtime-enabled properties so that they
        can now be on either the instance or the prototype, exactly as if they were not
        runtimed-enabled.

        This gives us 100% pass rate on:
        - http://w3c-test.org/IndexedDB/interfaces.worker.html

        No new tests, updated existing test.

        Reduce number of platformMemoryUsage calls
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164375

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        platformMemoryUsage was being called all the time while logging the
        results of various memory-purging operations. This logging is
        subordinate to the needs of performance and so can be removed.
        Behavior is now as follows:

        - If memory-pressure relief logging is enabled, logging includes
        memory usage information. On Cocoa, this logging is disabled by
        default but can be enabled by setting LogMemoryJetsamDetails in
        `defaults`.
        - Otherwise, if release-logging is enabled (as it is on Cocoa),
        abbreviated memory pressure relief logging is performed: the logging
        lines are printed but without any memory usage information.
        - Otherwise, no logging is performed.

        No new tests -- no tests for logging.

        RenderFlowThread's containing block cache should be invalidated before calling styleDidChange.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164646

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We have to invalidate the containing block cache for RenderFlowThreads soon after the containing block context
        changes. Invalidating it in RenderBlock::styleDidChange is too late since we might run some code in some

        [css-grid] ASSERTION FAILED: !m_gridIsDirty in WebCore::RenderGrid::gridRowCount
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163450

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The issue is that in the test case a simplifiedLayout() is performed.
        So in RenderGrid::layoutBlock() we early return and the grid is not populated,
        so the m_gridIsDirty flag is not cleared when we try to check the size of the grid
        in RenderGrid::layoutPositionedObject().

        We should avoid to do a simplified layout if we have to layout
        some positioned grid items and the grid is dirty.

        The problem was not only the ASSERT, but the current behavior was wrong too.
        As we didn't do a proper layout of the grid container, the positioned item
        won't be placed on the expected position. Added tests verifying this.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch implements document.body accessor. To implement it, we need,

        REGRESSION(r207182): [iOS] Crash because of passing freed CFDictionaryRef to CG when decoding a sub-sampled large image
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164617

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        This covered by the test fast/images/image-subsampling.html but it should
        run with --guard-malloc --repeat-each=10 to show the bug or to verify the
        fix.

        imageSourceOptions() returns a non static RetainPtr<CFDictionaryRef> if
        the subsamplingLevel is not zero. Because we are assigning the raw pointer
        to a local variable in ImageDecoder::createFrameImageAtIndex(), CFRelease()
        is called for the CFDictionaryRef immediately after this assignment. This
        causes its memory to be freed in this case even before calling CG.

        This bug does not happen if the subsamplingLevel is zero because we cache
        the returned value in a static NeverDestroyed<RetainPtr<CFDictionaryRef> in
        imageSourceOptions(). This cache prevents the CFDictionaryRef from being
        freed in ImageDecoder::createFrameImageAtIndex() no matter where CFRelease()
        is called.

        The fix is hold the returned value in a RetainPtr<CFDictionaryRef>. This
        will ensure the CFDictionaryRef raw pointer is valid till the end of
        ImageDecoder::createFrameImageAtIndex().

        * platform/graphics/cg/ImageDecoderCG.cpp:

        REGRESSION (r195004): Scripts and plugins blocked for subsequent loads in same WebContent
        process after receiving HTTP 0.9 response
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164387
        <rdar://problem/28987537>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Fixes an issue where the HTTP 0.9 sandbox persisted across subsequent loads in the same
        WebContent process.

        Currently when an HTTP 0.9 response is received for a request made to a default port
        (e.g. 80) we apply a sandbox policy on the FrameLoader for the main resource that
        disallows scripts and plugins. A FrameLoader may be re-used for navigations. Therefore,
        the sandbox policy applied to one site may be applied to another site. Moreover the
        sandbox policy was applied to the FrameLoader of the main resource regardless of whether
        the HTTP response was for a subresource. Instead we should apply the sandbox on a per-
        Document basis and only if we receive an HTTP 0.9 response for the document when the
        corresponding HTTP request was made to a default port.

        As a side benefit of this change, we emit exactly one console message to Web Inspector
        when the HTTP 0.9 sandbox is applied to a document as opposed to three console messages.
        Moreover, we only emit this console message when the document load is not blocked.

        Test: http/tests/security/http-0.9/sandbox-should-not-persist-on-navigation.html

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::initSecurityContext): Disallow scripts and plugins if an HTTP 0.9
        response was received for this document. Note that if this function is called for a
        document associated with an HTTP 0.9 response then the corresponding HTTP request was
        made to a default port. DocumentLoader::responseReceived() blocks the load for a document
        with an HTTP 0.9 response corresponding to an HTTP request made to a non-default port.
        This invariant is covered by the tests LayoutTests/http/tests/security/http-0.9/default-port-{plugin, script}-blocked.html.

        Update SubtleCrypto::importKey to match the latest spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164446
        <rdar://problem/29123621>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        This patch does following few things:
        1. It updates the SubtleCrypto::importKey method to match the latest spec:
           https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#SubtleCrypto-method-importKey.
           It also refers to the latest Editor's Draft at a certain degree:
           https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html#SubtleCrypto-method-importKey.
        2. It implements importKey operations of following algorithms: AES-CBC, AES-KW,
           HMAC, RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5, RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5, and RSA-OAEP.
        3. It fixes some minor problems of SubtleCrypto::generateKey.
        4. It addes move constructors for CryptoKeyAES, CryptoKeyHMAC, CryptoKeyRSA and
           CryptoKeyDataRSAComponents.
        5. It renames HmacKeyGenParams to HmacKeyParams to serve the purpose of both
           HmacKeyGenParams and HmacImportParams which are essentially the same.
        6. It enforces the key length in bits of CryptoKeyHMAC to be multiples of 8.
        7. It also fixes the following bugs:
           https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126033,
           https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126034,

        P.S. We currently only support Raw and Jwk key format.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164028

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        Add no-op implementation of the Web-facing APIs as defined in
        the EME specification. This will be the basis for implementing
        the various algorithms the same specification defines, and for
        implementing the relevant platform abstractions.

        Dictionaries and enumerations defined by the specification are
        defined in separate headers, and not in the implementation files
        for the class where they are used. This will ease their use
        across different implementation files.

        BufferSource now exposes the Variant object it holds. This is
        needed to support the iterable property on the MediaKeyStatusMap
        class.

        CodeGeneratorJS is fixed to support JS-to-native conversion of
        sequences of dictionaries.

        [Modern Media Controls] Media Controller: update controls based on fullscreen playback on macOS
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164554

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When toggling fullscreen on macOS, toggle between MacOSInlineMediaControls and MacOSFullscreenMediaControls.
        To facilitate this, support objects are created and destroyed when changing the controls in order for the
        right control objects to be hooked up to the media controller. A new destroy() method on MediaControllerSupport
        subclasses can be overridden to remove event listeners added by support objects in their constructor.

        [Linux] Memory values shown by memory pressure handler logger are not useful
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164589

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        We are currently using the VmSize field from /proc/self/status which is the virtual memory size of the process
        and doesn't normally change even when the memory pressure handler manages to release memory. So, most of the
        time we see that there's no changes in memory usage in the logs.
        We should use the actual memory used by the process, memory that the process can release and then it's relevant
        for the memory pressure handler. Using other fields from /proc/self/status we could do something like VmRSS -
        (RssFile + RssShme), but there's also /proc/self/statm that provides the same information in a single. The main
        different is that statm provides both resident and shared memory directly, but in number of pages, so we need to
        multiply by the size of the page.
        This patch adds a method to parse /proc/self/statm in its given file, because I plan to use this for the linux
        memory sampler that is incorrectly parsing /proc/self/statm.

        MemoryPressureHandler shouldn't know how to release WebCore memory
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160497

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        All processes should set their own low memory handler, instead of leaving the web process using the default one
        that needs to access APIs that are not in platform layer. This patch fixes all the layering violations in the
        MemoryPressureHandler. Since the default implementation, that releases the WebCore memory, is shared by the
        WebProcess in WebKit2 and WebKit1 ports, it has been moved to its own file to the WebCore layer.

        [css-grid] Fix fr tracks sizing under min|max-size constraints
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150674

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The min|max-sizes must be used to compute the flex fraction for indefinite free
        spaces. According to the spec "If using this flex fraction would cause the grid to be
        smaller than the grid container’s min-width/height (or larger than the grid container’s
        max-width/height), then redo this step, treating the free space as definite and the
        available grid space as equal to the grid container’s content box size when it’s sized to
        its min-width/height (max-width/height)."

        This only affects indefinite heights because during layout both definite sizes and any kind
        of widths are properly constrained by min|max-width restrictions.

        Implement visual-viewport based position:fixed handling for Mac async scrolling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164495

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Educate the scrolling tree about visual and layout viewports. This is runtime-switchable,
        so we push the enable flag to via the root state node, then push the layout viewport,
        and the min/max scroll position that contstrain it, through frame state nodes.

        When a scroll happens, we compute a new layout viewport when the visual viewport hits
        an edge, and push that down through setScrollLayerPosition() since it's used to position
        fixed and sticky layers.

        When the main thread gets notified about an async scroll, we set the new layout viewport
        on the FrameView, but do so in such a way that does not trigger layout. This is OK because
        we do a RenderLayer update which udpates all the layoutViewport-dependent state, and is
        necessary to avoid repaints every main thread update.

        The iOS code is made to compile, but not work yet.

        There is quite a bit of special casing of SVG types in the bindings that adds

        the implementation, where it has also longed to be. 

        Starting small, with just SVGAngle. It has been split in two, with the existing
        SVGAngle being renamed SVGAngleValue, and the bound instance, which used to be name
        SVGPropertyTearOff<SVGAngle>, taking the name SVGAngle (and inheriting from

        Add test infrastructure and tests for existing HTTP 0.9 sandbox machinery

        <rdar://problem/29101072>

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Add test infrastructure to support registering an arbitrary port as the default port
        for a protocol. The behavior of various machinery, including the HTTP 0.9 machinery,
        can be effected by whether the resource request was made using the default port for
        the protocol. We expose window.internals.registerDefaultPortForProtocol() to allow
        a test to override the default port associated with a protocol so as to support
        testing these code paths using the existing port 8000 server started by run-webkit-httpd.
        Without window.internals.registerDefaultPortForProtocol() we would need to teach
        run-webkit-httpd to run a web server on port 80, which requires superuser privileges
        (since it is a privileged port number) and is more likely to interfere with an
        existing web server setup.

        and its next sibling. Normally the parent and the sibling are based on the DOM, but
        when this renderer is part of a flow thread, its insertion sibling is not necessarily the DOM sibling.
        To find the correct sibling, we call RenderNamedFlowThread's nextRendererForElement().
        RenderNamedFlowThread keeps track of its children so that it can compute the next sibling
        for the insertion point.

        This patch eliminates the need for keeping track of the child renderers of each
        flow by moving the 'next sibling' logic to RenderTreePosition.

        No change in functionality.

        IndexedDB 2.0: Clean up more transaction abort behavior, including tweaks to Index/ObjectStore lifetime.

        No new tests (Covered by existing tests that now pass).
        
        Previously, IDBIndex ref/deref didn't track a traditional ref count but instead kept the owning object store alive.
        Now, IDBObjectStore ref/deref do the same thing for the owning transaction.
        
        Now when a version change transaction is rolled back, some object stores and indexes get pulled out of the "deleted"
        set and get promoted back up into the "referenced" set.
        
        Now deleted object stores/indexes are considered opaque roots, as live objects in the deleted state *can* get back
        to the owning objects.

        TextStream-based logging was constrained by the requirement to maintain compatibility

        TextStreams whose output appears in test results are given flags to avoid behavior
        changes, but in the longer term test results should be updated.

        Add support for rendering the new color() syntax, which
        ends up as an ExtendedColor.

        In order to make rendering code a little more readable, I
        changed Color::hasAlpha to Color::isOpaque (since an alpha
        of 100% is still an alpha), and added a Color::isVisible
        helper (the color isn't completely transparent). These new
        helpers support ExtendedColor forms.

        Support for painting gradients and blending between colors
        is still to come. I also added some FIXME comments
        to show other places that don't handle ExtendedColors yet.

        AX: [ATK] Wrong selected element at a given index in a list box (redux)

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This essentially undoes the implementation change resulting from r164577.
        As stated in the ATK documentation, atk_selection_ref_selection() takes
        "a gint specifying the index in the selection set. (e.g. the ith selection
        as opposed to the ith child)." r164577 deliberately modified that, causing
        atk_selection_ref_selection() to treat the index as if it were the position
        with respect to all of the children. There is different API in ATK, namely
        atk_object_ref_accessible_child(), when the ith child from the set of all
        children is sought.

        [DOMJIT] Add DOMJIT::Signature annotation to Document::getElementById
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164356

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch implements DOMJIT::Signature annotation for getElementById.
        Since getElementById is also implemented in DocumentFragment, we implement
        the branchIfDocumentFragment/branchIfNotDocumentFragment for that.

        In dromaeo, we have a test like this.

        test( "getElementById", function(){
            for ( var i = 0; i < num * 30; i++ ) {
                ret = document.getElementById("testA" + num).nodeType;
                ret = document.getElementById("testB" + num).nodeType;
                ret = document.getElementById("testC" + num).nodeType;
                ret = document.getElementById("testD" + num).nodeType;
                ret = document.getElementById("testE" + num).nodeType;
                ret = document.getElementById("testF" + num).nodeType;
            }
        });

        In the above test, JSC already knows the following things.

        1. Since nodeType is now handled as CallDOMGetter, we know that it is pure.
        2. getElementById look up becomes PureGetById since document is impure object. But it is kept as PureGetById. So it does not write DOMState.
        3. `"testA" + num` will be converted to constant string.
        4. CallDOM for getElementById said it just reads(DOMState:DOM). And it saids that it returns the same value as long as DOMState is not clobbered.
        5. CheckCell leading CallDOM ensures the inlined getElementById node. (CallDOM node).

        The key thing is that no node clobbers DOMState during the loop. So CallDOM & CallDOMGetter can be hoisted.
        This improves dom-query significantly. Dromaeo dom-query getElementById becomes 40x faster (247796 v.s. 6197).

        Rename unscaledUnobscuredVisibleContentSize and unscaledVisibleContentSizeIncludingObscuredArea for attempted clarity
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164438

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        unscaledUnobscuredVisibleContentSize() and unscaledVisibleContentSizeIncludingObscuredArea() were an endless source
        of confusion.
        
        Functions with "VisibleContent" in the name are usually expected to return document coordinates (affected by zooming),
        so unscaledUnobscuredVisibleContentSize caused cognitive dissonance because of "unscaled" vs "visibleContent", and
        "unobscured" vs "visible".
        
        So rename:
            unscaledUnobscuredVisibleContentSize -> sizeForUnobscuredContent
            unscaledVisibleContentSizeIncludingObscuredArea -> sizeForVisibleContent
        
        sizeForUnobscuredContent() can also be private to ScrollView.

        Layout viewport wrong with RTL documents
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164434

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The layoutViewportRect was computed incorrectly in RTL documents, because 
        FrameView::unscaledMaximumScrollPosition() was wrong; it erroneously mapped
        what it thought was a scrollOffset to a scrollPosition.

        Unscaled scroll positions are in the same coordinate space as unscaledDocumentRect,
        so we should not call scrollPositionFromOffset() in FrameView::unscaledMaximumScrollPosition().

        Changed FrameView::unscaledMinimumScrollPosition() to also just grab the location of
        unscaledDocumentRect, for symmetry.

        Finally fixed the tiled scrolling indicator's viewport rect for zoomed RTL documents
        by using the unscaled scroll origin.

        Safari does not emit composition end if blurred for dead key / Japanese IME
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164369
        <rdar://problem/29050439>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        On Mac, _before_ changing selection, try to finalize the composition by calling Editor::cancelComposition early.
        This is because the focused element may have changed after performing the selection change, so we would
        otherwise be dispatching the `compositionend` to the new focused element (or no compositionend at all) instead
        of the element with the composition.

        Doing this allows us to match Chrome and Firefox behavior. After canceling the composition, we then need to also
        clear the system IME state. We do this on Mac WK1/WK2 through the cancelComposition() codepath, which ends up
        calling into -discardMarkedText, which resets the marked text state. Some minor refactoring was performed to
        accomplish this -- currently, discardedComposition sends a CompositionWasCanceled message over to the UI process
        that discards the marked text, and then updates the editor state. This patch splits this into two separate
        steps -- see the WebKit2 ChangeLog for more details.

        AX: [ATK] Attempting to clear selection on ARIA listboxes results in crash
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164331

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        The ATK code is using is<AccessibilityListBox>() to identify native listboxes.
        But is<AccessibilityListBox>() returns the value of isListBox() which returns
        true both for AccessibilityListBox instances as well as for AccessibilityObject
        instances which have an AccessibilityRole value of ListBoxRole. Because only
        native listboxes should be AccessibilityListBoxes, add isNativeListBox() so
        that we can distinguish native and ARIA listboxes.

        [WebGL2] Implement getBufferSubData()

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The call exists in OpenGL 3.2 but in order to have parity with
        OpenGL ES 3 we back it with glMapBufferRange() instead.

        This patch simply adds surface area to GraphicsContext3D
        until we can get an ANGLE implementation of it.

        When testing this patch I discovered that r207649 incorrectly
        interpreted arguments to bufferData() and bufferSubData() as
        byte offsets. Instead, they should be element indices. This
        patch fixes those functions to work correctly so that
        getBufferSubData() can be tested correctly.

        [DOMJIT] Add DOMJIT::Signature
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162980

        Reviewed by Saam Barati and Sam Weinig.

        We introduce DOMJIT::Signature. This signature object is automatically generated by IDL code generator.
        It holds (1) types, (2) pointer to the unsafe function (the function without checks), and (3) the effect
        of the function. We use constexpr to initialize DOMJIT::Signature without invoking global constructors.
        Thus the content is embedded into the binary as the constant values.

        We also clean up the IDL code generator related to DOMJIT part. Instead of switching things inside IDL
        code generator, we use C++ template to dispatch things at compile time. This template meta programming
        is highly utilized in IDL these days.

        To make DOMJIT::Signature constexpr, we also need to define DOMJIT abstract heap things in the build time.
        To do so, we introduce a tiny Ruby script to calculate the range of abstract heaps. We can offer the abstract
        heap tree as YAML format and the script will produce a C++ header holding the calculated abstract heap ranges

        The style created for reflections contains transforms and a mask, so needs to get explicit

        rdar://problem/29053414

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        After r208025 it as possible for KeyframeAnimation::animate() to produce a RenderStyle
        with a non-1 opacity, but without the explicit z-index that triggers stacking context.
        This confused the RenderLayer paintWithTransparency code, triggering mismsatched GraphicsContext
        save/restores.

        This occurred when the runningOrFillingForwards state was mis-computed. keyframeAnim->animate()
        can spit out a new style when in the StartWaitTimer sometimes, so "!keyframeAnim->waitingToStart() && !keyframeAnim->postActive()"
        gave the wrong answser.

        Rather than depend on the super-confusing animation state, use a bool out param from animate() to say
        when it actually produced a new style, and when true, do the setZIndex(0).

        [iOS] [WebGL] Multisample resolve step may operate on stale data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164347

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When antialiasing is enabled, WebKit internally creates a multisampled FBO
        and uses that as the target of all the drawing commands. Then, just before
        we actually put the image on the glass, we perform a “resolve” step which
        averages all the samples to create the final image. However, it appears
        that this resolve step only waits for commands to complete which were
        already submitted to the hardware. OpenGL is allowed (indeed, expected) to
        batch up drawing commands in main memory so it can submit them to the
        hardware in fewer batches, but this means that the hardware may not know
        about all the commands that the application submitted. Because of this,
        the data the resolve step saw is the result of only some of the previous
        draw calls - not all of them.

        This doesn’t occur on macOS because we have a different code path there
        for performing the resolve step. On iOS 9 and below, WebKit didn’t
        implement multisampling in WebGL at all, which explains why this only
        occurs on iOS 10. 

        Luckily, the OpenGL command glFlush() is exactly designed to submit any
        pending commands to the hardware.

        Allow external stylesheets within a shadow tree by storing the appropriate style scope in HTMLLinkElement
        when it's connected to a document instead of always talking to document's style scope.

        Also improve ShadowRoot's insertedInto and removedFrom so that they only try to add and remove itself from
        m_inDocumentShadowRoots when the connected-ness changes.

        This patch also removes the superfluous call to notifyChildNodeRemoved in Element::removeShadowRoot to
        avoid invoking notifyChildNodeRemoved during a document teardown, which is incorrect. It's sufficient that
        ~ShadowRoot calls ContainerNode::removeDetachedChildren(), and in turn removeDetachedChildrenInContainer()
        since the latter function tears down nodes via the deletion queue during a document destruction and use
        notifyChildNodeRemoved() on nodes that outlive the shadow root.

        Add basic visual/layout viewport support for fixed position layout
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164261

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This patch adds a new behavior for position:fixed objects on zooming. Instead of
        interpolating between two implicit viewports as we do now, have explicit and distinct
        layout and visual viewports.

        The layout viewport is always the size of the initial containing block (i.e. the RenderView).
        Position:fixed and sticky elements are laid out relative to the layout viewport.

        The visual viewport is the visible part of the view, in content coordinates.

        When the user pans and zooms, the visual viewport changes. If it hits the edge of the
        layout viepwort, it pushes the layout viewport in that direction; it's as if the user
        is dragging the layout viewport around.

        The layout viewport is maintained on FrameView, and has to be recomputed when the
        scroll position changes, when the view size changes, and when the content size (which
        affets min/max scroll position) changes. Layout viewport size and position are computed
        in unzoomed coordinates, requiring some new functions on FrameView to return these.

        Updated the TileCoverageMap to show the layout viewport visually.

        Subsequent patches will plumb the layout and visual viewports through the scrolling tree.

        This teaches WebCore that a typed array could be shared or not. By default, WebCore will
        reject shared typed arrays as if they were not typed arrays. This ensures that we don't get
        race conditions in code that can't handle it.
        
        If you postMessage a SharedArrayBuffer or something that wraps it, you will send the shared
        memory to the other worker.

        Moves state that keeps track of whether or not a dictionary lookup is active from the WebPage to the Editor, so
        that when clicking a text field or contenteditable in WK1 or WK2, we are able to avoid notifying the
        WebEditorClient of the selection change.

        Changes to WK2 are covered by existing unit tests in WKWebViewCandidateTests which verify that clicking does not
        thrash candidate list visibility. A similar test will be added in the future for the WK1 case in CandidateTests.

        AX: iOS Voiceover does not announce previously selected value from input type="date" form field
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164176

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Input type date is a popup button on iOS and its value was not exposed in stringValue() since
        it's not considered a text control. Instead, the value was exposed in AXTitle. Fixed this by adding
        the case in stringValue() and removing the AXTitle exposure.

               media/video-multiple-concurrent-playback.html

        Separate out the concept of "video-only" from "video-with-audio" in PlatformMediaSession::MediaType,
        and only set the ConcurrentPlaybackNotPermitted restriction for "video-with-audio".  This allows multiple
        silent video elements to play back simultaneously.

        However, the bug in question also shows bad behavior when both concurrent playback and invisible playback
        are not allowed. Namely, an invisible element will attempt to autoplay, interrupt visible elements, and
        then fail to play due to it's non-visibility.  Add an extra check to canTransitionFromAutoplayToPlay()
        which asks the session if autoplay is allowed (which will return false if the element is not visible).

        [WebIDL] Restructure IDLParser structs to better match modern WebIDL concepts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164208

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Restructure IDLParsers structs to match modern WebIDL conventions:
        - Rename structs to have more WebCore like naming, consistently using
          the prefix IDL.
        - Remove domSignature. Sinking it's properties into the structs that
          contained it.
        - Add IDLArgument, replacing the use of domSignatures for arguments.
          IDLArgument is the subset of domSignatures needed for arguments.
        - Rename domFunction to IDLOperation (matching WebILD nomenclature),
          replace signature with its own name, type (for returnType), specials,
          and extended attributes properties.
        - Give IDLAttribute it's own name, type and extended attributes properties.
        - Add IDLDictionaryMember, replacing the use of domSignature as the
          type of members in IDLDictionary. Give it name, type, isRequired,
          default and extendedAttributes properties.
        - Renamed Typedef to be IDLTypedef. Remove the extended attributes 
          property as those are not allowed in typedefs per-PebIDL.

        Also fix some parsing issues:
        - Stop parsing 'in' directives in function arguments.
        - Stop parsing extended attributes in typedefs.
        - Support applying typedefs to types deep in aggregate types
          (e.g. (sequence<(LONG or STRING)> or DOMString)?).

        [CSS Parser] Fix nth-child serialization

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Our nth-child serialization preserves what the author originally
        typed. Even though this is not spec-compliant (the latest CSS Syntax
        spec has a dumbed down serialization process that doesn't preserve what
        the author originally typed), I think it's better behavior to preserve
        this text.

        [Win][Direct2D] Correct bookkeeping for begin/end draw pairs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163898

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Simon pointed out that GraphicsContext objects are generally only created at
        the time we intend to do drawing, so calling 'BeginDraw' as part of object
        construction, and 'EndDraw' at time of destruction should be sufficient.

        As usual, he was correct.

        [DOM] Introduce WebCore::jsDynamicDowncast 
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164137 
 
        Reviewed by Darin Adler. 

        In WebCore, we have several extended JSTypes, like JSElementType. 
        For these types, WebCore offers the faster casting function compared 
        to JSC::jsDynamicCast. For example, for JSElementType, we have 
        jsElementCast. 

        The problem is that we may fall into the slow code if we choose 
        JSC::jsDynamicCast by accident. Selecting the appropriate function 
        requires special care in the IDL code generator when we would like 
        to use faster casting functions. 

        This patch implements a new casting function, WebCore::jsDynamicDowncast. 
        It is a thin wrapper to the JSC::jsDynamicCast. But it selects the 
        faster casting functions correctly by template specialization. 

        We do not choose the way specializing JSC::jsDynamicCast directly. 
        If we forget to include the header that specializes JSC::jsDyanmicCast, 
        it does not cause any compile errors, but it causes performance regression. 
        This bug is hard to figure out. To avoid this problem, we add a new function. 

        Outside JSC, only Tools' DumpRenderTree uses JSC::jsDynamicCast. 
        This code has FIXME that we should use JSC APIs instead of directly calling 
        JSC thingy. So this should be solved in the layer of JSC APIs and changing 
        this jsDynamicCast to WebCore's jsDynamicDowncast and exposing WebCore's thingy 
        are not good change. So we leave the code as is.

        (WebCore::XMLHttpRequest::setTimeout): If the XHR timeout is active, resetting the timeout to zero should lead to using the default network timeout. 
        Since it is difficult to update the timeout once the request is sent, we mimic the default network timeout with a 60 seconds XHR timeout. 
        (WebCore::XMLHttpRequest::createRequest): Setting network timeout to infinity if the XHR timeout is active.

        [DOMJIT] Implement Document::documentElement
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164113

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Test: js/dom/domjit-accessor-document-element.html

        This patch implements document.documentElement DOMJIT accessor.
        Similar to ownerDocument accessor, the way to access to document.documentElement
        from JIT code is already prepared for CSSJIT. DOMJIT just utilizes the existing
        functionality: using documentElementMemoryOffset().

        document.documentElement is frequently called in jQuery. Especially, every time
        we call jQuery.attr(), this is called.

        To implement Document accessor, we clean up some code in DOMJITHelpers.
        We create the cpp file for DOMJITHelpers and move some helpers to it.
        And we also implement DOMJIT::checkDOM<DOMInterface> for convenience.
        It returns appropriate CheckDOM patchpoint implementation.

        This patch improves Dromaeo jslib-attr-jquery.html 10% (481.64 v.s. 532.54).

        because the new parser does not generate WebKitCSSFilterValues,

        Wrong blur radius for filter: drop-shadow()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163667

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.
        
        The "stdDev" parameter to <feDropShadow> and <feGaussianBlur> represents the standard
        deviation (σ) of the Gaussian blur function. CSS filters drop-shadow() and blur() follow
        this with their radius parameter.
        
        However, CSS box-shadow and text-shadow use 2σ to describe the blur radius, since this
        is conveniently close to the number of pixels the effect of the blur extends out.
        
        feDropShadow, which is used by non-accelerated filter: drop-shadow(), was using
        the wrong blur radius because it passed its stdDev directly to ShadowBlur. ShadowBlur
        was written for CSS box-shadow, so expected its input "blur radius" to be twice the
        stdDev.

        On non-iOS platforms we were delaying issuing lower priority preload (images mostly) until document has body.
        This should be unnecessary as networking layer prioritization should ensure higher priority resources are
        loaded earlier. Testing on iOS has showed that more aggressive behavior is a win.

        This patch switches to iOS behavior on all platforms (and simplified the logic).

        [DOM] Add JSEventType
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164096

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Event is inherited by many Event classes. But, Event's accessors and interfaces are
        frequently called. For example, event.{type, target, srcElement} for accessors. And
        event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault() functions.

        However, since the user-visible event instance is typically the instance of the subclass,
        jsDynamicCast<JSEvent*>() walks several classes before it succeeds. It is costly.

        In this patch, we add a new WebCore JSType JSEventType for JSEvent and add a new
        function jsEventCast. That supports a super fast cast operation. And it paves the way
        for implementing DOM accessors of Event in DOMJIT.

        No behavior change.

        If an animation's keyframes affect stacking context properties, create stacking context while the animation is running
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164094

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The CSS animations spec <https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-1/> now makes it
        clear that a keyframe animation animating properties which can affect stacking context
        should establish stacking context while it's running, or filling-forwards. This is part
        of the "the user agent must act as if the will-change property...includes all the properties
        animated by the animation" clause.

        Implement by having CompositeAnimation::animate() track whether running animations should
        create stacking context, replacing existing code in AnimationController::updateAnimations()
        which only looked at opacity and transform. Transitions are also checked to see if they need
        to trigger stacking context.

        This allows for the removal of a 0.9999 hack when blending opacity.

        Support "insertFromDrop" and "deleteByDrag" for the InputEvent spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163948
        <rdar://problem/28921433>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Implements support for "insertFromDrop" and "deleteByDrag" inputTypes. These are fired when dragging and
        dropping text in editable areas. To do this, we introduce EditActionInsertFromDrop and EditActionDeleteByDrag
        (renamed from EditActionDrag, which is no longer necessary after this patch).

        When moving text from an editable element to another, we will use a DeleteSelectionCommand to delete the text
        from the source element and a ReplaceSelectionCommand to insert the text into the destination element. This
        means that we currently fire two input events on the source and destination elements (i.e. given by the start
        and end selections) after both child editing commands of the MoveSelectionCommand have been applied. Instead, we
        need to fire events in this order:

        1. beforeinput ("deleteByDrag") on the source
        2. Update DOM
        3. input ("deleteByDrag") on the source

        4. beforeinput ("insertFromDrop") on the destination
        5. Update DOM
        6. input ("insertFromDrop") on the destination

        To accomplish this, we allow an edit command to defer dispatching input events to its child commands via
        CompositeEditCommand::shouldDispatchInputEvents, which the MoveSelectionCommand overrides. Additionally,
        when applying the MoveSelectionCommand, we now apply() the child DeleteSelectionCommand and
        ReplaceSelectionCommand instead of using doApply(). This allows these children to separately dispatch input
        events, and also handle preventDefault() separately.

        commands along the way is null. In places where we used to ASSERT that command.composition() should be null, we
        now perform the assertion here instead.

        * editing/CompositeEditCommand.h:
        (WebCore::CompositeEditCommand::shouldDispatchInputEvents):

        This is true by default, which means that if apply() is called for a composite edit command that does not
        override this to return false, it will try to dispatch input events. In most cases, the parent command will call
        on the child command to doApply(), bypassing this check.

        Web Inspector: Include ConsoleAgent in Workers - real console.log support

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        Test: inspector/worker/console-basic.html

        This introduces a real ConsoleAgent in the Worker InspectorController.
        We no longer need to pass partial ConsoleMessage objects to be logged
        through the Page, we can just send the full ConsoleMessages to a
        frontend once it connects to the Worker.

        In order to guarantee that the Worker InspectorController is properly
        all Workers will start paused if there is an Inspector attached to
        the Page. The frontend _must_ call the new Worker.initialized method
        after sending its setup commands to the Worker. This ensures we get
        handle all initialization commands (like Agent.enable(), and
        setting state like breakpoints) before any script executes in the
        Worker. This mirrors the Inspector.initialized method that does the
        same thing for JSContext auto-attach of the Main target.

        In the backend, the wait until initialized state is just running
        the WorkerThread's RunLoop in a special debugger mode to only process
        debugger commands until we are ready. This will effectively be
        the same as pausing so it is generalized into WorkerThread.

        Web Inspector: Introduce Page WorkerAgent and Worker InspectorController

        Test: inspector/worker/worker-create-and-terminate.html

        From the perspective of an Inspector frontend, Workers are
        like a special JavaScript context, separate from the page, that
        may have its own set of Agents. This patch adds the necessary
        backend infrastructure to provide WorkerGlobalObject with an
        InspectorController and the means to communicate with a frontend
        through a Page's WorkerAgent.

        Pages now get a WorkerAgent. This informs the frontend about
        created and terminated Workers. It also provides a communication
        channel to dispatch and return inspector protocol messages to
        each of the Workers. The Page side always interacts with the
        WorkerInspectorProxy on the main thread. The Page's Worker Agent
        can sends and receives messages to WorkerInspectorControllers.

        WorkerGlobalScopes now get a WorkerInspectorController which
        will eventually contain its own set of agents. There are no
        agents yet, but they will be added individually in follow-up
        patches. The Worker side always interacts with the
        WorkerGlobalScope on the worker thread. WorkerInspectorController
        dispatches messages on its agents.

        All communication with Worker agents goes through Worker.sendMessageToWorker,
        which tunnels the command request to the Worker's InspectorController
        and agents. At the protocol level, worker agent command responses and
        worker agent events are sent as events through Worker.dispatchMessageFromWorker.
        On the frontend, the message dispatcher code will pair up replies with
        their commands, and no-reply messages as events, like normal. So calling
        worker agent methods in the frontend will be no different from the
        existing callback/promise-based ways.

        Prevent hit tests from being performed on an invalid render tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163877
        <rdar://problem/28675761>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Changeset r200971 added code to ensure that layout is up-to-date before hit testing, but did
        so only for the main frame. It was still possible to enter cross-frame hit testing with a
        subframe needing style recalc. In that situation, the subframe's updateLayout() would get
        called, which could trigger a compositing change that marked the parent frame as needing style
        recalc. A subsequent layout on the parent frame (for example by hit testing traversing into
        a second subframe) could then mutate the parent frame's layer tree while hit testing was
        traversing it.
        
        This patch modifies the hit test logic to ensure that a recursive layout is performed so that
        we always perform hit tests on a clean set of frames. It also adds some assertions to warn
        us if we encounter this invalid state.

        BufferSource should behave as an union
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164056

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        WebIDL typedefs BufferSource as (ArrayBufferView or ArrayBuffer).
        To follow that definition, IDLBufferSource is now type-aliased
        to IDLUnion<IDLInterface<ArrayBufferView>, IDLInterface<ArrayBuffer>>.

        Converter<IDLBufferSource> template specialization can now be
        removed since the default specialization for IDLUnion will be
        used.

        C++ implementations still work through a BufferSource object.
        That class now has an implicit constructor that consumes the
        Variant object. The data() and length() methods on the class
        now iterate the variant to find an existing object that can
        provide a pointer to the data or the length of it.

        [DOMJIT] Implement Node::ownerDocument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164004

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Test: js/dom/domjit-accessor-owner-document.html

        Implement Node.ownerDocument DOMJIT accessor.
        According to the result of the profiler, jQuery's prop()
        function is frequently called in Ember.js SpeedoMeter.
        And this function calls jQuery.isXMLDoc(). And this isXMLDoc()
        function calls element.ownerDocument accessor. And our WebKit
        inspector also uses ownerDocument accessor frequently.

        Interesting thing is this ownerDocument functionality is used
        in CSSJIT, so CSSJIT has similar helper function to look up the
        owner document of the element. As a result, all the necessary
        functionality is already implemented, DOMJIT just utilizes it.
        For example, Node::treeScopeMemoryOffset() and
        TreeScope::documentScopeMemoryOffset() is implemented before this
        patch.

        In the future, we will convert CSSJIT's Assembler& to CCallHelpers&
        and share the code with DOMJIT[1].

        Replace IDBKeyPath with a WTF::Variant
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163909

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Replace IDBKeyPath class with the IDBKeyPathVariant type entirely
        and rename IDBKeyPathVariant to IDBKeyPath.

        Unfortunately, IDBKeyPath still needs some special handling when
        returned to the JavaScript because we do not have a toJS() accepting
        a WTF::Variant as input yet.

        There should be no significant behavior change except that
        IDBIndex.keyPath / IDBObjectStore.keyPath now returns an array of
        Strings instead of a DOMStringList object when the IDBKeyPath
        contains a vector. This is a progression and matches the
        specification:

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162900

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Refactor MSE-specific logic to its own GStreamer player. This new MSE player coordinates
        data appending, media playback and interaction with MediaSource by delegating to
        AppendPipeline (one instance per SourceBuffer), PlaybackPipeline and
        MediaSourceClientGStreamerMSE/MediaSourcePrivateClient respectively.

        This patch is co-authored with Philippe Normand <philn@igalia.com> (EME support).

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        Under some circumstances, GStreamer deadlocks completely during MSE seeks on OpenGL ES
        systems. This is because the video sink still holds samples. Proper DRAIN support
        fixes this issue and is also good for all the platforms, not only OpenGL ES.

        REGRESSION (r178265): XSS Auditor fails to block document.write() of incomplete tag
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163978
        <rdar://problem/25962131>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        During the tokenization process of an HTML tag the start and end positions of each of its
        attributes is tracked so that the XSS Auditor can request a snippet around a suspected
        injected attribute. We need to take care to consider document.write() boundaries when
        tracking the start and end positions of each HTML tag and attribute so that the XSS Auditor
        receives the correct snippet. Following r178265 we no longer consider document.write()
        boundaries when tracking the start and end positions of attributes. So, the substring
        represented by the start and end positions of an attribute may correspond to some other
        attribute in the tag. Therefore the XSS Auditor may fail to block an injection because the
        snippet it requested may not be the snippet that it intended to request.

        Support InputEvent.dataTransfer for the InputEvent spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163213
        <rdar://problem/28700407>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Adds support for the dataTransfer attribute of InputEvent, which contains both HTML and plain text
        representations of inserted content corresponding to input types "insertFromPaste", "insertFromDrop" and
        "insertReplacementText". The specification calls for the data transfer's drag data item list to contain this
        information via two entries with type strings "text/html" and "text/plain". However, WebKit does not yet support
        the DataTransfer.items -- in lieu of this, we will provide this information for now via getData("text/plain")
        and getData("text/html"), respectively.

        To support this attribute, we need a special type of DataTransfer which is readonly and returns canned data
        given a type string. To implement this, we introduce StaticPasteboard, a type of Pasteboard which is initialized
        with a map of type string to data. When asked for its data via getData, the StaticPasteboard searches its map
        for the requested type and returns the result, if any.

        An editing command may now create a new DataTransfer via DataTransfer::createForInputEvent from HTML and
        plaintext strings, and then vend this information to its dispatched input events by overriding
        CompositeEditCommand::inputEventDataTransfer.

        Some further work will be needed to ensure that all information exposed via this DataTransfer does not contain
        hidden content. To do this, we should create a new Document, "paste" the contents of our copied HTML string into
        it, then simulate selecting the content and generating markup from the selection to create a sanitized
        DocumentFragment corresponding to the original copied HTML. This will be addressed in a future patch.

        CachedResourceLoader should set headers of the HTTP request prior checking for the cache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163103

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        No expected change of behavior.

        Moved referrer, user-agent, and origin headers setting to CachedResourceRequest/CachedResourceLoader before checking the cache.
        This allows simplifying vary header checks and is more inline with the fetch specification.

        To compute the referrer value, we need to know whether the request is cross-origin.
        A helper function isRequestCrossOrigin is added for that purpose and is also used in CachedResource to set its initial response tainting.

        We should disable setting user-agent and origin headers by FrameLoader for subresources since this is now done in CachedResourceLoader.
        This could be done as a follow-up patch.

        Custom elements reactions should have a queue per element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163878

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch splits the custom elements reaction queue into per element to match the latest HTML specifications:
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-element-reaction-queue
        and introduces the backup element queue:
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#backup-element-queue

        In terms of code changes, CustomElementReactionStack now holds onto ElementQueue, an ordered list of elements,
        and make each ElementRareData keep its own CustomElementReactionQueue. CustomElementReactionQueue is created
        for each custom element when it is synchronously constructed or enqueued to upgrade.

        Because each reaction queue is now specific to each element, CustomElementReactionQueue instead of
        CustomElementReactionQueueItem stores JSCustomElementInterface.

        The backup element queue is created as a singleton returned by CustomElementReactionStack's backupElementQueue,
        and ensureBackupQueue() schedules a new mirotask to process the backup queue when there isn't already one.

        ensureCurrentQueue() now returns a reference to CustomElementReactionQueue instead of a pointer since it can
        fallback to the backup queue when the stack is empty as specified:
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#enqueue-an-element-on-the-appropriate-element-queue

        Note that ensureCurrentQueue() may insert the same element multiple times into the element queue for now since
        avoiding this duplication would require either doing O(n) iteration on m_elements or adding a HashSet.
        We can revisit this in the future if the reaction queue is found to grow beyond a few entries since elements in
        the element queue will have duplicates only when each reaction queue has more than one item.

        <rdar://problem/28864380>

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        This patch does following few things:
        1. It updates the SubtleCrypto::generateKey method to match the latest spec:
           https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#SubtleCrypto-method-generateKey.
           It also refers to the latest Editor's Draft at a certain degree:
           https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html#SubtleCrypto-method-generateKey.
        2. It implements generateKey operations of following algorithms: AES-CBC, AES-KW,
           HMAC, RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5, RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5, and RSA-OAEP.
        3. It replaces SPECIALIZE_TYPE_TRAITS_CRYPTO_ALGORITHM_PARAMETERS with
        SPECIALIZE_TYPE_TRAITS_CRYPTO_ALGORITHM_PARAMETERS_DEPRECATED for deprecated params.
        4. It fixes https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129750 as well.

        CallDOMPatchpoint now has the way to tell its effects to DFG and FTL compilers.
        WebCore DOMJIT::AbstractHeapRepository will construct the hierarchy of the abstract

        [CodeGenerator] Only allow a single interface or standalone dictionary per WebIDL file
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163889

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Assert that there's only one interface or standalone dictionary
        per WebIDL input file, and exit from the generator otherwise.

        This avoids potential linking issues where multiple enumeration
        and dictionary bindings code can be generated if the source
        WebIDL for them is specified in a file that contains multiple
        interfaces or standalone dictionaries.

        Additionally, the generator now also exits if it fails to
        generate code for any interface of standalone dictionary. This
        should avoid processing WebIDL files that are empty in
        substance.

        TestException.idl and TestInterface.idl files have their second
        interfaces removed. In place of those a new testing IDL file is
        added, TestInterfaceLeadingUnderscore.idl. Like the two removed
        interfaces, it tests that the leading underscode in the
        identifier is removed by the generator.

        [CodeGeneratorJS] Support enums for standalone dictionaries

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        Add support for enumerations in WebIDL files that specify
        standalone dictionaries. Implementation of this is pretty
        straight-forward and mirrors interface and callback generators
        by calling GenerateEnumerations{Header,Implementation}Content()
        functions in GenerateDictionary{Header,Implementation}().

        In GenerateEnumerationsImplementationContent(), the
        NeverDestroyed.h header is added to the implementation includes
        since that class is used to hold an array of possible enum
        values.

        A test enum is added to the TestStandaloneDictionary.idl file
        and the baselines are updated to reflect the new capability.

        [CodeGeneratorJS] Standalone dictionaries have misplaced build guards
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163881

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Build guards that are generated from the Conditional attribute
        on WebIDL dictionary declarations properly guard the relevant
        convertDictionary() functions for WebIDL files that also specify
        interfaces. But for standalone dictionaries these build guards
        should guard the complete header and implementation files, much
        like this is done for files that originate from interfaces or
        callbacks.

        Before this patch, guarding a standalone dictionary resulted in
        malformed output because GenerateHeaderContentHeader() and
        GenerateImplementationContentHeader() functions both generated
        the #if macro that would guard the whole file, but
        GenerateDictionary{Header,Implementation}() didn't generate the
        closing #endif.

        CodeGeneratorJS.pm now passes the conditional string, if any,
        to GenerateDictionary{Header,Implementation}Content() functions
        in case of a non-standalone dictionary. Otherwise, the
        conditional string, if any, is used to guard the complete
        header and implementation files.

        Generator tests are updated to cover various build guard
        combinations on dictionaries in TestObj.idl, and the standalone
        dictionary WebIDL file now has a Conditional attribute to check
        that the build guards cover complete generated header and
        implementation files.

        [WebIDL] Add IDLType based toJS conversion
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163861

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Adds toJS<IDLType>() functions to be the new way of converting
        from implementation types to JS types. These are implemented via
        a similar mechanism to the convert<IDL>() functions, though specializations
        of a JSConverter struct (rather than the Converter structs). This allows
        us to support arbitrarily complex aggregate types easily (e.g. sequence<(Node or DOMString?)>).

        * Modules/geolocation/Geoposition.idl:
        * dom/Event.idl:
        Add typedef for DOMTimeStamp. Eventually, our IDLParser should do this for us, but
        for now it allows us to simplify the type system.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMConvert.h:
        (WebCore::toJS):
        Add 5 primary toJS functions which take combinations of the following
        arguments: ExecState, JSDOMGlobalObject, ThrowScope.  All take the value 
        to be converted as well, except in the case of the throwScope ones, where
        they take the value in an ExceptionOr<>.

        To simplify the implementations of the JSConverter specializations, avoiding
        the need for each one to implement their conversion up to 3 times (one for just
        the value, one for the value and the ExecState, and one for the value, the ExecState
        and the global object), each JSConverter instead specifies whether it's converter
        needs an ExecState or global object via a static constexpr. We then use the 
        JSConverterOverloader template, to call the correct function. This can probably be
        improved in the future, by inferring the number of arguments needed via SFINAE, but
        this seemed like a more straightforward first cut.

        In addition to checking whether the renderer needs layout, we also need to check if its preferred
        width is clean and stop computing the selection rects, if needed (while adding a renderer to the tree,
        there's a transition phase where the parent's preferred width dirty bit is already set, but it does
        not yet need layout).

        The CSS Units and Values spec states that font-relative units, when used
        in the font-size property, are resolved against the parent element. When
        calc() is specified, we were trying to resolve them against the current
        element, which is impossible because of the circular dependency. Instead,
        we should resolve against the parent style the same way as when calc() 
        isn't specified.

        Fix repainting of slow repaint objects in WK1 when page scale is applied
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163854

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.
        
        RenderObject::repaintSlowRepaintObject() always set the repaint container to the RenderView
        if it was null. This is before the call to clippedOverflowRectForRepaint(). If that function
        is called with a null repaintContainer, it maps the rect up through the RenderView's transform
        (which represents page scale), which is what we want here. Passing the RenderView itself
        stops the transform from being applied, which led to the bug.
        
        WebKit2 doesn't suffer from this bug because containerForRepaint() always returns the
        composited RenderView.

        WebPage should take UserActivity directly for user input
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163813

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        When we receive mouse/keyboard events in a page, we want to prevent AppNap. We currently do so
        via the PageThrottler. This patch is to just make the WebPage drive the UserActivity directly.

        Two reasons to do so: (1) to cleanup & simplify for further refactoring. (2) The current code
        isn't really achieving the desired effect. The page setting the flag in the throttler to get
        the activity to be set is now a less effective way of achieving this goal, since the
        PageActivityState bounces back across to the UI process & then messages back to the WebContent
        process to take the UserActivity. These extra hops defeat the purpose of making sure the boost
        from the initial message isn't lost.

        events are fired in the correct order with respect to each other, additional work will be required to ensure
        that input events are fired in the correct order with respect to composition(start|update|end) events and
        textInput events. This is held off until the expected ordering of events is officially defined in the spec.

        YouTube stalls when seeking beyond buffered range
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162813

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        When seeking a MediaPlayerPrivateMediaSourceAVFObjC, we will first seek the AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer,
        flush and enqueue non-displaying frames, enqueue regular frames, then begin playback. The above stall will occur
        when we enqueue so many non- displaying frames that the display layer is not ready for normal ones before
        playback begins. Then, when the synchronizer attempts to synchronize the enqueued audio and video renderers, the
        only available samples are back at the original media time, and so it "seeks" by updating the CMTimebase back to
        the original media time, causing playback to appear "stalled".  The overall solution is to "flush" the contents
        of the renderers before the seek, so that the synchronizer doesn't reset the currentTime, and to only restart
        the synchronizer when there are visible (or audible) samples available for display.

        Breaking the fix down into sections:

        = Don't enqueue too many non-displaying samples at once:
        - Rename SourceBufferPrivate::flushAndEnqueueNonDisplayingSamples() to SourceBufferPrivate::flush(), and no longer
          pass in an array of non-displaying samples.
        - Add a new virtual method to MediaSample, createNonDisplayingCopy(), used by SourceBuffer to enqueue non-displaying
          samples.
        - in SourceBuffer::reenqueueMediaForTime(), use that new createNonDisplayingCopy() method to enqueue non-displaying
          samples in the same queue as regular samples.

        [Web IDL] MediaControlsHost has invalid operation overloads
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163793

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        MediaControlsHost has invalid operation overloads:
        - sortedTrackListForMenu()
        - displayNameForTrack()

        The parameter is nullable for both overloads which is not valid IDL.

        - sortedTrackListForMenu(): The parameter is no longer nullable. This is a minor
          behavior change and it should be safe since this is Apple-specific and only
          called from mediaControlsApple.js which uses HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks and
          HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks as input, both of which are not nullable.
          Note that we could have also kept one of the parameters as nullable to not
          change behavior but allowing null does not seem useful here.
        - displayNameForTrack(): Use a union instead of overloading, no behavior change.

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Because m_sessions can be mutated by removeSession() while iterating over m_sessions, and because
        PlatformMediaSessions are not refcounted, it is not enough to copy m_sessions into a copied Vector
        before iterating. Instead, wrap iteration of m_sessions in a convenience function, which sets an
        iteration counter which, when cleared, removes all null entries from m_session. In parallel, modify
        removeSession() to check this iteration counter, and replace the session with a null value rather
        than mutating the m_sessions vector itself.

        Style resolver should be updated lazily

        When SourceBuffer receives a sample in sourceBufferPrivateDidReceiveSample() containing
        a trackID not previously seen in an initialization segment, it creates a default TrackBuffer
        object to contain that track's samples. One of the fields in TrackBuffer, description, is
        normally filled out when an initialization segment is received, but with this default
        TrackBuffer, it's still null when it's checked later in sourceBufferPrivateDidReceiveSample().

        Rather than adding a null-check on trackBuffer.description, drop any sample that has a 
        trackID which was not present during a previous initialization segment.

        Add isClosed() checks (which are effectively m_private null-checks) everywhere m_private is
        dereferenced. The one place where m_private is cleared without setting the state to closed
        is stop(), so make stop() set the state to closed as well (without firing any events).

        Stop keeping these around for cached pages to save lots of memory.
        We can easily rebuild them if a cached navigation occurs, and this
        way we also don't need to worry about invalidating style for cached
        pages in all the right places.

        Restoring a cached page will now lead to a forced style recalc.
        We don't try to defer this (beyond a zero-timer) since it's going
        to happen anyway, and it's nicer to front-load the cost rather than
        stuttering on the first user content interaction.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Created a Perl script to generate all IDL bindings for CMake.
        This script can regenerate outdated bindings by based on the

        add_custom_target is used to invoke the script instead of
        add_custom_command because Ninja deletes all output files before
        executing the command in case of add_custom_command.

        USES_TERMINAL option of add_custom_target has two effects:
        1) Not buffering output of the command
        2) Invoking the command in the special Ninja pool which inhibits parallel build
        One needs to use CMake 3.2 or later to enable this feature.

        [GTK] Avoid including egl.h headers in internal headers

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        egl.h includes eglplatform.h that decides the native types for the platform at compile time. However, we support
        to build with X11 and Wayland at the same time and decide what to use at runtime. Currently GLContext.h includes
        eglplatform.h after wayland-egl.h if Wayland is enabled. That means that the wayland native types are used by
        default from all cpp files including GLContext.h. It currently works in X11 because we cast the value anyway and
        for example EGLNativeWindowType is a pointer in Wayland that can be casted to unsigned long in X11 to represent
        the X Window. This is very fragile in any case, we should avoid adding egl headers in our headers and only
        include it in cpp files. But we also need to ensure we don't use X11 and Wayland in the same cpp file.

        Wrong use of EGL_DEPTH_SIZE
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155536

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        What happens here is that the driver doesn't implement EGL_DEPTH_SIZE and the default value, which is 0, is
        returned. Then XCreatePixmap fails because 0 is not a valid depth. The thing is that even if EGL_DEPTH_SIZE or
        EGL_BUFFER_SIZE returned a valid depth, it still might not be supported by the default screen and XCreatePixmap
        can fail. What we need to ensure is that the depth we pass is compatible with the X display, not only with the
        EGL config, to avoid failures when creating the pixmap. So, we can use EGL_NATIVE_VISUAL_ID instead, and
        then ask X for the visual info for that id. If it isn't found then we just return before creating the pixmap,
        but if the visual is found then we can be sure that the depth of the visual will not make the pixmap creation
        fail. However, with the driver I'm using it doesn't matter how we create the pixmap that eglCreatePixmapSurface
        always fails, again with X errors that are fatal by default. Since the driver is not free, I assume it doesn't
        support eglCreatePixmapSurface or it's just buggy, so the only option we have here is trap the x errors and
        ignore them. It turns out that the X errors are not fatal in this case, because eglCreatePixmapSurface ends up
        returning a surface, and since these are offscreen contexts, it doesn't really matter if they contain an
        invalid pixmap, because we never do swap buffer on them, so just ignoring the X errors fixes the crashes and
        makes everythig work. This patch adds a helper class XErrorTrapper that allows to trap XErrors and decide what
        to do with them (ignore, warn or crash) or even not consider a particular set of errors as errors.

        then rather than creating a pair, the new parser makes a singleton primitive value.

        [Modern Media Controls] Media Controller: click-to-start support

        <rdar://problem/28845656>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We introduce the MediaControllerSupport class which will allow a number of media controller
        features to be implemented by subclasses each devoted to implementing a specific subset of
        media controller features. With this bug, we add the correct behavior for click-to-start,
        only showing the start button under the right circumstances.

        A MediaController object indicates which media control to attach click event listeners to
        through the `control` property, and a list of media events it should register on the media
        element through the `mediaEvents` property. Then, as the user interacts with the specified
        control and the media, the Button delegation method `buttonWasClicked()` and the `syncControl()`
        methods are called to allow for the media state to be correctly set and represented in the
        media controls. Custom event handling for the specified events can also be achieved by
        subclassing the `handleEvent()` method.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The new parser turned function names into CSSValueIDs and made CSSFunctionValue store them. This
        meant it could be used to handle transform values, with the function name representing the
        transform operation efficiently as a CSSValueID.

        The old parser, however, creates WebKitCSSTransformValues. This value does not exist in the new
        parser. Rather than forcing the old and new parser over to CSSFunctionValues, I opted to
        just make the new parser build WebkitCSSTransformValues too.

        The main reason I did this is that WebkitCSSTransformValue is actually exposed to the Web via

        [CSS Parser] Fix named color parsing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163662

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Named color parsing in the old parser for extended colors relied on constructing a Color with the
        name and doing a lookup that way.

        The new parser allows the back end to hold a primitive identifier value for extended colors.

        StyleColor contains a helper function for looking up the correct color.

        This patch switches both the old and the new parsers over to the new StyleColor function.

        Also remove some asserts from the CSSSelectorList, since the new parser allows it to be empty and
        detects parsing failure that way.

        Web Inspector: Debugger buttons positioned incorrectly, align-content default value is unexpected
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163572

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        We only allow the new CSS Box Alignment syntax when the Grid Layout
        feature is enabled. Due to flexbox backward compatibility we have
        implemented a different code path for the style initial/default values
        assignment. However, we have incorrectly resolved both align-content
        and justify-content to 'flex-start' when grid layout is disabled.

        This patch changes the approach, so we set 'normal' (the value specified
        by the new syntax) for both properties, but using the values defined in
        the old syntax (Flexbox specification) at computed style resolution.

        Since 'stretch' is the default value for the align-content property, this
        issue implies that any flexbox line with an undefined height will be
        laid out incorrectly, if not explicitly set via CSS, because flex items
        can't use the available height, even though they use 'stretch' for their
        'align-self' properties.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Drop webkit-specific IDL extended attributes that are no longer useful:
        - [CustomReturn]: I believe this used to be for ObjC bindings. It has
          no impact in JS bindings.
        - [Deletable]: It only had an impact on static attributes and was only
          used on HTMLAllCollection.all, which is not static. I updated the
          bindings generator to so that static attributes are now configurable
          by default (unless marked as [Unforgeable], as per Web IDL [1]. This
          causes Notification.permission (This only static attribute we have)
          to become deletable. This behavior is consistent with the specification
          and with Chrome. I added test coverage for this.
        - [ImplementationNamespace]: Implemented but unused.
        - [PassContext]: Not implemented and unused.

        Modern media controls don't update their rendering correctly

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        There are rendering issues when we use an absolutely-positioned element
        as the top-most element in a media element's shadow root (webkit.org/b/163592).
        Since we only need for that element to be positioned, we can use "position: relative"
        instead, which removes the rendering issues.

        SVGCSSParser: m_implicitShorthand value is not reset after adding the shorthand property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116470

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When we encounter a shorthand css property, we set m_implicitShorthand
        to true to tell addProperty() later that the individual properties are
        all set through a short hand one. We need to make sure that setting 
        m_implicitShorthand to true will not be leaked after finishing parsing
        the short hand property.

        [WebIDL] Support BufferSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163541

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        Add support for the BufferSource typedef in WebIDL. The implementation
        adds the necessary handling for this type in the generator scripts and
        the specialization of the Converter<> template for the IDLBufferSource
        struct that enables exposing ArrayBuffer or ArrayBufferView objects by
        having WebCore::BufferSource objects pointing to their data.

        The SourceBuffer interface in the MSE module has the appendBuffer()
        operation modified to accept a BufferSource parameter, instead of
        overloading it for ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView parameters.

        The bindings generator tests cover BufferSource as both an operation
        parameter and as a dictionary member.

        [css-grid] Different width of grid container between initial load and refresh
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163535

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        Grid's layout logic manages two different override sizes; one it's
        designed to implement the grid item's stretching behavior, identified
        with the concept of 'overrideContentLogicalSize'; there is another
        override size, known as overrideContainingBlockContentLogicalSize,
        used to implement the Grid Area abstraction, which will behave as
        the actual containing block of any grid item.

        During grid's layout logic these override sizes are set according
        to the CSS style rules. This affects how the grid container and its
        children are going to be sized during layout. Grid Tracks sizing
        algorithm depends on these override sizes.

        In order to ensure that the tracks sizing algorithm produces the
        same results when it's run consecutively several times, we need to
        clear these override sizes and perform a layout of the affected grid
        items. Otherwise, the affected items will return sizing values which
        depend on the override values set in the previous layout, which in
        some cases, like orthogonal flows, may change through different runs
        of the sizing algorithm.

        [css-grid] Constrain by min|max-height on auto repeat computation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163540

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The max-height (if definite) is used to compute the number of auto repeat rows whenever the
        height is indefinite. We were using the min-height only in case both values were indefinite.

        Although not explicitly mentioned by grid specs, it's reasonable to assume that
        the min-height trumps the used value of height/max-height like it always does, per CSS
        2.2. Note that the number of rows still needs to fit within that size even if using
        min-height, because we're just using min-height to compute the used value of the height
        property. If both height and max-height are indefinite we keep doing the same, i.e., compute
        the minimum number of rows that fulfill min-height (if definite).

        We add a new main.js file which acts as the entry point by implementing the createControls()
        function that HTMLMediaElement::ensureMediaControlsInjectedScript() once the shadow root has

        the controller object that will handle communication between the media controls and the media
        element. At first, this MediaController class is very limited and assumes macOS inline
        layout traits and forces a start button to be shown over the media, which can be played
        to start the media and show the full controls. More functionality will be added by future patches.

        As per the NSEvent documentation [1], calling [NSEvent characters] is only
        valid on key up / key down events and will raise an NSInternalInconsistencyException
        if accessed on any other kind of event object. The crash happens when keyForKeyEvent()
        is called with the third kind of key event (NSFlagsChanged) which is used for
        detecting modifier keys. We normally detect the modifier key and return early before
        calling [NSEvent characters]. However, in some rare cases, we fail to detect the
        modifier key and we fall through.

        To address the issue, we now return "Unidentified" for NSFlagsChanged events, if we
        fail to detect the modifier key and before calling [NSEvent characters].

        Delete the animated image catchup code
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163410

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch fixes two issues in the animated image workflow:

        1) Setting the animation timer should follow the following rules:
        
            -- Initial case: Which happens before drawing the first frame. We
            should set the timer to fire after the current_frame_duration.

            -- Late case (Slow animation): This happens if the current_time is
            past the next_frame_desired_time. In this case we should fire the
            timer immediately.

            -- Early case (Fast animation): This happens when there is still time
            before the next_frame_desired_time. In this case we should set the
            timer to fire after the difference between the next_frame_desired_time
            and the current_time.

        2) Deleting the code for catching up the current_frame:
        
            This code used to run in the slow animation case. It was never used
            on iOS. It was trying to adjust the current_frame according to the
            current_time as if there were no delay. It turned out that this might
            cause a bigger delay because most likely the decoder decodes the image
            frames incrementally; i.e. to decode frame k, it has to have frame
            (k - 1) decoded.

        Start fleshing out union support, starting with MessageEvent.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::reportValidity):
        Add implementation for reportValidity() for form control elements.
        First, it calls checkValidity() and returns early if there is no
        constraint violation. if the JS canceled the 'invalid' event
        fired by checkValidity(), then return early as well, as per the
        specification. If the element is focusable, we scroll to it,
        focus it and show the validation message. Otherwise, we log a
        error message to the console. The last part of the behavior
        matches what we already did in HTMLFormElement::validateInteractively()
        and complies with the behavior in the specification.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::focusAndShowValidationMessage):
        Add utility function to scroll to the form control element, focus
        it and show its validation message. This code was moved from

        (WebCore::HTMLFormElement::prepareForSubmission):
        Only call validateInteractively() if we really should validate. Those checks
        used to be in validateInteractively() but I moved them here so we could more

        Update Vector type to be a Vector of HTMLFormControlElement given that we

        The site has a keyframe animation on body. Currently this causes the animation to invalidate the
        style of the entire document.

        Animations use SyntheticStyleChange to invalidate elements when animation progresses and currently
        that causes full subtree invalidation. However animation only ever affect individual elements and
        the normal style resolution mechanism should be able to deal with things like inheritance as needed.

        even if those media elements had no audible audio, which was unfortunate.

        [Cairo] GraphicsContext3D::ImageExtractor fails to extract images
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163439

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        In the Cairo implementation of GraphicsContext3D::ImageExtractor,
        don't check for frame completeness at index 0. This information
        is now cached only after the frame for that index is decoded and
        marked as completed, which is done after this check.

        Becuase of this the current check forces extractImage() to return
        early and abort WebGL texture uploads from image sources.

        We introduce the TimeControl and TimeLabel classes. A TimeControl object
        provides two TimeLabels, one for the elapsed time, one for the remaining
        time, and a Scrubber in between them. Depending on a TimeControl's width,
        it will adjust its layout such that the scrubber takes all the available
        space between the labels, and can indicate whether it's large enough to
        meet the minimal required width to show the scrubber, such that a container
        node may decide not to show the TimeControl at all.

        TimeLabel nodes simply show an integer time value in miliseconds in a
        nicely formatted way.

        Support scoped style for user agent shadow trees

        <rdar://problem/28715318>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa and Andreas Kling.

        This patch adds support for user agent shadow trees that have scoped style. This means
        that the shadows can be styled via <style> elements contained in the tree instead of
        using pseudo elements on the global UA sheet. Since the style is scoped it can use
        normal id and class selectors.

        Elements in the shadow tree can still be exposed for author styling if needed by giving
        them pseudo ids

        The patch also uses the new mechanism for the <meter> element.

        The mechanism is not optimized yet, each shadow tree gets its own copy of style-related data
        structures. This can be improved later.

        [DOMJIT][JSC] Explore the way to embed nodeType into JSC::JSType in WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163245

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Node.nodeType accessor is so frequently called. For example, jQuery's $ function uses
        this to distinguish DOM objects from the other JS objects. So every time you call `$(dom)`,
        nodeType accessor is called. In addition to that, jQuery's prev, next, parent etc. also uses
        this `nodeType`. And Ember.js also uses it. And ... So this function is super critical for DOM
        performance.

        The challenge is that there is no room for putting NodeType into C++ Node class. Node class
        has a 32bit field to store some data. However, these bits are already exhausted. Extending
        Node class is unacceptable since it significantly enlarges memory consumption of WebKit (Node
        is everywhere!). Unfortunately, current Node::nodeType is implemented as a virtual function
        even though this function is frequently called from JS world.

        Interestingly, we already store some duplicate data in JSObject, JSC::JSType. WebCore already
        extends it with JSElementType, JSNodeType, and JSDocumentWrapperType. And these types are
        corresponding to specific NodeTypes. For example, JSElementType should have ELEMENT_NODE type.

        This patch further extends this JSC::JSType in WebCore side safely. We embed NodeType bits into
        JSC::JSType. This design offers significantly faster nodeType implementation. Furthermore, it
        makes DOMJIT easy for nodeType accessor.

        Even without the IC change[1], Dromaeo dom-query shows 8 - 10% improvement,
        1452.96 runs/s vs 1578.56 runs/s. We can expect that this improvement will be applied to the
        other benchmarks / real applications when the IC change is landed.

        Currently, we clear out Now Playing info whenever we set the visibility of Now Playing controls to Never. This
        is incorrect, as the Now Playing session needs to still be active (just not visible) in this state. Instead, we
        should not be taking the active/foregrounded-ness of a media session for Now Playing into account in
        MediaElementSession::canShowControlsManager so that even if a media session is in the active/foreground tab, we
        will update the Now Playing session with the latest info. However, when setting the visibility, we now check
        and see if the session allows Now Playing visibility, and set the Now Playing visibility to Always or Never
        depending on the answer.

        Refactor LineLayoutState's float box handling.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163286

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.
        
        We keep track of float boxes both per line (RootInlineBox::m_floats) and
        per flow block (LineLayoutState::m_floats) during layout.
        As we lay out the lines and iterate through RootInlineBox::m_floats, we
        increment LineLayoutState::m_floatIndex. This LineLayoutState::m_floatIndex is
        later used to find the matching float box in the per-block-flow float list.
        This logic works fine as long as the lists and the index manipulation are tightly coded.
        However due to the complexity of the line/float layout code, this is no longer the case.

        This patch makes float box handling more secure by changing this index based setup
        to a list iterator. It helps to eliminate potential vector overflow issues.

        LineLayoutState::FloatList (new class) keeps track of all the floats for the block flow.
        It groups the float box related functions/members and provides an iterator interface to ensure safer
        syncing between this and the line based floats.

        No change in functionality.

        Refactor binding generated casted-this checks for methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163198

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Covered by existing tests and binding rebased tests..

        Introducing BindingCaller::callMethod and callPromiseMethod to encapsulate casted-this checks for methods.
        This is supported for all methods except seralizer and iterators methods.

        Introduced castForMethod similarly to castForAttribute.
        Moved this from static methods of JSClass to static methods of BindingCaller<JSClass>
        This allows removing the corresponding declarations from JSClass header file.

        Note the difference of handling thisValue between the two in case of CustomProxyToJSObject.
        This should be made more consistent.

        In case of bad casted this check, CustomProxyToJSObject objects will throw a TypeError with an error message like other methods.
        Before the patch, a TypeError without error message was thrown.

        EventTarget being different, added a specialization of BindingCaller for it.
        This allows also removing some binding generated code dedicated to EventTarget.
        A similar approach might also be done for CustomProxyToJSObject objects to further simplify the binding generator.

        [CG] Add the option to immediately decode an image frame and control its memory caching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163298

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch fixes two things. (1) An option is added to immediately decode an
        image frame. This can be done by adding kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately
        to the ImageSource options dictionary. (2) BitmapImage should also control
        when the image frame is actually deleted from memory. This can be done by
        calling CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(). CG does not keep a reference
        to the returned CGImageRef.

        * platform/graphics/ImageFrame.h: Adding the DecodingMode enum class.
        Ideally this should be a member of ImageDecoder class. But since we

        select.options may return too many option elements. We're only supposed
        to return the option element children of the select element, and the
        option element children of all the optgroup element children of the

        - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-select-option-list

        Firefox and Chrome agrees with the specification. However, WebKit was
        returning all the option elements that are descendants of the select
        element.

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        Based on discussion in https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/150
        If that discussion decides to keep the spec as-is (which keeps non-ASCII characters in the fragment
        to match IE and Edge's behavior, which Chrome has followed for special schemes) then we can revert
        this change later after enabling the URL parser.  Making this change keeps behavior matching Safari
        and Firefox, as well as Chrome's handling of non-special schemes, such as data URLs.

        [Modern Media Controls] Buttons container

        <rdar://problem/28701864>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We add a new ButtonsContainer class which contains a group of Button objects
        and positions them based on the provided padding and margin between buttons.
        Buttons that aren't enabled or marked as dropped are not added to the tree of
        LayoutNodes, and thus the DOM.

        Additionally, we fix a few issues we found while working on tests for ButtonsContainer
        where LayoutNodes would schedule layout callbacks even when they would not do any work
        during the layout callback due to not resetting the `needsLayout` flag to false and
        removing any scheduled tasks when a layout was completed.

        Finally, we fix a few style issues that had not been caught so far and an unused
        `size` property on IconButton.

        WebRTC: Make MediaEndpointPeerConnection handle remotely assigned mids correctly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163202

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        An RTCRtpTransceiver has a null mid until it's been associated with a
        media description (with a mid) [1]. During that time, it's identified by
        a provisional mid that might become its real mid, but the transceiver
        can also get its mid assigned by a remote media description. In the
        second case, the mid value is initially unknown. A transceiver's
        RTCRtpSender must directly (synchronously in the script) provide a muted
        remote source that is playable by, for example, a media element. This
        source is initially registered in the MediaEndpoint (WebRTC backend)
        with the transceiver's provisional mid. So, if the real mid is set by a
        remote description, the registered mid must be updated to preserve the
        association between the registered source and the transceiver.

        [Modern Media Controls] Buttons

        We introduce specific IconButton subclasses for the various buttons we will be using
        in media controls on macOS (inline and fullscreen) and iOS. One class, StartButton, is
        a subclass of Button and not IconButton because we're only interested in having it display
        an <img> element rather than use a mask and requires additional DOM structure.

        [DOMJIT] Implement Node accessors in DOMJIT
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163005

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch implements DOMJIT accessors in WebCore. We plan to offer 2 things in DOMJIT.

            1. Hand written DOM inlining.

            We inject DOMJIT::Patchpoint compiler into JSC. And JSC uses this to inline DOM operation,
            and drop type checks. Since the operation is fully inlined, potentially it has large
            performance boost. Note that CSS Selector JIT compiler already does the similar things:
            accessing parentNode etc. directly by using offsets.

            2. Exposing signature information.

            We will offer function type signature by some representation and pass it to JSC.
            JSC will use to drop type checks. Since IDL code generator already knows this,
            we can automatically generate such a information. Since we don't perform any inlining,
            the performance boost may be limited. But it's worth doing.

        This patch implements the first one, hand written DOM inlining facility. We add a new IDL attribute,
        "DOMJIT". This means that "This readonly attribute have a DOMJIT patchpoint compiler".
        We annotate several accessors at first. "firstChild", "lastChild", "nextSibling", "previousSibling",
        and "parentNode". And we implement DOMJIT::Patchpoint for that in JSNodeDOMJIT.cpp.

        This patchpoint will be integrated into JSC's DFG and FTL. And these tiers can drop type checks and
        inline the entire code of these accessors. JSC compiler still does not know much about DOM. And WebCore
        does not know much about each tier of JSC. WebCore just offers the generic patchpoints and they are
        used in both DFG and FTL tiers. The layer separation is still kept.

        While very small microbenchmark[1] shows performance benefit, still we cannot improve DOM
        benchmarks due to the lack of following implementations. Once the following implementations
        are implemented, we will get performance boost.

        1. Super polymorphic sites.

            This inlining is super effective if we run some microbenchmarks. However, Dromaeo does not
            show so much performance benefit. This is because Dromaeo's dom-traverse.html is super
            polymorphic call site where JSC gives up optimization. For example, in the following
            dromaeo's benchmark, we can see so various DOM nodes at the `cur.firstChild` site, like,
            HTMLDivElement, HTMLAnchorElement, Text, Comment etc. JSC gives up optimization since we
            encounter so many Structures. This should be optimized since they share the large part of
            prototype-chain and they hit the exactly same CustomGetter, Node.prototype.firstChild.
            We will handle this and when we optimize it, this DOMJIT works well on Dromaeo.

                test( "firstChild", function(){
                    var nodes = document.body.childNodes, nl = nodes.length;

                    for ( var i = 0; i < num; i++ ) {
                        for ( var j = 0; j < nl; j++ ) {
                            var cur = nodes[j];
                            while ( cur )
                                cur = cur.firstChild;
                            ret = cur;
                        }
                    }
                });

        2. Emit code in IC.

            Currently, we only optimize DOMJIT accessors in DFG and FTL. However, we should leverage
            this DOMJIT::Patchpoint to emit inlined code even in Inline Caching (IC). We will emit
            CheckDOM's code for IC's guard phase, and emit CallDOM's code for IC's get phase. This
            offers performance benefit even if we live in baseline JIT code. And this should be easy.

        [1]: With the following one, we can see 3x improvement (26ms v.s. 80ms).

            var element = document.getElementsByTagName('div')[3];
            var before = Date.now();
            for (var i = 0; i < 1e7; ++i)
                element.firstChild;
            console.log(Date.now() - before);

        Support InputEvent.data for the new InputEvent spec

        <rdar://problem/28681935>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Introduces InputEvent.data, a string attribute that, if non-null, indicates the text to be inserted by an input
        event. For text areas and text inputs, the 'insertText', 'insertFromPaste', 'insertFromDrop', and
        'insertReplacementText' input types should cause subsequent `input` and `beforeinput` events to have non-null
        data. However, for contenteditable areas, only 'insertText' leads to having data in resulting InputEvents.

        To implement this, we introduce a new virtual method, CompositeEditCommand::inputEventData, which gives
        composite editing commands the chance to vend a data string for input events they might fire (by default, this
        is null).

        (to be added in a future patch along with composition support). While adding support for the data attribute, we
        tweak the InputEvent IDL and headers slightly to adjust for this.

        Address flaky airplay-* LayouTests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163044

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Two separate problems conspired to make airplay tests a bit flaky:

        For one, when the HTMLMediaElement clears its MediaPlayer, it won't necessarily notify
        clients that it has stopped playing to a wireless target. The WebMediaSessionManager may
        eventually cause this value to reset, but it's asynchronous, and may fire after the next
        test starts. Reset this state explicitly.

        For two, the state of the mock playback target picker was not being reset between test
        invocations.

        This allows handling reloading of resources with different redirection mode in canUpdateFromResource.

        ENABLE_LEGACY_ENCRYPTED_MEDIA interfaces should have a hard-coded WebKit prefix

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        Have the Web-exposed interfaces guarded by ENABLE_LEGACY_ENCRYPTED_MEDIA also use
        the WebKit prefix in the implementations. This will prevent conflicts between
        interfaces with same names in both the legacy API and the future EME API.

        Most of the interfaces in this legacy API already used the WebKit prefix when
        exposed via JS bindings. The only exception is MediaKeyNeededEvent, which gets
        prefixed in this patch.

        The interface implementations for this legacy API are also moved under the

        Support InputEvent.inputType for the new InputEvent spec
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163025
        <rdar://problem/28658092>

        Adds support for the inputType attribute of InputEvent. To do this, we introduce a helper to
        map EditActions to inputType names, and also split out ambiguous EditActions (such as
        EditActionTyping) into more specific subtypes (such as EditActionTypingDeleteBackward,
        EditActionTypingInsertParagraph, etc.), each of which corresponds to an inputType.

        In places where we create CompositeEditCommands, we now pass in these specific EditActions
        where appropriate, and when dispatching `beforeinput` and `input` events, we ask the
        CompositeEditCommand for its input type name, which it derives from its editingAction.

        The bug was caused by Document::invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCaches removing all node lists regardless

        Fixed the bug by removing only those node lists that got invalidated via LiveNodeList::invalidateCache.

        [CMake] CMake does not support the dep files for implicit dependency
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161433

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Created a Perl script to generate all IDL bindings for CMake.
        This script can regenerate outdated bindings by based on the
        supplemental dependency and dep files created by
        '--write-dependencies' switch of generate-bindings.pl.

        add_custom_target is used to invoke the script instead of
        add_custom_command because Ninja deletes all output files before
        executing the command in case of add_custom_command.

        USES_TERMINAL option of add_custom_target has two effects:
        1) Not buffering output of the command
        2) Invoking the command in the special Ninja pool which inhibits parallel build
        One needs to use CMake 3.2 or later to enable this feature.

        * CMakeLists.txt: Specified target names for

        [Mac] Write WebArchive to the pasteboard when copying image in WebKit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163100

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Write WebArchive to the pasteboard when copying image in WebKit. This
        fixes pasting such images to a content editable field in WebKit because
        Web archives take priority over RTFD when reading from the pasteboard
        in WebKit.

        Using RTFD when pasting the image in WebKit was causing issues because:
        1. The pasted image would not be displayed because our RTFD import code
           is buggy.
        2. The pasted image URL was a webkit-fake-url://
        3. Formatting associated to the image (e.g. inline style) would be lost

        No new tests, unskipped existing test on WebKit2.

        Update CustomEvent to stop using legacy [ConstructorTemplate=Event]
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163174

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Update CustomEvent to stop using legacy [ConstructorTemplate=Event] and
        use an actual constructor instead, like in the specification:
        - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-customevent

        There is a very minor behavior change when explictly passing undefined
        as detail value in CustomEventInit. We used to initialize detail to
        undefined but we now initialize it to null instead, which is its default
        value. The new behavior matches the one of Chrome and Firefox.

        Refactor binding generated casted-this checks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162677

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        No change of behavior.

        Split the attribute getter function in two, one with the signature expected by JSCore and one used after casted-this checks.

        The second function takes directly a JSXX object and returns a JSValue instead of an EncodedJSValue.
        In the future, the second function should only take references.

        Introducing BindingCaller as a way to templatize binding code used to cast thisValue with the desired JSXX value.
        This allows implementing the first function using the second function as template parameter.

        Introducing JSClass::castForAttribute as a way to encapsulate differences in the way to handle thisValue access.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Fix a bug where WK2 didRemoveFrameFromHierarchy callbacks wouldn't fire for subframes that were getting
        kicked out of PageCache. The problem was happening because CachedFrame would disconnect the Frame from
        its Page just before calling FrameLoader::detachViewsAndDocumentLoader() where the callbacks are fired.
        Without a Page, the WebFrame on WK2 side can't find its WebPage, and so it can't fire its callbacks.

        The fix is just to switch the order of those two lines.

        This bug was causing frequent DOM and window object leaks in some clients *cough* Safari *cough* that

        Making CachedResourceClient and CachedRawResourceClient callbacks take CachedResource references and not pointers.

        The function WebCore::contentDispositionType() was only used by the Chromium and Qt ports

        Upgrading and constructing element should always report exception instead of rethrowing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162996

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The latest HTML specification specifies that we must report exceptions thrown during element upgrades:
        https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#upgrades

        In addition, F2F during 2016 TPAC had a consensus that we should do the same for document.createElement:
        https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/569

        Since the HTML parser already reports the exception thrown during custom element construction as it does
        not have any JS stack, these changes make exceptions thrown during upgrades and constructions.

        In our implementation, this only reduces the code complexity as now we can push the logic to fallback
        to HTMLUnknownElement into JSCustomElementInterface's constructElement, which has been renamed
        to constructElementWithFallback, and eliminate ShouldClearException enum class entirely. Moreover,
        constructElementWithFallback can now return Ref instead of RefPtr.

        No new tests. Existing tests have been updated.

        Modify PlatformAppleWin.cmake to conditionally build the CoreGraphics
        and CoreAnimation implementation, or the Direct2D files, depending
        on whether the USE_DIRECT2D macro is set in the CMake build options.
        By default it builds the normal CA/CG way.

        Add a stub GraphicsLayer implementation for Direct2D.

        No new tests because there is no change in our active ports.

        WebRTC: Add support for the iceconnectionstatechange event in MediaEndpointPeerConnection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162961

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Implement MediaEndpointPeerConnection's iceTransportStateChanged callback. When called, it
        updates the ICE transport state of the corresponding transceiver and determines if the
        RTCPeerConnection's aggregated iceConnectionState needs to be updated.

        Update MediaEndpointMock's emulatePlatformEvent feature to support a new action:
        "step-ice-transport-states". When initiated, this action replays a predefined set of ICE
        transport state changes on a set of transceivers which can be observed via the
        iceTransportStateChanged (mentioned above).

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        When GStreamer-GL is enabled the GL context needs to be properly passed
        to the GStreamer pipeline running within the OpenWebRTC video renderer.
        This is now supported using a new OpenWebRTC API that allows the
        renderer to request the context from the application using a callback
        registered within the renderer.

        The player's GL context/display set-up was refactored to a new
        method, requestGLContext, which is used as callback for the
        OpenWebRTC request_context handler.

        [Modern Media Controls] Icon service and the IconButton class
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162970
        <rdar://problem/28631803>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We introduce the new IconButton class to display buttons that show an icon
        in modern media controls. An IconButton uses a CSS mask-image to display the icon
        such that we may set the actual button color to any value by setting the element's
        background-color property.

        Icons are obtained through the `iconService` singleton which knows how to load the
        right icon for the current layout traits and resolution. Icons loaded through the
        icon service are cached. In a later patch, we will be introducing functionality,
        through the MediaControlsHost, to load the icon from the WebCore bundle.

        This allows in particular to handle more clearly the case of data URLs which are allowed in all modes for regular requests.
        But they are not allowed for same-origin redirected requests.

        [Fetch API] Use ReadableStream pull to transfer binary data to stream when application needs it
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162892

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Covered by existing tests.

        Before this patch, FetchResponse was never resolving the start promise.
        This way, it could enqueue data, error or close the stream whenever desired.

        With this patch, FetchResponse will feed the stream when being asked to.
        This allows keeping the data in WebCore until the application needs it.
        This is only implemented for network data.
        For other data owned by response (blob, text...), data will be enqueued like previously as fast as possible.

        Note that FetchResponse can enqueue/error/close the stream at any time since JSFetchResponse has a reference to the stream.
        And the stream has a reference to the controller.

        In addition to transfer binary chunks to ReadableStream only when needed, WebCore is now aware of the data
        stored in the response, which may allow applying backpressure to the network source in the future.

        WebRTC: Add support for the icecandidate event in MediaEndpointPeerConnection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162957

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Implement MediaEndpointPeerConnection's gotIceCandidate and doneGatheringCandidates
        callbacks. These are used by the MediaEndpoint (WebRTC backend implementation) to
        notify about ICE events.

        Add API to Internals to emulate WebRTC platform events, such as dispatching a set of ICE
        candidates followed by a gathering done indication. Initially, only a single action,
        "dispatch-fake-ice-candidates", is supported, but the intention is to extend the set of
        actions to support more test cases.

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        In WebKit1, the top web area setting the selection to an input element inside an iframe
        will make the input field not editable. The issue is that when the web area and the input element
        have different documents, the setSelection function in FrameSelection will set the selection on
        the input's frame and cause the caret to disappear. I fixed it by not setting the selection in such case.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Currently the Direct2D implementation does not support some of the accelerated compositing
        features that require CoreAnimation. During this bring-up, we want to disable these routines
        so that we can build and run in (mostly) unaccelerated drawing.

        This patch mostly consists of adding "#if USE(CG)" and "#if USE(CA)" to files that are
        specific to those implementations.

        This change should have no impact on non-Direct2D ports.

        Missing quotation mark when <q> gets reparented.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162940

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When an opening RenderQuote gets removed due to some change in the render tree,
        we notify the closing RenderQuote so that it can update its content (") accordingly (and vice versa).
        However when the same RenderQuote is added back to the render tree (aka reparenting), we fail to
        let the other RenderQuote know about it and its content becomes stale.  
        This patch ensures that when either the opening or closing part of the quotation mark gets reparented,
        we inform the other, corresponding opening/closing renderer about it.

        Bindings should throw a TypeError if a required dictionary member is missing.
        For example, if there is a "required long id" member in a dictionary that is

        of throwing a TypeError.

        [ListItems] Render tree should be all clean by the end of FrameView::layout().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162832

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        List item markers are inserted into the tree during layout, right before laying out
        the list item (that's a big FIXME). At this point we already know what part of the tree
        needs to be laid out. Inserting a list item marker does not expand this dirty area.
        However whenever we insert a new renderer into the tree, we call setNeedsLayout on the contining block chain.
        In certain cases (floating renderers), it could potentially trigger some unintentional markings
        and we return from FrameView::layout() with a dirty subtree.

        This patch preemptively marks the list item and its marker dirty so that
        when the marker is getting inserted into the tree, we stop the marking at the parent.

        Not testable.

        Because the heavy lifting for font-variation-settings is done by CoreText, 
        this patch is fairly minimal. It simply hooks up the CSS property to CoreText. 

        There is an existing bug in CoreText where variations inside fonts do not 
        survive the addition of a cascade list. Therefore, FontPlatformData::ctFont() 
        needs to work around this (conditionally) by resupplying the variation at

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We introduce the new Button class and its parent class LayoutItem. We will subclass Button
        a lot in coming patches, as it provides a way to create a button and provide a delegate to
        respond to UI events via the `uiDelegate` property. A Button extends a LayoutItem, another
        class that we'll subclass heavily in coming patches, which is simply a LayoutNode with a
        `layoutDelegate` which allows to set the node's `layoutTraits`, a bit-mask allowing to
        specify layout attributes such as the platform and playback styles.

        ASSERTION FAILED: url.containsOnlyASCII() in WebCore::checkEncodedString() when parsing an invalid CSS cursor URL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162763
        <rdar://problem/28572758>

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        CSSCursorImageValue copies the URL of its underlying CSSImageValue by using the
        ParsedURLString URL constructor on the String returned by CSSImageValue::url(). While
        CSSImageValues were always being constructed from a URL implicitly converted to a String,
        nothing ensured that the URL was valid. For invalid URLs, URL::string() returns the string
        it was constructed with, which might still represent a relative URL or contain non-ASCII
        characters, violating the preconditions of the ParsedURLString URL constructor and causing
        an assertion to fail in Debug builds.

        Fix this by having CSSImageValue store its image URL using a WebCore::URL rather than a
        String. CSSCursorImageValue can then copy this URL instead of attempting to re-parse a
        possibly-invalid URL string.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        We have this feature behind ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE flag, which is confusing, because we use credential
        storage unconditionally and this is only about persistent storage. Also the flag assumes libsecret is available,
        and since it's only used by GTK sometimes we use GTK ifdefs instead of CREDENTIAL_STORAGE. So, I think we should
        use USE(LIBSECRET) instead, and reduce a bit the ifdefs in common soup code. Another problem is that current
        implementation is always used, while it should depend on the current network storage session and never used in
        ephemeral sessions. This patch moves the code from CredentialBackingStore to NetworkStorageSessionSoup and

        Media controls for Soundcloud easily falls out of sync with what's actually playing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162843
        <rdar://problem/28176874>

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Currently, audio elements are subject to the same main content restrictions as video elements. This is
        problematic on sites where audio elements are really the main content, such as soundcloud. We need a different
        heuristic for determining whether audio elements such as these should be allowed to show playback controls.

        Furthermore, we currently forbid autoplaying audio from showing controls if it has user gesture restrictions
        (i.e. it started playing via script). This is, again, problematic on sites where audio elements are played one
        after another (such as on soundcloud). Even though a subsequent audio element may have been triggered via
        script, we might want still want to show controls for it if the user has explicitly triggered other elements on
        the page to begin playing. However, if the user has not gestured on any media in the page, we still should not
        show controls for audio elements that begin playing via script.

        Adds two new unit tests to TestWebKitAPI simulating audio playback behavior on soundcloud.

        Covered by rebased and existing tests.

        Ensuring non-HTTP redirection URLs are not followed at DocumentThreadableLoader level for fetch API only.
        This should be applied to all clients at some point, but there is still some uncertainty for data URLs.

        Did some refactoring to better separate the case of security checks in case of regular request or redirected request.
        This allows in particular to handle more clearly the case of data URLs which are allowed in all modes for regular requests.
        But they are not allowed for same-origin redirected requests.

        If a scrolling state tree node changed type (e.g. from sticky to fixed), we'd fail

        Because the heavy lifting for font-variation-settings is done by CoreText,
        this patch is fairly minimal. It simply hooks up the CSS property to CoreText.

        There is an existing bug in CoreText where variations inside fonts do not
        survive the addition of a cascade list. Therefore, FontPlatformData::ctFont()
        needs to work around this (conditionally) by resupplying the variation at
        the same time as the cascade list. The CoreText bug is <rdar://problem/28449441>.

        Modify CSSPropertyAnimation to understand FontVariationSettings objects and how
        to interpolate them.

        If two FontVariationSettings objects are unlike (meaning they specify different
        variation axes), for now the interpolation simply returns an empty object. This
        might change in the future, but for now, this is a reasonable place to start.

        Because CSSPropertyAnimation interacts with RenderStyles instead of

        [Modern Media Controls] layout nodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162799
        <rdar://problem/28569301>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Modern media controls will be using a tree of LayoutNode objects that commit to the DOM
        in coordinated `requestAnimationFrame()` calls to ensure all layouts are done in an efficient
        and coordinated manner. As a preamble, we introduced the `scheduler` singleton in
        https://webkit.org/b/162726 which is in charge of scheduling callbacks.

        A LayoutNode is created by providing an Element to its constructor, or an HTML string. Not
        providing a parameter creates a simple <div>.

        When we set a property on a LayoutNode, we call `markDirtyProperty(propertyName)` which keeps
        track of dirty properties in the `_dirtyProperties` set. When this set is non-empty, the node
        is marked as dirty and registered in the global `dirtyNodes` map, asking the shared scheduler
        that a layout is needed. When the layout is performed, all nodes in the `dirtyNodes` map are
        processed such that `commitProperty(propertyName)` is called to commit dirty properties for
        a given node to the DOM, and `layout()` is called to allow subclasses of LayoutNode to conduct
        custom layout logic that goes beyond committing a given property.

        Another reason why a node may be marked as dirty is when a DOM hierarchy change is needed. A
        host of DOM-like methods are exposed to allow flexible manipulations of nodes, with an extra
        `children` property which allows wholesale change of a node's subtree with a single array
        property assignment. Changes to the DOM hierarchy are performed in the same scheduler callback
        as style properties.

        Nodes can be marked for layout explicitly with by setting the `needsLayout` property.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        CSS Fonts level 4 [1] details the font-variation-settings property which allows variations
        to be applied to fonts which accept it. The property accepts a list of key/value
        pairs where the keys are four-character Ascii codes and the values are floating
        point values. The implementation uses font-feature-settings as a model, but with one
        big difference: font-variation-settings can be animated. The set of variation points
        are animated individually.

        This font variations work is being done behind a run-time switch, which is settable from
        the Safari Develop menu.

        Now that FontDescription is growing, I'd like to do an investigation into the possibility of
        moving some of the rare pieces of it into their own class to reduce memory. However, upon
        advice, this investigation will be fairly involved and should be done in its own bug.

        Font features and font variations are similar in that they are identified
        by four-character tags and an associated value. However, the value is an
        int for font features and is a float for font variations. In order to
        simplify code, we can use the same class for both, and use a template

        Remove "rem" unit optimization for document element font size changes

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        We awkwardly track from the parser level if any stylesheet in a document uses any rem units. This is only used to minimally
        optimize a case where document element's (<html>) font size changes dynamically.

        In practice such changes are rare. Browsing around I couldn't find a single case where this optimization got used.
        Even if it was used it would be of low value as a full style resolution is likely to happen anyway (as font inherits)
        and the only thing really saved is that we don't need to invalidate the matched properties cache.

        Change the MemoryCache and CachedResource adjustSize functions to take a long argument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162708
        <rdar://problem/28555702>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Because the MemoryCache stores the size of the cached memory in unsigned,
        two problems my happen when reporting a change in the size of the memory:
        
        1. Signed integer overflow -- which can happen because MemoryCache::adjustSize()
           takes a signed integer argument. If the allocated or the freed memory size is
           larger than the maximum of a signed integer, an overflow will happen.
           For the image caching code, this can be seen where the unsigned decodedSize
           is casted to an integer before passing it to ImageObserver::decodedSizeChanged().

        2. Unsigned integer overflow -- which can happen if the new allocated memory
           size plus the currentSize exceeds the maximum of unsigned.
           This can be seen in MemoryCache::adjustSize() where we add delta to m_liveSize
           or m_deadSize without checking whether this addition will overflow or not. We
           do not assert for overflow although we assert for underflow.
           
        The fix for these two problems can be the following:
        
        1. Make all the adjustSize functions all the way till MemoryCache::adjustSize()
           take a signed long integer argument.
           
        2. Do not create a NativeImagePtr for an ImageFrame if its frameBytes plus the
           ImageFrameCache::decodedSize() will exceed the maximum of an unsigned integer.

        Add support for download attribute on area elements:

        Because HTMLAreaElement inherits from HTMLAnchorElement on native side,

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When we are parsing the up to 4 numbers in an IPv4 address, if we find a syntax violation 
        (the canonicalized address would be different than the input string) then wait to report
        it until we have determined that this is a valid IPv4 address that will be canonicalized.
        If it is not a valid IPv4 address, then we will just treat the characters as the host, and
        that could be no syntax violation.

        Drop first 'state' parameter to JSDOMWindow::toWrapped() / JSEventTarget::toWrapped()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162709

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Drop first 'state' parameter to JSDOMWindow::toWrapped() / JSEventTarget::toWrapped()
        as it is unused. This is the quickest way to allow DOMWindow / EventTarget members
        in IDL dictionaries. This is because the generated bindings code relies on
        convertWrapperType() in JSDOMConvert.h which calls toWrapped() with a single
        parameter. Right now, the only type that requires an ExecState for its toWrapped()
        is XPathNSResolver (which should likely be a callback interface rather than a
        regular interface).

        DOMTokenList’s value and stringifier should not return parsed tokens
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161076

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Updated our implementation of DOMTokenList.prototype.value and its toString function
        to match the latest DOM specification: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-domtokenlist

        "value" attribute, on getting, runs its serialize steps, which simply gets the attribute value.
        On setting, it sets the attribute value with the given value.

        The stringification behavior returns the same serialize steps as "value" attribute on getting.

        This change simplifies our implementation of DOMTokenList and removes the need for m_cachedValue,
        which has been removed in this patch.

        No new tests since existing tests cover this.

        [MSE][Mac] In SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::abort(), support reseting parser to the last appended initialization segment.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135164

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-abort-resets-parser.html

        Use the -[AVStreamDataParser appendStreamData:withFlags:] to implement "resetting" the parser. In this case,
        the parser isn't explicitly reset during resetParserState(), but rather a flag is set so that the next append
        signals a data discontinuity, and the parser is reset at that point.

        Because a previous append operation may be in-flight during this abort(), care must be taken to invalidate any
        operations which may have already started on a background thread. So SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC will use a
        separate WeakPtrFactory for its append operations, will invalidate any outstanding WeakPtrs during an abort(),
        and will block until the previous append() operation completes.

        This will require the WebAVStreamDataParserListener object to occasionally have it's WeakPtr pointing back to the
        SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC to be reset after an abort(), so make that ivar an @property. Rather than passing a
        RetainPtr to itself in all the callbacks it handles, the WebAVStreamDataParserListener can just pass in a copy
        of its own WeakPtr (which may be invalidated during an abort()).

        Break the distinct operations of "abort()" and "resetParserState()" into their own methods in SourceBufferPrivate
        and all its subclasses.

        Add WebIDL special operation support: serializer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156293

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        Added support for the serializer special operation for WebIDLs,
        current implementation adds support for:
          - just the keyword: serializer; It will return all the
            attributes of in an object.
          - map of entries with the attributes: serializer = {attribute1,
            attribute2, ...}

        It creates a toJSON method that returns the serialized value
        converted into an ECMAScript value. For more information check the
        definition of the operation:

        http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-serializers

        We have created a new function in the API of the objects
        that are marked as serializer.

        Used the support to add new API for RTCIceCandidate and
        RTCSessionDescription.

        Move caching the ImageFrame from BitmapImage to ImageSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155498

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        BitmapImage has two modes of operation regarding its image decoding state.
        The first mode happens when a remote image is loaded as encoded data and
        which requires an ImageDecoder to generate the image metadata and the
        the ImageFrames. The second mode happens when a BitmapImage is created
        with a NativeImagePtr. In this case, no ImageDecoder is needed.

        To remove this burden from the BitmapImage the member 'm_frames' is removed
        from BitmapImage. A new member named 'm_frameCache' of type ImageFrameCache
        is added to ImageSource. This class handles caching and recaching the image
        metadata and the ImageFrames if the image needs decoding. When the BitmapImage
        is initialized with a memory image, the ImageFrameCache initializes its
        metadata and ImageFrames directly from the NativeImagePtr.

        The plan for ImageFrameCache is to be extended for the asynchronous image
        decoding and also to be used by the non CG image decoders which cache
        other copies of the ImageFrames. This double caching should be removed.

        When the BitmapImage is replying to the ImageFrame queries, it will ask the
        ImageSource which will pass the query the ImageFrameCache. ImageFrameCache
        will ensure the requested ImageFrame is cached and is valid for the requested
        SubSamplingLevel before accessing the data members of this ImageFrame.

        It should be possible to dispatch events on documents that do not have a browsing
        context (e.g. Documents created using DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument()).
        Gecko and Blink both allow this but WebKit did not.

        The approach chosen to support this is similar to the one in Blink. When constructing
        a new document (e.g. using DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument()) we now keep track
        of the context document. When requesting the scriptExecutionContext(), we now return
        the context document if the document has one instead of the document itself.

        Implement URLParser::syntaxViolation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162593

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Most of the time when parsing URLs, we just look at the URL, find offsets of the host, path, query, etc., 
        and the String can be used untouched.  When this happens, we do not want to allocate and copy the String.
        We want to just add a reference to an existing String.

        Sometimes we need to canonicalize the String because there has been a syntaxViolation,
        defined as any String that is different than its canonicalized URL String.  In such cases we need to
        allocate a new String and fill it with the canonicalized URL String.  When a syntaxViolation happens for the
        first time, we know that everything in the input String up to that point is equal to what it would have been
        if we had canonicalized the beginning of the URL, copy it into a buffer, and continue parsing in a mode where
        instead of just looking at the input URL String, we canonicalize each code point into the buffer.

        Changes to behavior involve additional spec compliance with tabs and newlines in different places in URLs,
        as well as additional spec compliance when parsing empty and null URLs relative to other URLs.
        Both are covered by new API tests. Existing behavior covered by existing API tests.

        This is about a 15% speed improvement on my URL parsing benchmark.

        - Make playback requirement restrictions apply only for the controls manager. Videos that do not
          autoplay will still have the correct behavior with respect to Now Playing, since we will bail in the

        - Only consider the main content heuristic as preventing media controls from showing up for the purposes
          of the controls manager. Now Playing should instead account for this by preferring elements large
          enough for main content after collecting all of the candidate sessions.

        [GTK] Handle Wayland & X11 correctly for GST_GL

        The checks for GST_GL consider X11 and Wayland are exclusive alternatives, but it
        turns out we can enable both! We need to check them independently and also include

        Tweaks the main content heuristic slightly to remove the "mostly in mainframe" requirement in the case of Now
        Playing. This was added in the case of the controls manager as an additional way to identify video elements that
        should not show controls, since we relax audio and video constraints for showing videos in the controls manager,
        so that a video element is prevented from showing controls on grounds of lacking audio only if it has never had
        audio before. In the case of Now Playing, we have stricter requirements for videos, which must have audio, which
        makes the mainframe heuristic not necessary.

        Input elements don't work inside shadow tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160427

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        There is a bug in ComposedTreeIterator. If the iterator is initialized with an initial state where the root
        is inside a shadow tree it won't iterate into slots.

        If an input element is in a shadow tree it generates narrowly scoped style updates. When RenderTreeUpdater
        applies such an update the update root will be inside the shadow tree and the bug will prevent the render tree
        for slotted content from updating.

        Added tests for both the iterator behavior and the specific symptom with input elements.

        Seeking video doesn't update seek position
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162575
        <rdar://problem/28457219>

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        On ToT, seeking in a video causes the playhead to stutter, and does not actually update media remote's seek
        position. This is partly due to how we do not update media remote with new information when beginning to respond
        to remote seek commands, so media remote continues to think that a playing video is still playing despite the
        user attempting to seek through it.

        To fix this, we introduce timer-based guards around remote seek commands, such that a seek "gesture" begins when
        we receive the first seek command and ends when no seek command has been received in a set amount of time (this
        is 0.5 seconds, which is approximately what other clients around the platform use).

        Also, when responding to a remote seek, perform the seek with no tolerance. This prevents the playhead from
        stuttering at the end of a seek from the final requested destination of the seek to the last actually seeked
        time in the video.

        When beginning to seek, we must pause the media. Through existing mechanisms, this causes the media session
        manager to update its Now Playing information, which informs media remote that we are no longer playing and
        prevents us from stuttering. However, when ending a seek, we must also trigger an additional update to again
        refresh media remote's view of the current time. This prevents a flicker when playing media after seeking.

        Unit tests to be added in a follow-up due to time constraints.
