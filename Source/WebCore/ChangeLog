        Abstract logic to log console messages and send CSP violation reports into a client

        First pass at adding infrastructure to supporting CSP reporting from NetworkProcess and workers.
        Replaces the existing ContentSecurityPolicy constructor that takes a Frame with one that
        takes a ContentSecurityPolicyClient to delegate to for logging and sending reports. We will look
        to remove ContentSecurityPolicy constructor that takes a ScriptExecutionContext in a follow up.

        Standardize on instantiating a ContentSecurityPolicy with the full URL to resource that it protects
        instead of taking only the SecurityOrigin of this URL. By taking the full URL the ContentSecurityPolicy
        object is now capable of resolving a relative report URL without needing a Document/ScriptExecutionContext.

        We are underutilizing the CSPInfo struct and ContentSecurityPolicyClient::willSendCSPViolationReport()
        delegate callback in this patch. We will make use of this functionality in a subsequent patch to
        support collecting script state (e.g. source line number) when reporting CSP violations in worker
        threads. We also no longer go through the unnecessary motions to try to collect script state for a
        frame-ancestors violation (since DocumentLoader extends ContentSecurityPolicyClient and does not
        implement ContentSecurityPolicyClient::willSendCSPViolationReport()). The frame-ancestors directive
        is checked before a document is parsed and executes script; => there will never be any script state
        to collect; => it is not necessary to try to collect it as we currently do.

        Stop using an iframe's id as fallback if its name attribute is not set
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11388

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        WebKit had logic to use an iframe's id as fallback name when its name
        content attribute is not set. This behavior was not standard and did not
        match other browsers:
        - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-iframe-name

        Gecko / Trident never behaved this way. Blink was aligned with us until
        they started to match the specification in:
        - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347169

        This WebKit quirk was causing some Web-compatibility issues because it
        would affect the behavior of Window's name property getter when trying
        to look up an iframe by id. Because of Window's named property getter
        behavior [1], we would return the frame's contentWindow instead of the
        iframe element itself.

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        We generate unique names for Frame to be used in HistoryItem. Those names not only
        need to be unique, they also need to be repeatable to avoid layout tests flakiness
        and for things like restoring form state from a HistoryItem.

        The previously generated frame names were relying on the Frame's index among a
        parent Frame's children. The issue was that we could end up with duplicate names
        because one could insert a Frame *before* an existing one. This is because the code
        would not take care of updating existing Frames' unique name on frame tree mutation.

        Updating frame tree names on mutation would be inefficient and is also not necessary.
        The approach chosen in this patch is to stop using the Frame's index and instead rely
        on an increasing counter stored on the top-frame's FrameTree. To make the names
        repeatable, we reset the counter on page navigation.

        When inserting multiple URLs as individual items in a single drop, we currently separate each item with a space
        (see r217284). However, it still seems difficult to tell dropped links apart. This patch makes some slight
        tweaks to WebContentReader::readURL so that it inserts line breaks before dropped URLs, if the dropped URL isn't
        the first item to be inserted in the resulting document fragment.

        The crash is caused by HTMLMediaElement::~HTMLMediaElement canceling the resource load via CachedResource

        Stop using an iframe's id as fallback if its name attribute is not set
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11388

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        WebKit had logic to use an iframe's id as fallback name when its name
        content attribute is not set. This behavior was not standard and did not
        match other browsers:
        - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-iframe-name

        Gecko / Trident never behaved this way. Blink was aligned with us until
        they started to match the specification in:
        - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347169

        This WebKit quirk was causing some Web-compatibility issues because it
        would affect the behavior of Window's name property getter when trying
        to look up an iframe by id. Because of Window's named property getter
        behavior [1], we would return the frame's contentWindow instead of the
        iframe element itself.

        REGRESSION(r225868): Release assert when removing an SVGUseElement from Document::m_svgUseElements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182188
        <rdar://problem/36689240>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Fixed the crash by removing up the release assert.

        The crash is likely caused by re-entrancy to Document::resolveStyle during SVGUseElement::updateShadowTree.
        Because Document::resolveStyle invokes updateShadowTree on SVG use elements in Document::m_svgUseElements
        without clearing the map, the nested call to resolveStyle ends up calling updateShadowTree() for all elements
        in m_svgUseElements and removing them all from the map. When the stack frame eventually comes back to the outer
        invocation of Document::resolveStyle, updateShadowTree gets invoked for the second time on SVG use elements
        whose shadow tree had already been updated within the inner invocation to updateShadowTree, and release-asserts.

        There is an alternative fix: avoid calling updateShadowTree on a svg element when shadowTreeNeedsUpdate returns
        true on the element in resolveStyle. However, removing the release assert is a sure way to fix the crash so
        this patch opts for that fix instead especially since we don't have any reproducible test case for this crash.

        This release assertion was added in r225868 as a cautious measure to catch any use-after-frees of SVGUseElement's
        since m_svgUseElements stored raw pointes to SVG use elements but this crash is not an indicative of any UAF,
        and there is no evidence that r225868 has led to new UAFs even after five months.

        No new tests. I couldn't find a way to trigger a nested style update inside SVGUseElement::updateShadowTree.

        In a previous version of the CSS Fonts spec, there was text saying that items in font collections

        inserting an item into the middle of a collection would throw off all content that uses the file.

        [Extra zoom mode] Respect the existing shrink-to-fit attribute instead of using min-device-width
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185132

        Removes the `min-device-width` attribute added in r231095. Instead, we key this behavior off of the
        `shrink-to-fit` attribute introduced for multitasking on iPad, such that `shrink-to-fit=no` achieves the same
        behavior as `min-device-width=0` in extra zoom mode. See comments below for more detail.

        [LFC] Implement BlockFormattingContext::layout logic and its dependencies
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185024

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch implements the logic for block formatting context according to
        https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#block-formatting

        1. Traverse the tree iteratively (in post-order fashion) and compute the width/static position for the containers as
        we visit the descendant nodes until we hit a leaf node.
        2. Compute the position/geometry of the leaf node and move over to its sibling(s).
        3. Finalize the container's height/final position as we climb back on the tree.
        4. Run layout on the out-of-flow descendants.  

        Note that subtrees with a formatting context root need to be laid out completely before moving on to the next box.
        The formatting root box is laid out in the formatting context it lives in, however its descendants get laid out
        in a separate formatting context (excluding out-of-flow boxes that don't belong to the root).

        [Extra zoom mode] Add a mechanism to override default viewport behaviors in extra zoom mode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185050
        <rdar://problem/39624038>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, in extra zoom mode, there's no way for web pages to opt out of the default viewport behaviors
        (namely, laying out at a larger width and shrinking to fit) when the web view is very tall and narrow. This
        patch adds a new experimental viewport attribute, "min-device-width", that can be used to prevent WebKit from
        automatically clamping the web view width to a greater value for the device width in this scenario.

        Note that after this patch, logic that plumbs a minimumLayoutSize from WKWebView to the viewport configuration
        will need to be renamed to reflect that this size is no longer the minimum layout size, but rather, the view
        size that is used for viewport device dimensions by default. This refactoring will be done in a followup part.

        See per-method comments below for more detail.

        (WebCore::ViewportConfiguration::shouldOverrideDeviceWidthWithMinDeviceWidth const):

        Replaces `m_forceHorizontalShrinkToFit`. Whether or not we shrink to fit is now determined by whether the

        The formatting root boxes are supposed to be all const. The only reason why
        they are not is because WeakPtr<> does not support const objects yet.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181855

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        The goal of this move is to handle the limitation of SVP (Secure Video Path) memory size.

        When the decryptor is in the AppendPipeline and we use SVP, we buffer in MediaSource queue
        the decrypted GstBuffers that are in SVP memory.
        This behavior cause an out-of-memory error, because we are limited in SVP memory size.

        By moving the decryptor in PlaybackPipeline, we avoid to buffer the decrypted GstBuffers
        which use the SVP memory and we buffer the encrypted GstBuffers that are in system memory.

        This new architecture also allows to start the buffering before obtaining the DRM license
        and it makes easier to manage dynamic change of the license or Key.

        The decryptor is auto plugged by GStreamer playbin in PlaybackPipeline.

        SVP: Secure Video Path also named trusted or protected video path, it is a memory which is
        protected by a hardware access control engine, it is not accessible to other unauthorised
        software or hardware components.

        Add a new message "decrypt-key-needed" that the decryptor can send when it doesn't have an available key.
        This message should be handled by the application in order to dispatch or send the key to the decryptor.
        This patch is a preparation for the patch 181855.
        With the patch 181855, the decryptor will be in the PlaybackPipeline instead of AppendPipeline, thus we can
        get the DRM license or key before to instantiate or load the decryptor plugin in PlaybackPipeline.
        When the decryptor plugin is instantiated or loaded, it should able to ask the application to resend
        the DRM license or key by using this new message "decrypt-key-needed".

        Implement rendering support for the color-filter CSS property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185047
        rdar://problem/39664967

        The color-filter property transforms CSS colors just before painting. To support this,
        add to RenderStyle colorByApplyingColorFilter() and visitedDependentColorWithColorFilter().
        At most calls sites that transform colors for rendering, replace calls to
        visitedDependentColor() with visitedDependentColorWithColorFilter(). The few locations
        that don't use visitedDependentColor() (e.g. for shadows) call colorByApplyingColorFilter().
        
        Color transformation is implemented via a new virtual function on FilterOperation;
        BasicColorMatrixFilterOperation overrides this to use a new ColorMatrix class to
        do color math, and BasicComponentTransferFilterOperation to do the equivalent of component
        transfer operations. The math in both cases matches that for SVG filters, with the exception
        that color components are stored as floats through multiple filters and then mapped to
        normal 0-255 color components at the end.

        takes a ResourceRequest by rvalue reference, but it never actually takes ownership of this
        ResourceRequest and subsequently makes a copy of it when instantiating a CachedResourceRequest.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        When a Cookie object was converted to NSHTTPCookie object, the HTTPOnly property information
        was lost so the delete function cannot find the proper cookie to delete.
        This patch implements a workaround that compares Cookie object instead of NSHTTPCookie 
        object. We might want to add the ability to set HTTPOnly header during conversion if there
        is an easy way to do it later.

        [GTK][WPE] Initial ASYNC_SCROLLING support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184961

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Add CoordinatedGraphics-specific code that will be required for async
        scrolling support. The ScrollingCoordinatorCoordinatedGraphics and
        ScrollingTreeCoordinatedGraphics classes are mostly complete already,
        but the new ScrollingTreeNode-inheriting classes will need further
        work that will have to be done in parallel with other improvements
        planned for the CoordinatedGraphics subsystem.

        While the build-time flag is enabled, the feature is still not enabled
        at runtime due to being marked as unsupported by the DrawingArea
        implementation in the WebKit layer. It would also not work yet if it
        were enabled due to the before-mentioned pending changes.

        Various build fixes that address non-Cocoa usage of ASYNC_SCROLLING
        code are included.

        [Mac] Number of drop items is always 0 when performing a DHTML drag

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        New API test: DragAndDropPasteboardTests.NumberOfValidItemsForDrop

        DragController tracks the number of items to be accepted by a file input element, taking
        into account whether the control is disabled or accepts multiple files. When this number
        changes, WebKit informs the NSDraggingInfo-conforming object passed to -draggingUpdated by
        calling -setNumberOfValidItemsForDrop:. This number is presented to the user in a badge
        rendered next to the dragging item thumbnails.

        When performing a DHTML drag, we don't know how many items the page will accept, so prior
        to this patch we would render a "0" in the badge. This is misleading, because the page is
        more likely to accept all the items (or at least one of them) rather than none of them.

        Let's do the straightforward thing and set numberOfValidItemsForDrop to equal the number of
        files in the drag operation when performing a DHTML file drag.

        Convert an existing ScriptDisallowedScope::EventAllowedScope which only disables the debug assertions

        Because SVG font is loaded in a document isolated from the rest of the page (m_externalSVGDocument),
        there is no security implication to execute scripts in this isolated document.

        Unfortunately, no new tests. I could never make CachedSVGFont::ensureCustomFontData to get called inside
        style resolution with m_externalSVGDocument set to nullptr after many attempts. Even EventAllowedScope
        I added 13 months ago in r211965, which this patch replaces by DisableAssertionsInScope, is not utilized
        by the existing layout tests since removing the assertion doesn't cause any layout test to hit an assertion.

        In that case, the peer connection constructor will later on throw.

        [CoordGraphics] Remove dead fixed layer code

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Remove CoordinatedGraphicsLayer::setFixedToViewport() and the
        corresponding attribute on the CoordinatedGraphicsLayerState struct.
        The method is not called anywhere since r230952.

        CoordinatedGraphicsState struct also loses the scrollPosition attribute
        that also isn't used anymore.

        Changes to GraphicsLayerTextureMapper class mirror those made to
        CoordinatedGraphicsLayer, removing support for the fixed-to-viewport
        attribute. This too was not called from anywhere.

        All that enables us removing fixed-to-viewport handling in the
        TextureMapperLayer class. Along with related changes in the
        CoordinatedGraphicsScene class, we're able to remove a bunch of methods
        and member variables that are not used or needed anymore.

        [CoordGraphics] Remove unused fixed layout functionality

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Ports using the CoordinatedGraphics subsystem don't expose fixed layout
        support. As such, we're able to remove a lot of unused code and
        unnecessary USE(COORDINATED_GRAPHICS) special cases in generic sections
        in both WebCore and WebKit.

        With fixed layout not available for use to users of the GTK+ and WPE
        ports, we can remove the ScrollingCoordinatorCoordinatedGraphics
        implementation, making room for an implementation that inherits from
        AsyncScrollingCoordinator in the future. For that purpose the
        ScrollingCoordinator::create() function is moved into the
        ScrollingCoordinatorCoordinatedGraphics.cpp file already.

        This also enables removing delegatedScrollRequested() method from
        HostWindow and the inheriting ChromeClient interface.

        [WPE][GTK] Remove WlUniquePtr<wl_display> footgun
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184405

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        WlUniquePtr<wl_display> is a pretty big footgun because there are two different destruction
        functions -- wl_display_disconnect() and wl_display_destroy() -- and which one you need to
        use depends on how the wl_display() was created, and WebKit uses both in different places.
        So WlUniquePtr<wl_display> is pretty unsafe. See bug #176490 for an example of fun caused
        by using it incorrectly.

        Let's use std::unique_ptr with custom deleter functors instead.

        [Extra zoom mode] 100vw is roughly half of the viewport width in extra zoom mode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184871
        <rdar://problem/39477595>

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        Currently, when computing CSS viewport units, we use ViewportConfiguration::initialScaleIgnoringContentSize().
        This method computes an initial scale from the layout width and height without relying on any information
        derived from the current content size. This is done to ensure that the content size and viewport dimensions for
        CSS viewport units should not be simultaneously dependent on each other.

        Since shrink-to-fit heuristics depend on content size, we currently assume that shrink-to-fit is disabled when
        computing initialScaleIgnoringContentSize, by always passing in `false` for `shouldIgnoreScalingConstraints`.
        However, in extra zoom mode, the opposite is true: since we force both `m_canIgnoreScalingConstraints` and
        `m_forceHorizontalShrinkToFit` to be `true` in this mode, we will always try to shrink-to-fit regardless of
        content size.

        Because of this shrink-to-fit disparity between `initialScale` and `initialScaleIgnoringContentSize`, viewport
        units in extra zoom mode are currently computed assuming an initial scale set by the page, whereas the real
        viewport is scaled to fit, which causes any lengths computed in terms of vw and vh to be incorrect. To fix this,
        we introduce a version of shouldIgnoreScalingConstraints() that returns `true` iff scaling constraints are
        always ignored, regardless of content size. We then use this in initialScaleIgnoringContentSize, instead of
        always passing in `false` for `shouldIgnoreScalingConstraints`.

        In this patch instead of triggering layout, we just convert the simple line runs to

        [MSE] Add allSamplesInTrackEnqueued event
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184737

        MediaSource has a .endOfStream() method to signal when there are no more frames
        after the ones currently buffered.

        This bit of data is important for some multimedia frameworks. For instance, in
        GStreamer a stream of frames being decoded should be terminated by a
        'end-of-stream' (EOS) event that has a similar meaning. Some GStreamer elements
        will expect this event in order to work properly under some circumstances.

        Unfortunately currently WebKit provides no mechanism for this: an event of
        sorts should be emitted after no more frames are going to be enqueued to signal
        the end of the stream. The closest mechanism WebKit has for this is
        `markEndOfStream()`, but it's not exactly the same: markEndOfStream() informs
        that -- as far as network buffering is concerned -- we are done; but at that
        point there may still be (and often are) many frames waiting in the
        decodeQueue, so it would be wrong to signal the decoder that there are no more
        frames.

        This patch introduces a new optional method in SourceBufferPrivate,
        `allSamplesInTrackEnqueued(const AtomicString& trackID)` that is called
        whenever the MediaSource is in "ended" state (the user has called
        `MediaSource.endOfStream()`) and the decodeQueue is empty. Media framework
        implementations can use this method to send a EOS event to a decoder that needs
        it.

        RunLoop facilities to run the scrolling thread and dispatch
        callbacks on that thread.

        ScrollingThread::initializeRunLoop() retrieves address of the
        thread-specific RunLoop and signals the Condition object.
        ScrollingThread::wakeUpRunLoop() uses RunLoop::dispatch() to schedule
        callback dispatches on the scrolling thread.

        ScrollingThread::createThreadIfNeeded() mimics Cocoa implementation and
        waits for the RunLoop address to be retrieved before continuing.

        [Modern Media Controls] Show a loading indicator after pressing the play button in compact mode

        <rdar://problem/38939468>

        We now display a loading indicator after pressing the play button when in compact mode. We also update the
        behavior to use assets provided through WebKitAdditions (see webkit.org/b/184862) for the play button and
        the invalid icon. Additionally, we always show a 20% opaque black overlay in the background while any piece
        of user interface is up.

        * Modules/modern-media-controls/controls/compact-activity-indicator.css: Added.
        (button.compact-activity-indicator > picture): The loading indicator asset is a sprite made of 23 frames, so
        we specify the mask size (since all buttons are rendered via a mask) to be 23 * 100% the rendered size. The
        display of the loading indicator is performed with a first intro animation which runs once through the first
        8 frames and then a continuously looping animation going through the remaining frames. We use a frames()
        timing function to achieve the frame-by-frame effect while using only from/to keyframe animations. When we
        fade out, we use a simply opacity fade, which is combined with the spinning animation. We use CSS variables
        to encode both animations so they can be used combined or one at a time without redefining the whole animation
        property.
        (button.compact-activity-indicator.spins > picture): Use the "spins" animation variable when spinning.
        (button.compact-activity-indicator.spins.fades-out > picture): Combine the "spins" and "fades-out" animation

        We accomplish this illusion by allowing the text field's decorations to wrap, specifying flex
        shrink factors, a flex basis and hiding overflow. Hiding overflow is accomplished by a
        combination of setting "overflow: hidden", "text-overflow: clip", and patching RenderTextControlSingleLine::layout()
        to ensure that the height of the container element is equal to the intrinsic height of the
        inner elements. Because the container is a flex box and we want to vertically center its
        contents we also need to fix up the y-position of the container element as it may have flexed
        as a result of forcing its height to match the intrinsic height of the inner elements.

        a second layout of this renderer. This is needed because we vertically center the elements in this
        renderer and adjusting the height of the container may cause it to flex and re-position along its
        cross axis when the container's height is taller than the inner element's height (e.g. the "Strong
        Password" label wraps to the next line). This re-positioning causes a noticeable jitter when
        transitioning from a field that has a visible "Strong Password" label to one that does not. Caching
        and restoring the logical top of the container element avoids this jitter.

        Now that the issue [1] about the syntax ambiguity has been resolved we

        Since we allow all the values valid for each longhand, we'll update
        in this CL the corresponding web platform tests. Additionally, this CL
        updates also the shorthand serialization tests [2], which didn't
        consider the new value 'legacy' for justify-items (and place-items) due

        In r229133, we stopped doing navigation policy checks for about:blank because about:blank
        loads need to happen synchronously for Web-compatibility. However, this regressed loading
        an HTML string in a WebView because in such cases, the URL is also about:blank with

        JS wrappers for the window then point to a cross-origin window which is remote (i.e.
        hosted in another WebProcess).

        The RemoteDOMWindow exposed to JS looks like a regular cross-origin Window with a few
        exceptions due to our incomplete implementation (e.g. w.location returns null) and 
        most of its API is currently not functional. The RemoteDOMWindow API will be implemented

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        In CoordinatedImageBacking::update(), when drawing the image into a
        freshly-created image backing, we can avoid save-and-restoring the
        painting context. We also don't have to clip it, since the clipping area
        is the same as the image (and buffer) bounds. Since the buffer is
        initialized to transparent color, we can use the CompositeCopy operator
        to just copy image data into the destination since there's nothing to
        paint the source over.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184678
        <rdar://problem/39422122>

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Frament navigations need to happen synchronously for Web-compatibility. Because of this,
        r225657 added code to make sure that if the client does not make the navigation policy
        decision synchronously for frament navigations, then we'll stop waiting for the client
        and proceed with the navigation. However, r229831 make the navigation policy decision
        IPC decision, meaning that even if the client responds synchronously, it would be
        asynchronously from WebCore's point of view. As a result, we would always ignore the
        client's policy decision when doing a fragment navigation.

        This is an issue on iclould.com because the web-app links are fragment URLs. When you
        CMD+click one of these link, we do the navigation policy check. As a result of this
        check, Safari responds IGNORE to the policy decision and instead decides to load the
        link in a new tab (because CMD key is pressed). Due to the bug mentioned above, we
        would not obey the IGNORE policy decision from Safari and load the link in the current
        tab, even though Safari would already be loading it in a new tab.

        To address the issue, I reintroduced a synchronous code path for navigation policy
        decision making, backed by synchronous IPC. This synchronous code path is now used for
        fragment navigations to restore pre-r229831 behavior. If the client does not answer
        synchronously, we'll proceed with the navigation anyway, as was happening pre-r229831.

        Add bindings code for RemoteDOMWindow. A RemoteDOMWindow behaves exactly like a cross-origin
        DOMWindow, which is backed by a RemoteDOMWindow object instead of a DOMWindow one. Since
        a RemoteDOMWindow is always cross origin, we do not need cross-origin checks and the bindings
        code is identical to the DOMWindow code paths from cross-origin handling.

        JSRemoteDOMWindow unfortunately currently needs to be a global object because of:
        1. a JSProxy's target needs to be a JSGlobalObject currently
        2. The 'structure()->setGlobalObject(vm, &window);' call in
           JSDOMWindowProxy::setWindow(VM&, JSDOMGlobalObject&) which requires a JSGlobalObject.
        Ideally, this wouldn't be the case in the future but this would require some code refactoring.
        Our DOM global objects normally subclass JSDOMGlobalObject so I decided to subclass JSDOMGlobalObject,
        which brings some things our bindings code expect. However, subclassing JSDOMGlobalObject directly is
        problematic because it does not hold the m_wrapped implementation pointer. To address this issue, all
        our our DOM global objects have a JS*Base base class which subclasses JSDOMGlobalObject and stores the
        m_wrapped implementation pointer. I followed the same pattern here.

        Animated GIF imagery with finite looping are falling one loop short
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The Netscape Looping Application Extension is a block which may be added
        to a GIF file to tell the viewer to loop through the entire GIF frames.
        This is communicated through two bytes designated for the "loopCount" in
        this block.

        The entire block may not be found in the GIF, in which case the GIF is 
        supposed to animate its entire frames only once.

        If the block exists and loopCount = 0, this means the image has to loop
        through its frames indefinitely.

        If the block exist and loopCount > 0, this should mean the image has to
        loop through its frames loopCount + 1 times. The extra loop seems to be
        the consensus among most of the GIF generators and viewers. For example,
        if the image designer wants the image to loop through its frames n times:
        -- The GIF generator (e.g. Adobe Photoshop and https://ezgif.com/maker) 
           will write n - 1 for loopCount. However http://gifmaker.me and 
           http://gifmaker.org write n for loopCount.
        -- The browser (e.g. Chrome 65.0.3325 181 and FireFox Quantum 59.0.2) will
           translate loopCount = n - 1 to: animate GIF once + loop n - 1, which 
           means loop the GIF n times.

        Because the specs are not really clear about this, we are going to consider
        the agreed-upon behavior among most of the web browsers the specs here.

        We must call updateFinishedState() when an animation gets sampled as it means its timeline's time has progressed
        and it may have crossed to a finished state. Calling updateFinishedState() when sampling means that we'll correctly
        set the animation's hold time to its end value, which means that currentTime() will now always be clamped to return
        the end time once its has reached it, so we must not schedule animations to resolve immediately anymore since otherwise
        they will keep being scheduled in a loop.

        a variety of reasons and can be eventually cancelled with exitPresent(). Once we are
        presenting we could access the presenting layers (right now just one) with getLayers().

        Note that we are not presenting anything to the HMD yet, that will be done later in a follow
        up patch.

        Introduce remote variants of Frame / DOMWindow classes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184467
        <rdar://problem/39011267>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Introduce remote variants of Frame / DOMWindow classes, for when these frames / windows
        are hosted on another WebProcess. Those will be used in a follow-up patch.

        The hierarchy is as follows (class naming will be improved in a follow-up patch to minimise
        patch size):
        - AbstractFrame: A frame that can be either local or remote (hosted on another WebProcess)
            - Frame: A local frame
            - RemoteFrame: A frame hosted on another WebProcess. A RemoteFrame's window is also remote.
        - AbstractDOMWindow: A window that be either local or remote (hosted on another WebProcess)
            - DOMWindow: A local DOMWindow
            - RemoteDOMWindow: A window hosted on another WebProcess. A RemoteDOMWindow's frame is also
              remote. A RemoteDOMWindow is always cross-origin.

        This patch introduces global identifiers (unique across all WebProcesses) for both Frames and
        Windows. This is useful as we need to know which Frame / DOMWindow a particular RemoteFrame /
        RemoteDOMWindow is pointing to.

        Follow-up patch will add support for converting a local DOMWindow / Frame into a remote ones,
        when a newly opened window (via window.open) is navigated cross-origin (Bug 184515).

        Other things we'll need to implement in follow-ups:
        - RemoteDOMWindow will need to know about its opener in order to support the window.opener
          API. Internally, the opener will be stored as a RemoteFrame so that window.opener always
          returns the current window in the opener frame (which changes upon navigation).
        - Nullify a RemoteDOMWindow's frame whenever the window it is pointing to becomes frameless.
          A frameless window behaves very differently (e.g. very little API is exposed to the Web).
          This happens when either the newly opened window is either closed or navigated.

        once via "all" and once explicitly, ensure we look at all currently running transitions for the currently-processed property to

        start transitions even if the duration is 0 provided the delay is a positive, non-zero value. Then, if there is a CSS Animation

        instead of a default RenderStyle which would not use the right values for implicit keyframes.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::stylesWouldYieldNewCSSTransitionsBlendingKeyframes const): Look at the property used to create
        the transition rather than that specified on the backing Animation object since it can be CSSPropertyInvalid in the case of

        [GTK] WaylandCompositorDisplay leaks its wl_display
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184406

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Well, this was harder than expected. We really just want to fix a small leak in the WebKit
        layer, but that requires a change in how WaylandCompositorDisplay calls the
        PlatformDisplayWayland constructor, to pass NativeDisplayOwned::Yes. That means
        WaylandCompositorDisplay can no longer use PlatformDisplayWayland's protected default
        constructor. Problem is that the normal PlatformDisplayWayland constructor calls
        PlatformDisplayWayland::initialize, which calls PlatformDisplayWayland::registryGlobal,
        which is a virtual function. The WaylandCompositorDisplay portion of the object is not
        constructed yet at this point, so WaylandCompositorDisplay::registryGlobal will never be
        called if we do that. I had to revert the previous version of this fix due to this problem.
        It had broken accelerated compositing.

        I'm reminded of Effective C++ item #9: Never call virtual functions during construction or
        destruction ("because such calls will never go to a more derived class than that of the
        currently executing constructor or destructor"). This code is fragile and likely to break
        again in the future, so let's refactor it a bit. Instead of calling initialize in the
        constructor, we'll call it from create functions. We'll have to add a couple create
        functions, and make the constructor protected to ensure it's not possible to create a
        PlatformDisplayWayland without initializing it. For good parallelism, do the same for the
        other PlatformDisplay classes.

        This commit additionally removes PlatformDisplayWayland's protected default constructor,
        since it's not needed anymore.

        The NativeDisplayOwned arguments to the PlatformDisplay constructors are now mandatory,
        instead of using NativeDisplayOwned::No as the default value, since that was dangerously
        close to being the cause of this leak, and the constructors are now accessed from private
        create functions anyway. Some more caution when using default parameter values is warranted
        in the future.

        Lastly, since we have to change PlatformDisplay::createPlatformDisplay to use the new create
        functions, take the opportunity to move things around a bit for clarity. There should be no
        change in behavior. I was just disappointed that the PlatformDisplayWPE creation was at the
        bottom of the function, after a comment indicating that normal display creation has failed,
        which is not the case for WPE.

        This all might have been a bit overkill, since the leak could probably have been fixed by
        passing nullptr to the PlatformDisplayWayland constructor for the wl_display and not
        removing WaylandCompositorDisplay's call to PlatformDisplayWayland::initialize. But the
        correctness of that code would then rely on implementation details of initialize, so this
        refactor seems better.

        No new tests since there *should* be no behavior change. Then again, I'm touching
        PlatformDisplay, and history shows we don't have the greatest track record of touching this
        code without introducing problems.

        ImageFrame type used by non-Cocoa image decoder should not be the same as that used by ImageSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184418

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        ScalableImageDecoder uses ImageFrame class which is meant to be an implementation detail of ImageSource.
        There are bunch of fields and methods in the type that are only used by one or the other client. For hackability
        there should be an unrelated frame type for ScalableImageDecoder.

        This patch adds ScalableImageDecoderFrame type used in ScalableImageDecoder only. It then cleans up
        unneeded things from both ImageFrame and ScalableImageDecoderFrame.

        WebCore::EventHandler::targetPositionInWindowForSelectionAutoscroll is directly accessing NSScreen
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184344
        <rdar://problem/39224969>

        Reviewed by Per Arne Vollan.

        The implementation of targetPositionInWindowForSelectionAutoscroll uses the display ID to get the
        screen boundaries of the current display. This causes a bunch of interaction with NSScreen that
        we do not want to allow in the WebContent process.

        Instead, we should just use the cached screen information the WebContent process already possesses.

        This patch makes the following changes:
        1. We now retrieve the screen rect of the page's display from the cache, rather than interacting with
           the WindowServer directly.
        2. Add a new 'toUserSpaceForPrimaryScreen' so we don't have to deal with a nil NSWindow when computing
           the user space version of the coordinates. A nil Window just means we want to get coordinates in
           terms of the primary display.
        3. Keep track of the primary display so we can refer to it later.
        4. Modify the IPC messages to include the primary display's ID so we can easily access it later.
        5. Modify the PlatformScreen methods to actually use the primary display when appropriate, rather

        Make InlineTextBox::createTextRun() take a const lvalue reference String
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184182

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        InlineTextBox::createTextRun() takes a non-const lvalue reference String.
        It is tempting to change the signature of this method to take a const lvalue 
        reference. But this was done intentionally. TextRun is effectively a StringView:
        it does not own the passed string. Having the argument a non-const lvalue
        reference makes the compiler prevent calls like createTextRun("abc").

        To have a better way to express the lifetime of TextRun, this patch does
        the following:

        -- It makes TextRun::m_text of type String instead of StringView.
        -- It adds a new constructor which takes const String&. This constructor
           will addRef the underlying StringImpl when assigning it to m_text.
        -- It keeps the constructor which takes a StringView. The caller of this
           constructor still has to make sure the underlying String outlives the
           TextRun. To avoid copying the underlying buffer of the StringView, we
           will not use  StringView::toString(). Instead we will use
           StringView::toStringWithoutCopying() which makes the returned String 
           accesses the same buffer the StringView uses. In this case, the returned
           String is effectively a StringView.

        There is no need for this function to take a String argument anymore. The
        reason for passing the String was to guarantee its lifetime by keeping
        a copy of it in the caller side. Now there is no need for that. The TextRun
        itself will keep this copy.

        This will make it straightforward for a caller to set new loader options as needed.
        In particular, this will make it straightforward to support setting the request's

        can lead to missed opportunities to WTFMove() a String object into Exception such mistakes
        are just that, missed opportunities. That is, correctness is not affected and we may perform

        The layout test fast/canvas/canvas-blending-global-alpha.html is failing when the WebContent process does not have WindowServer access.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183752
        <rdar://problem/38635731>

        The test is failing because the system is only providing software rendering when there is no access
        to the WindowServer, and software rendering is producing slightly different results than hardware
        rendering. To enable accelerated rendering, the GPU to be used for IOSurface rendering needs to be
        selected by handing over the OpenGL display mask to the IOSurface CGContext.

        Failures from mach port reference handling should be fatal
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184202
        <rdar://problem/37771114>

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        We may corrupt the Mach port space by improperly matching the equivalent of reference counting
        retains (mach_port_mod_refs) with releases (mach_port_deallocate).

        Our current implementation of MachSendRights::create does not grab a reference if the passed
        port is MACH_PORT_DEAD, but we unconditionally call mach_port_deallocate on the port, which
        could lead to a reference count mismatch.

        Likewise, our MachSendRight destructor does not release the port if it has changed to MACH_PORT_DEAD
        (e.g., if a child process dies), again leading to a mismatch in retain/releases.

        Finally, failures in mach_port_deallocate should be fatal because they indicate that the
        application was attempting to remove an unowned right. This is a fatal condition for Mach, and
        should lead to an abort. 

        This patch does the following:

        1. It creates a helper function that does the right thing for safely deallocating a mach port.
        2. It uses it in multiple places.
        3. It revises 'MachSendRight::create" so that it properly handles the condition of a dead port.
        4. It revises the MachSendRight destructor to properly handle the condition of a dead port.

        No new tests, no change in behavior expected.

        When performing a drag operation where the pasteboard contains both a file path and a file
        promise, we have historically preferred to accept the file path. Some versions of Photos.app
        will provide both a low-resolution thumbnail as a file path and its high-resolution
        counterpart as a file promise when dragging a photo, and our current logic leads us to
        choose the low-quality thumbnail.

        This patch changes our logic to prefer file promises over file paths. This matches the
        behavior of Finder and ensures we accept high-resolution assets from Photos.app.

        Covered by existing file promise drag tests. beginDragWithFilePromises() was updated to
        write a bogus file path to the pasteboard along with the legitimate file promise.

        [CMake] gperf path should be given when WebCore/css/makevalues.pl is executed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184224

        Reviewed by Konstantin Tokarev.

        When a building evironment doens't include a path to gperf,
        WebCore/css/makevalue.pl failes due to failing to execute gperf,
        so the full path to gperf should be given like WebCore/css/makeprop.pl.

        No new tests, no Web-facing behavior change.

        * CMakeLists.txt: gperf path is given to css/makevalues.pl.
        * css/makevalues.pl: Add an argument to handle a given gperf path.

        Drop MainFrame class and move contents into Page / Frame since there is a 1:1
        relationship between the Page and the MainFrame.

        This is ground work for introducing LocalFrame / RemoteFrame concepts.

        Make SecurityOrigin safe to create and use from any thread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184216

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        We found that we have a decent amount of code constructing and using SecurityOrigin
        objects from non-main threads. Unfortunately, this was not safe, mostly due to
        SecurityOrigin's reliance on the SchemeRegistry.

        This patch makes it safe to construct a SecurityOrigin on any thread A and use
        it later on the same thread A. However, developers still need to call isolatedCopy()
        if they want to pass such object to another thread B.

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        GResources are loaded in the WebProcess using ResourceHandle because soup handles them transparently. But now
        that we no longer use ResourceHandle, we can add a simple loader for GResources, similar to the one used for
        data URLS, since loading a GResource is a matter of calling g_resources_lookup_data() in the end.

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        Since r229828, we freeze the layer tree during the navigation policy check.
        We freeze in WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDecidePolicyForNavigationAction()
        and unfreeze in WebFrameLoaderClient::didDecidePolicyForNavigationAction().

        WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDecidePolicyForNavigationAction() gets called
        from PolicyChecker::checkNavigationPolicy() which has 3 call sites in
        FrameLoader and one in DocumentLoader for redirects. The call sites in
        FrameLoader were taking care of calling didDecidePolicyForNavigationAction()
        on the FrameLoaderClient in their completion handler, but the DocumentLoader
        call site was failing to do so. As a result, the layer tree would stay frozen.

        To make this a lot less error prone, I moved the call to
        WebFrameLoaderClient::didDecidePolicyForNavigationAction() to
        PolicyChecker::checkNavigationPolicy(), inside the completion handler passed
        to WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDecidePolicyForNavigationAction(). This way,
        even if new code starts calling PolicyChecker::checkNavigationPolicy(), we
        do not need to worry about letting the client know when the policy decision
        is made.

        No new tests, covered by existing redirection tests with the
        new assertion I added.

        When performing a drag-and-drop of a PDF document image (WebCore::PDFDocumentImage) we create a WebArchive

        expects that the created WebArchive is either for an inline image (e.g. <img>) or an image document that
        has a supported image resource MIME type (by querying MIMETypeRegistry::isSupportedImageResourceMIMEType())
        and checks for these cases in this order. PDF/PostScript are not listed in the set of supported image
        resource MIME types. So, the first check fails and WebKit assumes that the WebArchive was created from
        an image document of a supported image resource MIME type. However, the WebArchive was created from a
        WebHTMLView and has MIME type text/html. Therefore the assertion fails. We need to add PDF and PostScript
        to the set of supported image resource MIME types so that WebKit does not fall back to the WebHTMLView
        code path. Historically, PDF and PostScript were in the set supported image resource MIME types. Over time
        the set of MIME types for image resouces (images loaded as a document) became identical to the set of MIME
        types for images loaded inline (e.g. <img>) and this set omitted the MIME types for PDF and PostScript.

        Additionally it is sufficient to implement MIMETypeRegistry::isSupportedImageResourceMIMEType() in terms
        of MIMETypeRegistry::isSupportedImageMIMEType() and MIMETypeRegistry::isPDFOrPostScriptMIMEType() instead
        of allocating a dedicated HashSet for the supported image resource MIME types (as we currently do).

        [Web Animations] CSSTransition objects should have fill: backwards to allow seeking prior to start time
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184129

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        In order to allow a CSS Transition to be seeked prior to its start time, it needs to have its fill mode set
        to backwards. Adding code to set the fill mode in CSSTransition::initialize() yields early timing model
        invalidation and we could get in a situation where stylesWouldYieldNewCSSTransitionsBlendingKeyframes()
        was called before we had a chance to create blending keyframes for a CSS transitions, since the call
        to create blending keyframes is made after the call to initialize(), so we now cater for this case.

        [Web Animations] Correctly obtain the timing function for a given keyframe
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184146

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The way we would get the timing function for a given KeyframeValue stored in a KeyframeList was really suboptimal.
        When keyframes were created, we would set the animated element's style on each keyframe, and set keyframe-specific
        properties and values on top. When figuring out the timing function for a KeyframeValue, we would look at its render
        style, go through its list of animations, which could include animations that are irrelevant to this specific keyframe
        list since all animations from the animated element are referenced, and we would have to look up the correct animation
        by name and get the timing function, even though the timing function stored on the animation was now specific to this
        particular keyframe.

        We now simply set a m_timingFunction member on a KeyframeValue, which is null if no explicit animation-timing-function
        was provided for this keyframe in CSS, and otherwise set to a valid TimingFunction.

        This fixes our behavior for a 4 existing animation tests when opted into the CSS Animations and CSS Transitions as
        Web Animations feature.

        Thread safety issue in IDBFactory' shouldThrowSecurityException()

        shouldThrowSecurityException() gets called on a non-main thread but
        it ended up using the SchemeRegistry via SecurityOrigin::canAccessDatabase()
        which calls SecurityOrigin::isLocal().

        Since using the SchemeRegistry from the background thread is not safe
        (we recently added locks which we're trying to remove), and since SecurityOrigin
        methods are often called from background threads, this patch make SecurityOrigin::isLocal()
        safe to call from a background thread. To achieve this, we now query the SchemeRegistry
        in the SecurityOrigin constructor instead as SecurityOrigin objects are expected to be
        constructed on the main thread.

        In r228697, we introduced a new set of boosted text autosizing constants tuned for extra zoom mode, which are
        currently hard-coded as default values in SettingsBase. However, we've since identified cases where clients may
        want to opt in or out of boosted text autosizing values and just use the existing values.

        This replaces settings to adjust text autosizing constants with a flag to enable or disable boosted text
        autosizing; when changed, we update all three text autosizing parameters to their default or boosted values, and
        then trigger style recalculation.

        It is possible for mach_port_allocate to return an error, but we rarely check its return value. The value
        of the argument passed to mach_port_allocate is not guaranteed to be valid when it returns an error, so
        there is a potential for us to try to use invalid ports.

        We should always check return values, and ensure that the mach port variables we seek to initialize are
        kept in a valid state.

        The test is timing out when we do not interact directly with the WindowServer, causing
        OpenGL to fall back to software rendering. In this mode, any call to CGLChoosePixelFormat
        requesting an accelerated pixel format will fail because it cannot determine which GPU is
        connected to the display.

        OpenGL treats all GPUs as if they were offline when used in a process (like the WebContent
        process) that does not directly control the display.

        We can get correct behavior if we tell OpenGL which GPU is currently connected to the
        display, and if we instruct CGLChoosePixelFormat to create an offline renderer pixel format
        by including the 'kCGLPFAAllowOfflineRenderers' flag in its arguments.

        We can use CGLSetVirtualScreen with an OpenGL display mask that tells the OpenGL framework
        which GPU it should use.

        This patch does the following few things:
        1) It implements the spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#op-get-assertion as of 5 December 2017.
        2) It tweaks encoding/decoding of PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions such that options can be passed
        between UI and Web processes.
        3) It refines the way how LocalAuthenticator::makeCredential find intersection between
        excludeCredentialDescriptorList and existing credentials in the authenticator, such that it is faster.
        Basically, it takes the CredentialID from the list and treat it as an ASCII string and put it into a
        HashSet<String>. It should not matter if a duplicated CredentialID is added. If the hash set is not
        empty, the algorithm then queries Keychain for all CredentialIDs related to the current RP ID once.
        For every queried CredentialID, the algorithm then treats it as an ASCII string as well and look for
        a match in the hash set to produce the intersetction. The new way is also employed in
        LocalAuthenticator::getAssertion as well.
        4) It abstracts the way to produce authData and thus reorders a bit of code in
        LocalAuthenticator::makeCredential.

        CSS mask images should be retrieved using potentially CORS-enabled fetch
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179983
        <rdar://problem/35678149>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        As per <https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/#priv-sec> (Editor’s Draft, 23 December 2017)
        we should fetch CSS mask images using a potentially CORS-enabled fetch.

        Both cross-origin CSS shape-outside images and CSS mask images may be sensitive to timing
        attacks that can be used to reveal their pixel data when retrieved without regard to CORS.
        For the same reason that we fetch CSS shape-outside images using a potentially CORS-enabled
        fetch we should fetch CSS mask the same way. This also makes the behavior of WebKit more
        closely align with the behavior in the spec.

        Test: http/tests/security/css-mask-image.html

        * page/Settings.yaml: Add a setting for toggle "Anonymous" mode fetching of mask images (defaults: true).
        We need this setting to avoid breaking the developer convenience feature that some modern media controls
        layout tests employ to load assets from the filesystem as opposed to using the hardcoded data URLs baked
        into the WebKit binary.
        * style/StylePendingResources.cpp: Substitute LoadPolicy::NoCORS and LoadPolicy::Anonymous for
        LoadPolicy::Normal and LoadPolicy::ShapeOutside, respectively, to match the terminology used
        in the HTML, CSS Shapes Module Level 1, and CSS Masking Module Level 1 specs.
        (WebCore::Style::loadPendingImage): Ditto.
        (WebCore::Style::loadPendingResources): Use load policy LoadPolicy::Anonymous when fetching
        a mask image or shape-outside image.

        We cannot rely on the correctness of the render tree structure when querying for parent/child/next and previous
        sibling since some features (multicolumn/spanners) move subtrees out of their original position (which is highly
        undesired and should not be encouraged at all though).
        It should also be noted that these functions are not equivalent of typeOfChildren<RenderBox> and the following usage
            for (auto* boxChild = firstChildBox(); boxChild; boxChild = boxChild->nextSiblingBox())

        [Web Animations] Correctly handle timing functions specified by CSS Animations and CSS Transitions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183935

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We were incorrectly reflecting the animation-timing-function and transition-timing-function values on the generated
        DeclarativeAnimation effect timing "easing" property. In fact, those values should only be represented on the keyframes.

        In the case of a CSS Animation, the animation-timing-function property set on the element's style serves as the default
        value used for all keyframes, and individual keyframes can specify an overriding animation-timing-function. For a CSS
        Transition, the transition-timing-function property set on the element's style serves as the timing function of the
        from keyframe.

        To correctly reflect this, we provide a new timingFunctionForKeyframeAtIndex() function on KeyframeEffectReadOnly
        which will return the right TimingFunction object at a given index, regardless of the animation type. In the case
        of getKeyframes(), we manually return "linear" for the "to" keyframe since timingFunctionForKeyframeAtIndex()
        would otherwise return the same timing function as the "from" keyframe. This avoids creating an extra
        LinearTimingFunction object.

        As a result, a number of Mozilla imported tests progress since we have correct information on the "easing" property
        of objects returned by getKeyframes() and the "progress" reported by getComputedTiming() now always uses a linear
        timing function.

        Use SecurityOriginData more consistently in Service Worker code to avoid constructing

        I also updated SecurityOrigin to use SecurityOriginData as a data member. This reduces

        Use SecurityOriginData more consistently in Service Worker code
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183969

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Use SecurityOriginData more consistently in Service Worker code to avoid constructing
        SecurityOrigin objects unnecessarily.

        I also updated SecurityOrigin to use SecurityOriginData as a data member. This reduces
        code duplication a bit. This also avoids constructing SecurityOriginData unnecessarily
        in some cases as callers can now use SecurityOrigin::data() instead of
        SecurityOriginData::fromSecurityOrigin().

        No new tests, no Web-facing behavior change.

        [Extra zoom mode] Fix some localizable strings after r229878
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183963

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The WEB_UI_STRING macro was incorrectly used for certain localized strings pertaining to extra zoom mode. To
        correct this, make the "Done" string use WEB_UI_STRING with actual UI-facing text; since day, year and month
        labels in the date picker are less generalizable to other UI, leave these as unique keys, but change them to
        use WEB_UI_STRING_KEY instead.

        Additionally, remove now-unused localizable strings for the text input view controller.

        NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateWithoutNotifying() is inefficient
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183760
        <rdar://problem/37093299>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Update NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateWithoutNotifying() to stop calling
        SCDynamicStoreCopyKeyList(). SCDynamicStoreCopyKeyList() is expensive as it
        expects its key parameter to be a regular expression and it can match several
        keys. It is also unnecessary in our case since we already have an exact key.
        We now call the more efficient SCDynamicStoreCopyValue() instead, which is
        the right thing to call when we have an exact key.

        This change was suggested by the SC team.

        This was tested manually as there is no easy way to write an automated test
        for this.

        In a follow-up, I also plan to call this code in the UIProcess (or NetworkProcess)
        to avoid calling it once per WebProcess.

        [Web Animations] Animated transform styles are ignored when calling getComputedStyle()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183918

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Strictly looking at whether the renderer has a transform is a bad idea when determining whether a
        transform is applied for an element. Looking at the RenderStyle is preferable because in the case
        of animations running on the compositor, such as a transform-only animation or transition, the
        renderer doesn't necessarily have a transform style on it, since we don't blend properties in
        software as the animation progresses. Instead, all of the blending is performed by the compositor,
        and only the computed style object has the software-blended transform style on it.

        We do need to account for inline renderers though as these do not support transforms.

        We now support "transition: all" CSS Transitions by iterating over all known CSS properties should the mode
        of the backing animation be AnimateAll. Any property that we find to have a different value in the previous
        and current style will have a backing CSSTransition object created for it. To support this, we now explicitly
        provide a CSSPropertyID when creating a CSSTransition since we can no longer infer the transition property
        from the backing animation, as Animation objects with mode AnimateAll report CSSPropertyInvalid as their
        property.

        (WebCore::shouldBackingAnimationBeConsideredForCSSTransition): New method that checks whether a given backing
        Animation object is suitable for consideration as a CSSTransition, where the mode must not be either AnimateNone

        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::updateCSSTransitionsForElement): We now assemble the list of previously animated
        properties by looking at the m_elementToCSSTransitionByCSSPropertyID map and getting its keys. Then we compile

        shouldBackingAnimationBeConsideredForCSSTransition(). Then as we iterate over backing Animation objects found
        in the new style, we iterate over all known CSS properties if the mode is AnimateAll, indicating that we're dealing
        with a "transition: all" style. If we're dealing with a single property, we only process that single property.

        we should fetch CSS mask images using a potentially CORS-enabled fetch.

        Both cross-origin CSS shape-outside images and CSS mask images may be sensitive to timing
        attacks that can be used to reveal their pixel data when retrieved without regard to CORS.
        For the same reason that we fetch CSS shape-outside images using a potentially CORS-enabled
        fetch we should fetch CSS mask the same way. This also makes the behavior of WebKit more
        closely align with the behavior in the spec.

        [TexMap] Make TextureMapperContextAttributes thread-specific

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Store the TextureMapperContextAttributes in a thread-specific manner.
        The TextureMapperContextAttributes::get() method is now used to retrieve
        a reference to that thread-specific object. If it's not been initialized
        yet, then the current GL context is used for the initialization, as it
        used to be done in the now-removed initialize() method.

        TextureMapperPlatformLayerBuffer::clone() method now doesn't need to
        be passed a TextureMapperGL object, since the texture can be created
        directly by calling BitmapTextureGL::create(), passing the
        TextureMapperContextAttributes object that's retrieved from the
        thread-specific storage. This further simplifies the
        TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy::Compositor interface, removing the

        SVG root is skipped while marking percentage height descendants dirty.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183877

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Calling continingBlock() to get to the correct container works as long as the ancestor inline element
        renderers are wrapped in anonymous blocks (continuation for example).

        While the SVG root renderer is an inline renderer, it is not wrapped or normalized in any way,
        so containingBlock() will elegantly skip it and return an SVG root ancestor.
        dirtyForLayoutFromPercentageHeightDescendants calls containingBlock() to walk up
        on the ancestor chain to mark elements dirty. This fails when there's an SVG subtree in the block chain.
        This patch marks the SVG subtree chain dirty to ensure that layout will get to all the dirty leaf renderers 
        (note that the SVG subtree is supposed to have only statically positioned elements so parent == containing block).

        Covered by existing tests.

        [Web Animations] Ensure animationcancel and transitioncancel events are dispatched
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183864

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        In order to correctly dispatch animationcancel and transitioncancel events, we must call cancel() on CSSAnimation and CSSTransitions
        objects that are removed while in a play or pause phase. Additionally, we cancel declarative animations that are moving from a valid
        to a null timeline. Finally, when cancel() is called on a declarative animation, we record the timestamp and manually call
        invalidateDOMEvents() passing that timestamp in to ensure that the right phase change is recorded and results in the queuing of
        animationcancel and transitioncancel events.

        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::updateCSSAnimationsForElement): Make sure we cancel all recorded CSS Animations when we newly get a
        "display: none" style. We also call the new cancelOrRemoveDeclarativeAnimation() method, instead of removing animations outright,

        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::updateCSSTransitionsForElement): Like in updateCSSAnimationsForElement(), we cancel all recorded CSS
        Transitions when we newly get a "display: none" style. We now use the refactored removeDeclarativeAnimation() method to remove an

        like in updateCSSAnimationsForElement(), we call the new cancelOrRemoveDeclarativeAnimation() method, instead of removing transitions
        outright, for all transitions that previously existed but are no longer listed in the current style.

        [Web Animations] Dispatch DOM events for CSS Transitions and CSS Animations implemented as Web Animations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183781

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Now that we've implemented CSS Animations and CSS Transitions as Web Animations (webkit.org/b/183504) we can dispatch DOM events
        for targets of DeclarativeAnimation objects. To do that, we add a new invalidateDOMEvents() method on DeclarativeAnimations which
        is called when the timer scheduled after the timing model has been invalidated fires in DocumentTimeline::performInvalidationTask().
        When we check for DOM events to dispatch, we look at the last recorded phase and iteration and determine whether the state of the
        animation has changed. We use a GenericEventQueue to enqueue the events such that they are dispatched asynchronously at a moment
        when it is safe to evaluate script.

        * animation/AnimationEffectReadOnly.h: Make currentIteration() public since we now need it in DeclarativeAnimation::invalidateDOMEvents().
        * animation/CSSAnimation.cpp:
        (WebCore::CSSAnimation::create): Pass the animation target to the constructor instead of its document.

        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::~DeclarativeAnimation): Close the GenericEventQueue member upon destruction.
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::initialize): We need to call pause() for declarative animations that aren't playing so that the animation's
        playState is set correctly and the animation is not idle.
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::phaseWithoutEffect const): Because we may need to get an animation's current phase in invalidateDOMEvents()
        after an animation's effect has been removed, we provide an alternate way to compute the phase just by looking at the animation's current time.
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::invalidateDOMEvents): Based on the previous and current pending state, iteration and phase, we enqueue animation
        and transition DOM events as specified by the CSS Animations Level 2 and CSS Transitions Level 2 specifications.

        [CoordGraphics] Track dirty rects that need update in CoordinatedGraphicsLayer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175376

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Follow the GraphicsLayerCA class and track rectangles in need of display
        in a Vector object. In case the whole layer needs updating, it's marked
        separately, and further rects are ignored.

        During layer flush, all the rects are used to invalidate the backing
        store, or a single layer-sized rect is used in case the whole layer has
        to be updated. We can also bail early from updateContentBuffers() if
        there are no dirty rects recorded and there's no pending visible rect
        adjustment.

        At the end of updateContentBuffers() we now test for an existing
        previous backing store before inquiring the backing store if the visible
        area is already covered, enabling deletion of this backing store.

        The issue is that the test calls loadHTMLString then loadRequest right after, without
        waiting for the first load to complete first. loadHTMLString is special as it relies
        on substitute data and which schedules a timer to commit the data. When doing the
        navigation policy check for the following loadRequest(), the substitute data timer
        would fire and commit its data and load. This would in turn cancel the pending
        navigation policy check for the loadRequest().

        With sync policy delegates, this is not an issue because we take care of stopping
        all loaders when receiving the policy decision, which happens synchronously. However,
        when the policy decision happens asynchronously, the pending substitute data load
        does not get cancelled in time and it gets committed.

        To address the issue, we now cancel any pending provisional load before doing the
        navigation policy check.

        needs to be here rather than in the call site of policyChecker().checkNavigationPolicy()
        because there is code in PolicyChecker::checkNavigationPolicy() which relies on
        FrameLoader::activeDocumentLoader().
        Also, we only cancel the provisional load if there is a policy document loader. In some
        rare cases (when we receive a redirect after navigation policy has been decided for the
        initial request), the provisional document loader needs to receive navigation policy
        decisions so we cannot clear the provisional document loader in such case.

        When the WebContent process is blocked from accessing the WindowServer, the call CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplay will fail.

        The call to CVDisplayLinkCreateWithCGDisplay can instead be made in the UIProcess. Notify the WebContent process
        about display updates by sending a message from the UIProcess on each screen update. This patch adds an extra
        IPC step when notifying the WebContent process about display updates. However, the MotionMark benchmark shows no
        performance regression when running it with this patch. A possible explanation for this is that the high priority
        display link thread is now running in the UIProcess instead of the WebContent process, which means there will be
        more available CPU resources for the WebContent process. A run loop observer is added to make sure that only one
        display callback (for each display observer) is executed in a single iteration of the run loop. This will make
        sure we are not filling the IPC message queue with unhandled display link messages.

        No new tests, covered by existing tests.

        [WebAuthN] Implement authenticatorMakeCredential
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183527
        <rdar://problem/35275886>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        This patch does the following few things:
        1) It implements the authenticatorMakeCredential logic from the spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#op-make-cred.
        2) It tweaks enocding and deocding of PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions between UIProccess and WebProcess.
        3) It soft links LocalAuthentication.Framework to WebCore, which was linked to WebKit.
        4) It creates SPI header for DeviceIdentity.Framework, and provides stubs to link it to WebCore.

        Here is a detailed explanantion of 1):
        1. A helper class called LocalAuthenticator is crafted to represent Apple platform attached authenticator, i.e.
        the devices themselves. All operations are currently restricted to iOS at this moment as macOS lacks attestation
        support.
        2. To do testing, this helper class is then moved from WebKit to WebCore even though all operations can only happens
        in the UIProcess. We currently lack the ability to pretend a https environment in TestWebKitAPI which is required by
        the WebAuthN API, and thus it is moved to WebCore to perform unit tesing flavor API tests. This is not enough as it
        can't test message exchange between the UI and Web processes. We will address this in a subsequent patch.
        3. More on testing: The attestation process is abstracted into a protected method such that the testing enviroment can
        override it with self attestation as network access is restricted in the WebKit testing enviroment. Also, swizzlers of
        LocalAuthentication API are provided to override the behavoir of LAContext.
        4. More on testing: The actual Apple attestation can only happen in real device and with network access, therefore
        it can only be covered by manual tests at this moment.
        5. Back to LocalAuthenticator, it currently has two public methods:
                5.1. makeCredential(): This method is the one does all the magic.
                + It first checks some parameters.
                + It then invokes LAContext to get user consent.
                + It then talks to Apple Attestation Privacy CA to do attestations.
                + It then stores necessary information into the Keychain.
                + Finally it generates the attestation object.
                5.2 isAvailable():
                To check if a LocalAuthenticator is available or not.
        6. Even though files are of .mm format, they are written in a way that mixes NS, CF and C++ types. Here is the rule:
                6.1 Use CF type only if it is requested by APIs.
                6.2 Use NS type to manipulate all Objc objects.
                6.3 Use C++ otherwise.

        Covered by API tests.

        Put the DOM in IsoHeaps

        No new tests because no change in behavior.
        
        This puts all descendants of WebCore::Node in isoheaps, so that UAFs on the DOM cannot be
        used for RCE attacks. This probably also makes it harder to use UAFs for UXSS, since it means
        that DOM UAFs cannot be used for universal read gadgets.
        
        This looks neutral on Speedometer and membuster, though I did have one round of testing
        that led me to believe that membuster was regressed - I just wasn't able to reproduce that
        result on subsequent testing.

        WebKit.WebsitePoliciesAutoplayQuirks API test times out with async policy delegates
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183702

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        The issue is that the test calls loadHTMLString then loadRequest right after, without
        waiting for the first load to complete first. loadHTMLString is special as it relies
        on substitute data and which schedules a timer to commit the data. When doing the
        navigation policy check for the following loadRequest(), the substitute data timer
        would fire and commit its data and load. This would in turn cancel the pending
        navigation policy check for the loadRequest().

        With sync policy delegates, this is not an issue because we take care of stopping
        all loaders when receiving the policy decision, which happens synchronously. However,
        when the policy decision happens asynchronously, the pending substitute data load
        does not get cancelled in time and it gets committed.

        To address the issue, this patch updates loadWithDocumentLoader() to cancel any
        provisional load when there is an asynchronous navigation policy decision pending.

        Change covered by new API test.

        [Nicosia] Add Cairo-specific GraphicsContext operation recorder
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183593

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Add Nicosia::CairoOperationRecorder, GraphicsContextImpl implementation
        that records all GraphicsContext operations for deferred replay on a
        different thread. Recording here mostly consists of storing all the
        Cairo resources in a thread-safe manner, which is eased by the atomic
        reference counting used in Cairo.

        Nicosia::PaintingOperation derivatives are used for operations or state
        updates that require recording. Instances of these classes are appended
        to a Vector<> object that is then pushed into a thread pool in
        Nicosia::PaintingEngineThreaded , replaying all the operations against
        the Cairo context established from an associated target Nicosia::Buffer.

        This GraphicsContextImpl implementation is now used in the
        PaintingContextCairo::ForRecording constructor to construct the
        GraphicsContext implementation that will be used for recording.

        [TexMap] Don't use the TextureMapperAnimation::Client interface to apply animation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183656

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Don't have the TextureMapperLayer class inherit from the
        TextureMapperAnimation::Client interface just for the purposes of
        synchronization of animation-affected attributes in syncAnimations().
        For that purpose it's enough to provide a struct that is passed to that
        method, and with the TextureMapperAnimation class filling out any of the
        animated attributes that need to be updated.

        TextureMapperAnimation::ApplicationResult struct is introducted for that
        purpose. std::optional<> members in it are assigned values during the
        application process, if an appropriate animation affects them. The
        relevant member values in TextureMapperLayer are then updated, or value
        from the default state is used.

        TextureMapperAnimation::Client is removed.

        <rdar://problem/35175740>

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        When the main frame navigates, the DOMAgent would recieve two InspectorInstrumentation calls,
        one when the frame begins its navigation and the other when the document for that frame has
        loaded. Both of these would discard the DOMAgent's bindings, which included the map of
        `nodeId`s. This was an issue for canvases, as the frontend would be notified whenever any
        canvas is created, which would usually occur before the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired.
        As a result, the canvases would attempt to retrieve their associated node, only to have the
        DOMAgent discard those bindings quickly thereafter.

        This patch removes DOMAgent's and DOMDebuggerAgent's (parity) instrumentation hooks for the
        latter event, ensuring that the bindings are only discarded once.

        Add assertion to ensure MessagePort is destroyed in the right thread.
        Modify methods taking a ref in a lambda to rely on weak pointers and refing the WorkerThread if in a worker context.
        It is safe to ref the WorkerThread since it is thread safe ref counted and we are passing the ref to the main thread
        where the WorkerThread is expected to be destroyed.

        [Web Animations] Implement CSS Animations and CSS Transitions as Web Animations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183504
        <rdar://problem/38372965>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson and Jon Lee.

        Tests: webanimations/css-animations.html
               webanimations/css-transitions.html

        This patch implements CSS Animations and CSS Transitions as Web Animations. The main changes are:

        * StyleTreeResolver: StyleTreeResolver now has a code path to add CSSAnimation and CSSTransition objects onto the DocumentTimeline
        to be picked up by the Web Animations engine. The previous CSSAnimationController code path is preserved if the runtime flag is disabled.

        * AnimationTimeline: we add two new methods, updateCSSAnimationsForElement() and updateCSSTransitionsForElement() which are called from
        TreeResolver::createAnimatedElementUpdate(). These look at the AnimationList for the old and new RenderStyle objects and create, update
        and remove matching CSSAnimation and CSSTransition instances.

        * DeclarativeAnimation: a new superclass to both CSSAnimation and CSSTransition which introduces the concept of a backingAnimation(),
        which is an Animation held by the RenderStyle objects, and two virtual methods with base implementations, initialize() which is called
        upon creating by create() methods in subclasses, and syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation() which ensures that properties on the
        DeclarativeAnimation objects (Web Animations side) match the backing animation (CSS side).

        * KeyframeEffectReadOnly: two new important methods to create blending keyframes (KeyframeList) based on backing Animation objects,
        computeCSSAnimationBlendingKeyframes() and computeCSSTransitionBlendingKeyframes().

        * Sources.txt:
        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
        * animation/AnimationEffectReadOnly.h:
        (WebCore::AnimationEffectReadOnly::isKeyframeEffectReadOnly const): We fix this method such that calling it on a KeyframeEffect, which
        is a subclass of KeyframeEffectReadOnly, returns true.
        * animation/AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly.cpp: In order for DeclarativeAnimation::syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation() to set the timing
        function for a declarative animation's effect, we need a public method to set an effect's timing function outside of just the "easing"
        property setter exposed via the JS API. So we introduce a setTimingFunction() method and call it from setEasing().
        (WebCore::AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly::setEasing):
        (WebCore::AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly::setTimingFunction):
        * animation/AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly.h:
        * animation/AnimationTimeline.cpp:
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::~AnimationTimeline): Clear all maps and sets containing WebAnimation references to ensure these get destructed
        when the AnimationTimeline is being destructed and should no longer hold a reference to them.
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::relevantMapForAnimation): We store various subclasses of WebAnimation in dedicated maps so we can composite
        animations in the correct order when animating. This function returns the correct map for a given animation such that animationWasAddedToElement()
        and animationWasRemovedFromElement() mutate the right map.
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::animationWasAddedToElement):
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::animationWasRemovedFromElement):
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::animationsForElement): Make sure to look for animations in the lists of CSS Animations and CSS Transitions as well
        as Web Animations.
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::updateCSSAnimationsForElement): This method is called by TreeResolver::createAnimatedElementUpdate() during style
        resolution. It compares the AnimationList of the previous style and the new style for a given element, checks that animations with a given name
        that were not present in the old AnimationList have a new matching CSSAnimation object for them added to the AnimationTimeline, that animations
        with a given name that are no longer present in the new AnimationList have their matching CSSAnimation object removed from the AnimationTimeline,
        and that animations with a given name that are present in both the old and new AnimationList have their matching CSSAnimation updated to match
        the current state of the animation in the AnimationList.
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::updateCSSTransitionsForElement): Similarly to updateCSSAnimationsForElement(), this method is called during style
        resolution by TreeResolver::createAnimatedElementUpdate(). Its role is to create or remove CSSTransition objects based on the AnimationList found
        in the old and new styles for a given element. It follows a slightly different logic than updateCSSAnimationsForElement() since for CSS Transitions,
        there is no need to update CSSTransition objects for a CSS property existing in both the old and new AnimationList, since when a CSS transitions
        property is changed, a whole new transition is initiated. However, it's important to check that different Animation objects and styles would actually
        result in different timing properties and blending keyframes, so check for this as well before creating new CSSTransition objects.
        * animation/AnimationTimeline.h:
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::animations const): Change the m_animations type from HashSet to ListHashSet to guarantee we preserve the insertion order which is
        required by getAnimations().
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::hasElementAnimations const): Indicates to DocumentTimeline::updateAnimations() that there are animations targeting the provided element.
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::elementToAnimationsMap):
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::elementToCSSAnimationsMap):
        (WebCore::AnimationTimeline::elementToCSSTransitionsMap):
        * animation/CSSAnimation.cpp: CSSAnimation is now a subclass of DeclarativeAnimation and subclasses initialize() and syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation()
        to perform work specific to CSS Animations.
        (WebCore::CSSAnimation::create): Set the animationName property based on the provided backing animation.
        (WebCore::CSSAnimation::CSSAnimation):
        (WebCore::CSSAnimation::initialize): Create the blending keyframes for this CSSAnimation.
        (WebCore::CSSAnimation::syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation): Reflect the animation-fill-mode, animation-direction, animation-iteration-count and
        animation-play-state CSS properties on the AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly object associated with this CSSAnimation.
        * animation/CSSAnimation.h:
        * animation/CSSTransition.cpp: CSSTransition is now a subclass of DeclarativeAnimation.
        (WebCore::CSSTransition::create): Set the transitionProperty property based on the provided backing animation.
        (WebCore::CSSTransition::CSSTransition):
        (WebCore::CSSTransition::matchesBackingAnimationAndStyles const):
        (WebCore::CSSTransition::canBeListed const): Subclass this method such that we also check that we have blending keyframes for a CSSTransition to be
        listed by calls to getAnimations().
        * animation/CSSTransition.h:
        * animation/DeclarativeAnimation.cpp: Added. This new WebAnimation subclass now is the common base class for both CSSAnimation and CSSTransition.
        It establishes a relationship with a "backing animation", which is an Animation obtained from a style's AnimationList while resolving styles.
        These backing animations contain all of the parsed CSS styles related to CSS Animations and CSS Transitions and we use those to set matching properties
        of the Web Animations timing model in the new syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation() virtual method, which subclasses can override to perform further
        work that is specific to a given declarative animation type. The initialize() method is called during create() methods to perform common animation
        setup work. Note that while both initialize() and syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation() are called, we suspend invalidation to that animation's effect
        since these methods are meant to be called during style invalidation and we would hit an assertion if we followed the usual route of calling
        updateStyleIfNeeded() on the target's document during invalidation.
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::DeclarativeAnimation):
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::setBackingAnimation):
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::initialize): Create a KeyframeEffectReadOnly for this animation and set the provided element as its target, set that
        element's document's timeline and play the animation if the backing animation's play state is playing.
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::syncPropertiesWithBackingAnimation): Reflect the {animation|transition}-delay, {animation|transition}-duration and
        {animation|transition}-timing-function properties as set on the backing animation.
        * animation/DeclarativeAnimation.h: Added.
        (WebCore::DeclarativeAnimation::backingAnimation const):
        * animation/DocumentTimeline.cpp:
        (WebCore::DocumentTimeline::updateAnimations): Trigger style invalidation for elements targeted not just by WebAnimation instances, but also by any
        of the DeclarativeAnimation subclasses. We also remove the call to updateFinishedState() which should have been removed when we implemented correct
        support for asynchronous WebAnimation operations.
        (WebCore::DocumentTimeline::animatedStyleForRenderer): Declarative animations are backed by KeyframeEffectReadOnly effects, so make sure we check
        for KeyframeEffectReadOnly or one of its subclasses and not just KeyframeEffect since there now are animation types that use the ReadOnly variant.
        (WebCore::DocumentTimeline::runningAnimationsForElementAreAllAccelerated): Same as for animatedStyleForRenderer, check for KeyframeEffectReadOnly
        and not simply KeyframeEffect.
        * animation/KeyframeEffectReadOnly.cpp:
        (WebCore::invalidateElement): Stop forcing a style resolution as we invalidate element, marking them as dirty is sufficient. Calls to getAnimations()
        already force a style resolution as needed.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::create): Add a new create() method that only provides a target and which is used by DeclarativeAnimation::initialize().
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::getKeyframes): The previous implementation of getKeyframes() used the ParsedKeyframe list held as m_parsedKeyframes
        to compute keyframes. In the case of declarative animations, there are no ParsedKeyframe since the JS API was not involved, so we use the blending keyframes
        to look for keyframe data.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::computeCSSAnimationBlendingKeyframes): Called by CSSAnimation::initialize(), this function creates blending keyframes by
        looking up the keyframes date obtained from the @keyframes rule with this backing animation's name.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::computeCSSTransitionBlendingKeyframes): Called by CSSTransition::create(), this function creates blending keyframes by
        creating a 0-offset keyframe with the old style and a 1-offset keyframe with the new style as provided during TreeResolver::createAnimatedElementUpdate().
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::stylesWouldYieldNewCSSTransitionsBlendingKeyframes const): Called by AnimationTimeline::updateCSSTransitionsForElement()
        to check that a provided backing Animation and a pair of old and new RenderStyles that may be different objects actually would yield different timing
        properties and keyframe CSS values for a given CSS transition to avoid the deletion and creation of CSSTransition objects.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::shouldRunAccelerated): We mistakenly assumed we always had blending keyframes, which is not always the case with a
        CSSTransition where the transition style itself might be set first, but the target value after. So we should only run accelerated provided there are blending
        keyframes at least, the function already returning false if it finds a blending keyframe animating a non-accelerated CSS property.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::setAnimatedPropertiesInStyle): Check that there actually is a matching ParsedKeyframe to read the timing function from.
        * animation/KeyframeEffectReadOnly.h:
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::hasBlendingKeyframes const):
        * animation/WebAnimation.cpp:
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::~WebAnimation): We used to do something very wrong when a WebAnimation was destroyed which uncovered crashes when dealing with
        declarative animations. In AnimationTimeline's updateCSSAnimationsForElement() and updateCSSTransitionsForElement(), when we identify that a DeclarativeAnimation
        no longer matches an Animation from the current style's AnimationList, we set that DeclarativeAnimation's effect to null and call removeAnimation() on
        the timeline. This removes all references from AnimationTimeline to this DeclarativeAnimation and leads to ~WebAnimation being called. Calling removeAnimation()
        again in the destructor means that we'd hit ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION(!m_deletionHasBegun) in ref(). It was also meaningless to perform this work in
        the WebAnimation destructor since an animation could never be destroyed if it were still registered on a timeline.
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::suspendEffectInvalidation): DeclarativeAnimation instances have their timing model properties set during style invalidation, so we need
        a mechanism to allow the usual effect invalidation to be suspended in this case. We now maintain a simple m_suspendCount count that increases and decreases with
        calls to this method and unsuspendEffectInvalidation() and a isEffectInvalidationSuspended() method returning true whenever that count is positive.
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::unsuspendEffectInvalidation):
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::timingModelDidChange): Check that effect invalidation is not suspended before proceeding with invalidating the effect.

        We normally ensure clean tree before calling offsetHeight/Width, scrollHeight/Width.
        In certain cases (see updateLayoutIfDimensionsOutOfDate() for details), it's okay to return
        the previously computed values even when some part of the tree is dirty.
        In case of shadow content, updateLayoutIfDimensionsOutOfDate() might return false (no need to layout)
        for the root, while true (needs layout) for the shadow content.

        [macOS] Copying a table from the Numbers app and pasting into iCloud Numbers fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183485
        <rdar://problem/38041984>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        After r222656, WebKit now treats raw image data on the pasteboard as files for the purposes of computing
        DataTransfer.files and DataTransfer.types. However, this is combined with existing policies that suppress
        DataTransfer.getData and DataTransfer.setData when the pasteboard contains files (generalized to copy/paste in
        r222688). This means we now don't allow web pages to access "text/plain" in the case where the user copies part
        of a table from the native Numbers app since Numbers additionally writes a snapshot of the table to the platform
        pasteboard.

        This restriction on getData/setData was intended to prevent web pages from extracting users' file paths when
        pasting or dropping, so it doesn't make sense to enforce this restriction even when there is only in-memory
        image data on the pasteboard. To fix this bug, we make Pasteboard::fileContentState() differentiate between
        cases where there are (real) files on the pasteboard, and cases where we've fallen back to treating image data
        as files.

        Rebaselined existing LayoutTests to match new behavior.
        Also covered by 4 new API tests:
            - PasteMixedContent.ImageDataAndPlainText
            - PasteMixedContent.ImageDataAndPlainTextAndURL
            - PasteMixedContent.ImageDataAndPlainTextAndURLAndHTML

        (WebCore::DataTransfer::shouldSuppressGetAndSetDataToAvoidExposingFilePaths const):

        If custom pasteboard data is enabled, suppress getData and setData if and only if we might actually expose file
        paths (see Pasteboard::fileContentState).

        (WebCore::DataTransfer::types const):

        Only allow "text/html" or "text/uri-list" in the case where there are actual files in the pasteboard. If there's
        only image data, add all of the DOM-safe types back into the list of types.

        * platform/Pasteboard.h:
        * platform/StaticPasteboard.h:

        Add an enum type to represent the result of Pasteboard::fileContentState.
        -   NoFileOrImageData indicates that there was nothing on the pasteboard that could be considered a file
            from the point of view of the page.
        -   InMemoryImage indicates that there are no files on the pasteboard, but there is image data that we consider
            to be files, exposed via DataTransfer API.
        -   MayContainFilePaths indicates that there might be file paths on the pasteboard. This means that the source
            has either written file paths to the pasteboard (for example, through NSFilenamesPboardType) or the source
            has written image data along with a URL type of some sort that does not match one of the allowed URL schemes

        calling method originates in the UIProcess. For WebKit1 clients (and WKTR and DRT), there's the possibility that
        webkitWillEnterFullScreenForElement will be called synchronously from within
        Document::requestFullScreenForElement(), so break that synchronousness by starting the
        ChromeClient::enterFullScreenForElement(...) process in a async task.

        Previously, the firing of the fullscreenchange event was done through a zero-length timer. Use a
        GenericTaskQueue instead.

        A number of layout tests depend on the behavior that the element will be in fullscreen when the 'playing' event
        fires. This was true for DRT (but not WKTR), since its fullscreen implementations were deliberately synchronous, but
        won't necessarily be true for all ports. Fix this in a subsequent patch.

        [Nicosia] Add threaded PaintingEngine implementation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183511

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Add Nicosia::PaintingEngineThreaded, class that internally uses a thread
        pool in which painting tasks are executed.

        Implementation for now defaults to using GLib's GThreadPool, defaulting
        to 4 threads that are exclusive to this pool. These parameters should be
        fine-tuned in the future, or even made configurable, but are a solid
        basis for testing.

        In PaintingEngineThreaded::paint(), PaintingContext implementation is
        used to record all the operations, and the gathered Vector is combined
        with the Buffer object and dispatched into the thread pool. In the
        thread function, the provided buffer and painting operations are run
        through the PaintingContext implementation, replaying all the operations
        on a painting context that draws into the given buffer.

        The recorded operation objects implement the PaintingOperation interface
        contain all the data necessary to replay a given operation. They can be
        executed against a PaintingOperationReplay object, as is the case during
        PaintingContext::replay(), or they can be dumped into a TextStream
        object for debugging purposes.

        PaintingContext now also provides the record() and replay() static
        functions. PaintingContext objects now differ per purpose, which can be
        either for painting or for recording. paint() and replay() use a
        for-painting PaintingContext, and record() uses a for-recording one.
        The for-painting PaintingContext receives a Buffer object, i.e. a memory
        area on which it can draw, while the for-recording PaintingContext uses
        the passed-in PaintingOperations Vector that should store all the
        recorded operations.

        The current Cairo implementation of PaintingContext is moved into
        PaintingContextCairo::ForPainting. PaintingContextCairo::ForRecording is
        added but is currently no-op until a Cairo-specific GraphicsContextImpl
        with recording capabilities is added, allowing any call on the
        GraphicsContext object used in PaintingContext::record() to be recorded
        for later replay. PaintingOperationReplayCairo, inheriting from
        PaintingOperationReplay, will be used for replay purposes, providing
        only reference to the PlatformContextCairo object that is constructed in
        PaintingContextCairo::ForPainting.

        The Cairo-specific GraphicsContextImpl implementation will be added in
        a separate patch. After that, PaintingEngine::create() will be modified
        so that the Nicosia::PaintingEngineThreaded implementation can be used
        for testing purposes, probably by setting an environment variable.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Have Nicosia::Buffer track a painting state, and allow that state to be
        modified and accessed from different threads. The PaintingState enum
        value is protected by a Lock object, and can be modified via the
        beginPainting() and completePainting() methods. Additionally, the
        waitUntilPaintingComplete() method allows the caller to wait until the
        painting is complete for the given Nicosia::Buffer object.

        This added state doesn't affect a Nicosia::Buffer object internally, and
        doesn't have any effect on  existing usages of Nicosia::Buffer (which
        are not multi-threaded).

        Replace the union by a Variant. Replace all the type specific functions

        [JSC][WebCore] Extend jsDynamicCast for WebCore types in WebCore and remove jsDynamicDowncast
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183449

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        This patch removes jsDynamicDowncast. Our JSC::jsDynamicCast can have a way to inject a fast
        path that is similar to jsDynamicDowncast. WebCore can leverage this functionality to add
        a fast path for WebCore's extended JS object types (JSEvent, JSElement, JSNode, and JSDocument).

        No behavior change.

        When HTMLInputElement::updateType() is called with a dirty value, we eagerly change the m_inputType first
        and then we take care of the dirty value by calling setAttributeWithoutSynchronization().
        With a DOMSubtreeModified event listener attached, setAttributeWithoutSynchronization() can end up running some
        layout code (offsetHeight) with a renderer - m_inputType mismatch.

        This patch ensures that we don't change the m_inputType until after we finished setting the new value.

        Move from an origin-keyed map to a vector of plugins.
        We iterate through the vector and a match happens if the page host name ends with the provided matching domain.
        This allows supporting rules for *.mydomain.com by passing 'mydomain.com'.

        Relayout frames after AsyncFrameScrolling or FrameFlattening option is changed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183081

        Reviewed by Antonio Gomes.

        The frames may be resized when the FrameFlattening option is modified and hence this patch
        forces a relayout. It also does that when AsyncFrameScrolling is modified too, since that
        may imply changes in frame flattening after bug 173704. Forcing a relayout will also be
        enough to trigger other updates for async frame scrolling in the future (see bug 149264 and
        bug 171667).

        fast/loader/redirect-to-invalid-url-using-meta-refresh-disallowed.html fails with async policy delegates
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183345

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        FrameLoader::loadURL() was calling loadWithNavigationAction() and then resetting the
        m_quickRedirectComing flag right after. This works if the navigation policy decision
        triggered by loadWithNavigationAction() is made synchronously. However, when it is
        made asynchronously, the flag gets reset too early, before the policy decision
        handler has been called. This is an issue because the policy decision handler
        relies on the m_quickRedirectComing flag.

        Similarly, FrameLoader::loadFrameRequest() was calling loadPostRequest() / loadURL()
        and then focusing a frame right after. This does not work as intended when the navigation
        policy decision is made asynchronously.

        To address the issue, we now pass a completion handler that gets called when the operation
        has actually completion, after the policy decision has been made. This maintains the
        behavior in place with synchronous policy delegates.

        [Mac] Teach WebCore::Pasteboard about file promise drags
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183314
        <rdar://problem/38105493>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        While WebKit does support receiving file promise drags (since r210360), WebCore::Pasteboard
        has not been instructed on how to read their file paths. When the various pasteboard readers
        ask for file paths after a file promise drop, they receive an empty vector. This impacts
        various features, most notably the DataTransfer API.

        Pasteboard actually cannot learn about promised file paths from the pasteboard itself, as
        the pasteboard only contains the dragged files' UTIs. Promised file paths aren't known until
        the WebKits call -[NSFilePromiseReceiver receivePromisedFilesAtDestination:...], at which
        point the file paths are passed to WebCore as part of WebCore::DragData.

        When we construct new Pasteboards for drag and drop, we need to store any promised file
        paths from the DragData. Then, when the various pasteboard readers ask for file paths and
        NSFilesPromisePboardType is on the pasteboard, we can return these promised file paths.

        When a FrameLoader's policy document loader is cleared after receiving a navigation policy decision
        to not continue loading, we still need to trigger a check for load completion, since this loader or

        Drop code that was added to SubresourceLoader::willCancel() in r228852. The purpose of this code
        was to make sure that SubresourceLoader::m_policyForResponseCompletionHandler always gets called,
        even when the load is cancelled. However, this code is not needed (since m_policyForResponseCompletionHandler
        is a CompletionHandler, an assertion will be hit if we fail to call it and we'll know). Calling
        the completionHandler inside SubresourceLoader::willCancel() is too early and leads to crashes.

        The completionHandler currently gets called DocumentLoader::responseReceived() via a call to
        mainResourceLoader->didReceiveResponsePolicy(). Note that in r229177, we made sure that the
        call to didReceiveResponsePolicy() happens *after* the call to continueAfterContentPolicy()
        to maintain our non-async policy delegate behavior. However, continueAfterContentPolicy()
        would end up calling willCancel() and call the completionHandler when shouldContinue was
        false.

        When the navigation policy happens asynchronously, it is now possible for the
        Frame / FrameLoader to get destroyed between the point that policyChecker().checkNavigationPolicy()
        is called and when continueLoadAfterNavigationPolicy() is called.

        To address the issue, we now protect the Frame and capture it in the lambda passed

        REGRESSION(r222843): [HarfBuzz] Combining enclosed keycap not correctly handled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183246

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        We are not correctly handling the combining enclosed keycap since we switched to use
        ComplexTextController. This is because fontForCombiningCharacterSequence() always returns the font of the first
        character, without checking if that font can render the whole sequence or not. Before 222843, the shaper did
        that check when creating the text runs. In this case the sequence was split and a different font was used for the
        text and the mark. This patch makes fontForCombiningCharacterSequence() try to find a suitable font for the
        whole sequence, first looking at the CSS fallbacks and finally at system ones. The result is much better than
        the old one, because we use the same font for both the text and the mark. If there isn't any font to render the
        mark, then we fallback to use the first character font, since we will end up rendering the missing glyph
        character, it's better to use the same font than the first character one.

        The storage process will be able to still process correctly messages coming from the WebProcess to register clients of the registration.

        CSS ::selection stroke-color and stroke-width are not applied to selected text in text fields
        and ::selection:window-inactive stroke-color and stroke-width are never applied
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183178

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This change fixes the following two issues:
            1. Properties stroke-color and stroke-width are not applied to the ::selection pseudo-
               element of text fields.
            2. Properties stroke-color and stroke-width are never applied to ::selection:window-inactive
               pseudo elements.

        Currently when computing the paint styles for selected text we query the cached styles for
        the ::selection pseudo element on the renderer. Text fields are implemented using a User Agent
        shadow DOM. With regards to issue (1) the renderer queried was the inner most renderer for
        the text in the text field. But it should have been the shadow host renderer (i.e. the renderer
        for the <input>). With regards to issue (2) we cannot retrieve cached styles for the
        ::selection pseudo element because it can be effected by a pseudo class, :window-inactive,
        which matches when the page is deactivated (i.e. the window is in the background as the user
        made another window the frontmost window). Both of these issues are fixed by making use
        of RenderElement::selectionPseudoStyle().

        Scrollbar preferences are ignored when the WebContent process doesn't have access to the WindowServer.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        When the WebContent process doesn't have access to the WindowServer, the scrollbars are always of the overlay type.
        The notification about scrollbar preferences is never received by the WebContent process when there is no
        WindowServer access. This can be fixed by adding an observer of scrollbar preferences in the UI process, and
        notifying the WebProcess about this by sending it a message. This message should also contain the preferred
        scrollbar type, since the call '[NSScroller preferredScrollerStyle]' will always return the overlay style when
        there is no WindowServer access.

        In the r215424 commit the webRTCAvailable function started to use a function from the DARWIN platform,
        we have moved that code to the cocoa class and created a glib implementation that will be used in the future

        [FreeType] Color emojis in WebKitGTK+ for great justice
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183155

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Emojis are actually rendered if there's an emoji font installed in the system, but the size is so tiny that we
        don't see them. This is because for some reason the matrix we are getting from fontconfig contains a scale,
        which we don't expect. We only get the fontconfig matrix to apply rotations in case of oblique fonts, and then we
        always apply the scale for the computed pixel font size. Ignoring the fontconfig matrix scale fixes the issue.

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        The test has an anchor element with both a 'click' event handler which submits a form
        and an href attribute. When clicking the link, as per specification, things happen in
        this order:
        1. We fire the click event at the anchor, which will execute the event handler and submit the form.
           Submitting the form *schedules* a navigation to 'click.html'.
        2. We execute the anchor activation code which *navigates* to 'href.html'. The navigation to
           'href' is supposed to cancel the pending navigation to 'click.html' and we should navigate
           to 'href.html', which is what the test asserts.

        The issue for us is that we do not cancel pending navigations until after the navigation
        policy decision is made, when the provisional loads actually starts, in FrameLoader::provisionalLoadStarted().
        Because the policy decision for the navigation can now be made asynchronously, the NavigationScheduler
        timer can now fire while the decision is made and we'll submit the form, thus navigating to
        'click.html'.

        To address the issue, we now cancel any pending navigations in FrameLoader::loadWithDocumentLoader(),
        *before* doing the policy check for the navigation.

        [Web Animations] Correct implementation of pending tasks and promises
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183161

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We had an incorrect implementation of the spec due to two misinterpretations.

        The first one is about pending tasks (play and pause) which the spec says should
        be performed by "scheduling a task". In WebCore, this means using postTask() on a
        ScriptExecutionContext, such as Document. One of the big practical changes is that
        calling play() on an animation correctly sets its startTime to null (unresolved)
        immediately after the call to play() returns before setting it to a resolved value
        when the task is performed asynchronously. As a result, the playState is now always
        accurate.

        The second one is about promises where new promises need to be created in certain
        situations called out by the spec. We used to call clear() on them, but this merely
        resets the fulfillment or rejection state of the promise, while the spec requires
        a different object to be returned for the promise. We now create our promises using
        makeUniqueRef<> when new promise objects are expected to be created.

        This patch also corrects a few smaller bugs and spec compliant issues, called out
        below, related to pending tasks and promises uncovered while looking at relevant
        WPT tests.

        * animation/DocumentTimeline.h: Expose the Document used to create this timeline such
        that it may be used by WebAnimation objects registered for this timeline when scheduling
        a task is required via postTask().

        (WebCore::WebAnimation::setCurrentTime):
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::cancel): Ensure the finished promise has not already been fulfilled
        before rejecting it. While the spec does not specifically call this out, a promise may not
        be rejected after being fulfilled, and we would hit an ASSERT if we didn't also check that
        it was in the correct pending state before attemping to reject it.

        that task, but the spec says to check for either a pending pause or play task (ie. pending())
        and to cancel whichever is scheduled.
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::runPendingPlayTask): We were missing an assertion called out by the
        spec when running a pending task.
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::pause):

        [Extra zoom mode] Implement additional SPI for adjusting viewport shrink-to-fit behavior
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183100
        <rdar://problem/37840987>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Introduce new customization options to ViewportConfiguration. The first is m_forceHorizontalShrinkToFit, which
        (when set to true) forces the viewport to scale using shrink-to-fit heuristics, regardless of whether
        "shrink-to-fit=no" is specified via viewport parameters or if content width did not exceed minimum layout size.
        The second is m_viewSize, which reflects the true size of the viewport. See WebKit ChangeLog for more details.

        (WebCore::ViewportConfiguration::setForceHorizontalShrinkToFit):
        (WebCore::ViewportConfiguration::shouldIgnoreHorizontalScalingConstraints const):

        Bail early and return true if forceHorizontalShrinkToFit is set. This forces shrink-to-fit even in cases where

        (WebCore::ViewportConfiguration::initialScaleFromSize const):

        Use view dimensions rather than minimum layout dimensions when computing the initial scale. Minimum layout size
        is no longer always equal to the size of the view if the client has specified a minimum allowed layout width. As
        such, when computing the initial scale, to ensure that the content (which was laid out using the minimum layout
        size) fits within the real viewport, we need to divide real viewport dimensions by content dimensions.

        (WebCore::ViewportConfiguration::minimumScale const):

        Crash under SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal(WTF::String const&)

        SecurityOrigin objects are constructed on various threads. However, someone added a
        shouldTreatAsPotentiallyTrustworthy() call to the SecurityOrigin constructor which
        was not thread safe. This is because this function relies on SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure()
        and SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal() which were relying on global static HashMaps without
        locks.

        Update SecurityOrigin to initialize m_isPotentiallyTrustworthy lazily, to avoid paying
        initialization cost in the constructor. This is only queries by SecurityContext::isSecureContext().

        Make SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal() and SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure()
        thread-safe, since they are needed to initialize SecurityOrigin::m_isPotentiallyTrustworthy from
        various threads.

        SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure() is only called from SecurityOrigin (which requires
        thread-safety), and getUserMedia() which is not hot code so the extra locking there should not
        be an issue.

        SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal() is called from SecurityOrigin (which requires thread-
        safety). It is also called from isQuickLookPreviewURL(), MHTMLArchive::create(), Page::userStyleSheetLocationChanged(),
        isRemoteWebArchive() and HTMLPlugInImageElement. All these are not hot code so I do not think
        we need a fast path.

        Test: media/modern-media-controls/start-support/start-support-disable-controls-and-re-enable-post-play.html

        In the fix for webkit.org/b/182668, we made it so that when the "controls" attribute is absent from a media
        element we stop listening to the bulk of media events and prevent controls from updating any DOM properties
        so as to minimize the amount of CPU usage by the Web process.

        An unfortunate side effect was that, if the media controls were disabled at the time the video starts playing,
        the StartSupport class would thus not catch the "play" event and would not be able to set the "hasPlayed"
        property to "true" on the MediaController, which would then prevent the _shouldShowStartButton() from returning
        "false". As a result, if the "controls" attribute was turned back on after the media started playing, they
        would default to showing the start button, which would be then in the play state, ie. showing the pause icon.

        We now set the "hasPlayed" property in the "play" event handler on MediaController, which is always registered
        regardless of the "controls" attribute setting. We also ensure we invalidate the "showStartButton" property on
        the media controls when StartSupport is enabled, which is the case when the "controls" attribute is toggled back
        to "true" from a previous "false" value.

        On macOS, the functions screenAvailableRect and screenRect is implemented using NSScreen, which is communicating
        with the WindowServer. To avoid this WindowServer communication from the WebContent process when calling
        screenAvailableRect and screenRect, it is possible to let the UIProcess send a message to the WebContent
        process whenever there is a change in the display properties, and have the WebContent process cache these
        display properties. This message should also be sent to a newly started WebContent process.

        Regression(r228708): Crash under WebCore::MediaResource::responseReceived(WebCore::CachedResource&, WebCore::ResourceResponse const&)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=183018
        <rdar://problem/37754154>

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        The fix at r228708 was trying to address the fact that avplayer sometimes
        deallocates WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask objects on a non-main thread, which
        was not safe because its _resource data member needs to be deallocated on
        the main thread.

        The issue is that r228708 caused _resource to outlive its WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask.
        This is an issue because _resource has a client data member (of type WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTaskClient)
        which has a raw pointer to the WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask. This means that the main thread could
        call methods like responseReceived() on the resource, which would call responseReceived() on the
        client, which would try to call [WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTask receivedResponse:] with an invalid
        m_task pointer.

        To address the issue, I introduced a clearTask() method on WebCoreNSURLSessionDataTaskClient, which
        gets called from a non-main thread to clear the client's m_task pointer when the task is destroyed
        on a non-main thread. So that this is safe, every time the client tries to use m_task, we now
        acquire a lock for thread-safety and do a null-check on m_task.

        No new tests, no known reproduction case.

        Use ApplicationResourceLoader for cache entry loading.
        Remove all ResourceHandle use from ApplicationCacheGroup.
        Renamed m_loader in m_manifestLoader and added a new m_entryLoader to load cache entries.

        Updated ApplicationCacheResourceLoader to handle different types of CachedResource.
        This allows in particular to handle redirections based on the resource type and create the ApplicationCacheResource with the right type.
        Use Include as credentials mode as per specification.

        Add a new ApplicationCache ResourceResonse::Source.
        This allows fixing an assertion and should allow better inspector support if needs be.

        We have a completely different codepath for system-ui which makes it follow the system's
        font cascade list. This codepath (along with all the other relevant places which create
        system fonts) needs to obey the AllowUserInstalledFonts enum. This patch is fairly
        mechanical; we simply are hooking up the flag across SystemFontDatabase.

        There are a few places which creates system fonts which this patch doesn't touch. This is
        not a problem because all the remaining places either:
        1) Simply pull out some attributes of the font (name, weight, size, etc.) and then throw
        away the font object itself, or
        2) Use the font in an environment where script cannot access the characters rendered (such

        [iOS 11.3 Beta] Can't copy a URL from Safari and paste it into the Gmail app

        <rdar://problem/37636190>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        After r220865 refactored the iOS copy codepaths to use NSItemProviders, we stopped writing the URL as plain text
        to the pasteboard. However, this means clients that only check for "text/plain" (or one of its aliases) on the
        pasteboard won't read any data on paste.

        To fix this, we restore the pre-iOS 11.3 behavior of writing both the URL and plain text to the pasteboard.
        Since we're using item providers, we also ensure that the NSURL is at a higher fidelity than the string to make
        it clear that the data should be consumed as a URL.

        This patch also rebaselines an existing drag and drop test to cover this change, and adds a new API test,
        ActionSheetTests.CopyLinkWritesURLAndPlainText, which simulates copying a link using the share sheet and pasting
        into a DataTransfer-dumping test harness.

        [Cairo] Leverage ShadowBlur without using scratch buffer, target GraphicsContext
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182958

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        To allow ShadowBlur usage in different threads, avoid the ShadowBlur
        class using the scratch buffer internally. The current implementation of
        that scratch buffer is not thread-safe and its usage in such conditions
        can lead to crashes.

        Instead, the new methods use a temporary ImageBuffer object for drawing.
        This does negate the efficiency of possibly reusing the scratch buffer,
        but at this point that is not yet the priority. This only affects ports
        using Cairo for drawing.

        The added methods don't require a target GraphicsContext object to be
        passed in, instead they accept buffer draw callbacks that are invoked
        with the temporary ImageBuffer object containing the rasterized shadow,
        as well as position and size parameters. The CTM and clip bounds values
        also have to be passed in manually. In CairoOperations.cpp, the provided
        callbacks invoke commands that are equivalent in effect to those that
        would otherwise be invoked on the target GraphicsContext object in the
        ShadowBlur class.

        For now, this approach has to avoid the tiling-based drawing of the
        rectangular shadows in drawRectShadow() and inset shadows in
        drawInsetShadow(), and instead stick to the non-tiling fallback. While
        only affecting Cairo-using ports, with some refactoring it should be
        possible to again leverage the tiling-based approach as well.

        The beginShadowLayer() and endShadowLayer() functions, which are only
        used in CairoOperations.cpp, are replaced with the drawShadowLayer()
        method. This one accepts an additional callback that allows the caller
        to explicitly draw the shadow shape using the provided shadowing
        GraphicsContext object. As with the other two new methods, a temporary
        ImageBuffer object is used, and the buffer draw callback is invoked to
        allow caller to properly handle the shadowing output.

        In CairoOperations.cpp, the new ShadowBlur methods are exercised, with
        direct Cairo operation invocation replacing the GraphicsContext calls
        otherwise done through ShadowBlur. ShadowState object now also has to
        track the global alpha and the global composite operator values so that
        it can properly rasterize the resulting shadow into the final image.

        No new tests -- no change in behavior.

        [Web Animations] Make KeyframeEffect target nullable and read-write
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182741

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We used to completely disregard null targets, for instance not parsing keyframes, but targets
        can be null and are also supposed to be read-write for KeyframeEffect. We now update the IDL
        for KeyframeEffect to mark the target property as read-write and update the implementation
        to correctly handle null targets.

        This revealed a few issues in our implementation by allowing more WPT tests to run. So we also
        ensure that:
        
        - we don't crash when parsing font-related properties by calling update() on the generated
        RenderStyle's FontCascade when parsing keyframes.

        - CSS properties are provided as camel-case and not as hyphenated form

        - values provided in keyframes dictionaries are only read for valid properties

        - styles for effect targets are invalidated as soon as the timing model for that animation
        is changed

        so that it can call that function. We also check that we reject CSS properties that are not provided in

        (WebCore::processIterableKeyframes): Only read the JS values if we know that the provided JS property name
        maps to a valid CSS property.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::processKeyframes): Allow keyframes to be processed even if the effect's
        target is null.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::setTarget): Notify the animation that the effect target has changed and
        invalidate the style of the new target and the old targets, if any. We also update the blending keyframes
        since this task may not have been completed in a previous call to processKeyframes() due to the target being

        [Web Animations] Store all parsed keyframe input information in a single structure
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182903

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When parsing keyframe input provided through the JS API, we used to create several data structures.
        During parsing we would create a Vector<ProcessedKeyframe> where we would store the validated values
        for "offset", "easing" and "composite" as well as CSS properties and CSS values as strings. 

        Then we would create a KeyframeList, a class that pre-dates the work on Web Animations and is used
        for hardware animations, with RenderStyle objects that are used for CSS property blending at runtime.
        Once the KeyframeList was created, the Vector<ProcessedKeyframe> was discarded.

        Since KeyframeList did not know about nullable offsets, timing functions and composite operations, and
        because we do not with to modify a legacy class that we will eventually remove once all the Web Animations
        work is complete, we also stored the parsed offsets as m_offsets, the timing functions as m_timingFunctions
        and the composite operations as m_compositeOperations.

        In this patch we rename the ProcessedKeyframe structure used temporarily during parsing to ParsedKeyframe and
        store both the input and processed data related to a given keyframe in that single structure which we keep
        around as m_parsedKeyframes when we finished processing the keyframes input. This update ParsedKeyframe structure
        allows to keep around the original nullable offsets, the original CSS properties and CSS values as strings as
        a HashMap<CSSPropertyID, String>, as well as the CSS properties and CSS values as CSSValue objects using a
        MutableStyleProperties object. 

        This has the benefit of reducing the number of members, but also pave the way for supporting read-write targets
        where we will be able to decouple parsing keyframes and creating a KeyframeList, which requires a valid target
        to create RenderStyle objects used for blending, since the original parsing-time information is now stored.

        Finally, this allowed getKeyframes() to be more compliant by returning the CSS values as originally provided in
        the keyframe input with shorthand properties when provided, rather than the long-hands we used to read back
        through RenderStyle objects.

        The generated KeyframeList is now stored as m_blendingKeyframes and is only used for the purpose of interfacing
        with hardware animations and CSS property blending.

        While ProcessedKeyframe was copyable due to holding only simple types, ParsedKeyframe is not since it uses a Ref
        to hold the MutableStyleProperties. This uncovered some cases where we copied ProcessedKeyframe objects, we now
        ensure that the ParsedKeyframe objects are moved instead, which was the correct thing to do all along.

        * animation/KeyframeEffectReadOnly.cpp:
        (WebCore::computeMissingKeyframeOffsets): While we used to store std::optional<double> for the computed offset,
        we now store a simple double, which makes more sense since the computed offset is eventually a fully resolved

        to intermediate nullable computed offsets.

        This provides an implementation of Navigator's getVRDisplays()

        is very minimal for the time being, but this change lays the ground
        for all the changes that are about to land.

        The VR code uses a VRManager which is the interface with the
        platform code and the responsible for instantiating the right
        platform code. This platform code is currently being implemented

        [css-grid] Apply automatic minimum size clamping to spanning items too
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182684

        Reviewed by Javier Fernandez.

        In r225776 we added the conditions from the spec to apply
        the automatic minimum size clamping when required
        but only to non-spanning items.
        See: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#min-size-auto

        This patch moves the code from GridTrackSizingAlgorithm::sizeTrackToFitNonSpanningItem()
        to GridTrackSizingAlgorithmStrategy::minSizeForChild()
        that way the clamping is applied for both spanning and non-spanning items.

        This somehow reverts r225776, as it was adding some duplicated code.
        All the checks to know if we should use that part of the spec
        were already present in GridTrackSizingAlgorithmStrategy::minSizeForChild().

        Apart from using the previous code, there's a new loop to verify
        that the max track sizing function is fixed for all the tracks of the item.

        [GStreamer] Playbin3 support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182530

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        This patch introduces opt-in support for the playbin3 GStreamer
        element. This new playback element is still considered
        experimental but it can still be very useful for media assets
        containing multiple tracks of the same type. In such scenario
        audio/video decoders would be created only for the selected tracks
        whereas playbin2 creates decoder for each track.

        * platform/graphics/gstreamer/AudioTrackPrivateGStreamer.cpp: Take
        a weak pointer of the media player instead of playbin and call the
        player when enabling tracks. Also use the GstStream API instead of
        inspecting the pad when playbin3 is used.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Prior to r228238 we first detached the to-be-destroyed renderer and then
        started nuking its descendants. r228238 changed the order and now the descendants are
        destroyed while they are still attached to the tree. Apparently some of the takeChild()
        normalization logic gets triggered now that the renderers still have access to their previous/next
        siblings. This is unexpected and it shouldn't matter whether the subtree is still attached.
        Let's revert it to the original order for now (see webkit.org/b/182909).

        [GStreamer] Push smaller buffers from HTTP source
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182829

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        Split the received buffer into smaller buffers of a size consistent
        with the basesrc (4KiB). It is important not to push large buffers
        into the appsrc (where large is relative to the appsrc's configured
        byte size). If large buffers are pushed, then when they are internally
        dequeued by the appsrc, the buffering percentage can dramatically
        plummet due to a large amount of bytes being removed after a push. This
        can in turn trick the media player into thinking it needs to buffer,
        and then issuing a spurious set of playing->paused then
        paused->playing transitions, which by the time the buffering logic
        completes, data are already available.

        [Web Animations] Ensure that changing the timing model updates styles synchronously
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182836

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We did not invalidate the timing model when properties of an effect's timing object changed
        and even when we did invalidate the timing model, we did not update styles on effect targets
        synchronously, only scheduling such updates for the next animation frame.

        In this patch we expose the effect on the timing object such that changing timing properties
        can notify the effect of a change in the timing model, which can then be forwarded to the
        animation (which already informs its timeline, if any).

        Additionally, when an animation's timing model has changed, we now invalidate the effect, which
        will update styles synchronously.

        This produces a number of progressions in WPT tests.

        HarfBuzzFace: rework cache entry reference holding
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182828

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Move the FaceCacheEntry and HarfBuzzFaceCache types into the
        HarfBuzzFace class as CacheEntry and Cache, respectively. The Cache
        singleton is also moved there.

        In the HarfBuzzFace constructor, we now don't increase the CacheEntry
        reference, but instead just keep a reference to that object through
        a RefPtr<CacheEntry> object. We don't need to retrieve the hb_face_t
        object and the glyph cache HashMap in the constructor anymore, we just
        retrieve them when necessary through that CacheEntry reference.

        In the destructor, that RefPtr<CacheEntry> object is nulled out before
        the object in Cache is removed if that's where the final reference is
        kept.

        [WebAuthN] Revisit the whole async model of task dispatching, timeout and aborting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181946
        <rdar://problem/37258262>

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        This patch changes the original async model from a work queue to IPC between WebProcess
        and UIProcess. Since all authenticator operations must be handled in the UIProcess due
        to sandboxing, this message passing IPC async model then surpasses the original multi
        threading model. To cooperate that, a CredentialsMessenger class is then created and
        all task dispatching code is moved thre.

        As an improvement over existing code, static functions from PublicKeyCredential are
        moved to AuthenticatorManager. AuthenticatorManager is made as a singleton such that
        when static functions are called, they could reach the CredentialsMessenger to interact
        with UIProccess. CredentialsMessenger and AuthenticatorManager are separated so later
        on when other Credential types are created, they can reuse the same IPC messenger.

        What's more, a mock CredentialsMessenger is then created to mock behaviors of UIProcess
        for testing purpose.

        Covered by existing tests.

        Clean up HarfBuzzFaceCairo
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182824

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Clean up Cairo-specific bits of HarfBuzzFace implementation.

        HarfBuzzFontData is simplified, removing the constructor and turning the
        cairo_scaled_font_t member into a RefPtr<>, tying the Cairo object's
        lifetime to the lifetime of the HarfBuzzFontData instance.

        HarfBuzz font callbacks have the HarfBuzzFontData casting cleaned up,
        casting the user data pointer straight into a HarfBuzzFontData reference
        that's then used in the functions. HarfBuzzFontData member access is
        also adjusted.

        HarfBuzzFace::createFace() now references the cairo_scaled_font_t object
        that is then set as the user data pointer, with the destroy callback
        that dereferences that object also specified. With hb_face_t being a
        reference-counted object itself, this ensures the cairo_scaled_font_t
        object doesn't get destroyed while hb_face_t is still alive.

        In HarfBuzzFace::createFont(), the hb_font_t creation is cleaned up,
        with a C++ lambda used as the destroy callback.

        HarfBuzzFace should not be ref-counted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182823

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        The HarfBuzzFace objects shouldn't be copied along in FontPlatformData
        copy assignment operator, which made it a requirement for that class to
        be ref-counted. Cairo-based HarfBuzzFace implementation uses the
        cairo_scaled_font_t object from FontPlatformData internally, but upon
        FontPlatformData cloning that scaled font object could change, meaning
        HarfBuzzFace object that's shared with another FontPlatformData object
        would end up using a different cairo_scaled_font_t object from the one
        that's been regenerated in the newly-cloned FontPlatformData object.

        Instead of ref-counting the HarfBuzzFace objects, they should be handled
        in FontPlatformData through std::unique_ptr<>. In the FontPlatformData
        copy assignment operator, the copy target's m_harfBuzzFace object is
        nulled out, allowing the next harfBuzzFace() call to construct an
        object that properly leverages the cairo_scaled_font_t object that could
        have changed during cloning.

        Disallow cross-origin subresources from asking for credentials
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182579
        <rdar://problem/36162271>

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        Prompts for credentials to load cross-origin subresources are typically seen as unexpected
        by a person that navigates to- or interacts with- a web page. The cross-origin and implicit
        loading nature of these subresources makes asking for credentials questionable because they
        are not being served by the same origin of the page a person explicitly loaded and are not
        guaranteed to correspond to an explicit user interaction other than the initial load of the
        page. We know that subresources that ask for credentials can be abused as part of a phishing
        attack. It seems reasonable to disallow cross-origin subresources from asking for credentials
        due to their questionable nature and the risk for abuse. This will also make the behavior
        of WebKit match the behavior of Chrome.

        REGRESSION (r223440): Copying & pasting a list from Microsoft Word to TinyMCE fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182564

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        Unfortunately, r228352 was inadaquate to fix copying & pasting of a list item from Microsoft Word into TinyMCE
        in older verions of TinyMCE. This patch amends the approach taken by r228352 to make it work across the board
        as well as unbreak GMail.

        Turns out older versions of TinyMCE can't handle list items when computed styles are added as inline style
        declarations by WebKit. To make this work, avoid adding any computed styles as inline styles within mso-list
        conditionals as well as any p elements whose style attribute contains "mso-list" property. We would instead
        preserve these styles by keeping Microsoft Word's CSS style rules in addition to special @list rules.

        In addition, not keeping the style element of Microsoft Word in a head element as done in r228352 causes some
        versions of TinyMCE to treat it as regular text, and inserting a bunch of @list rules as user visible text.
        To work around this problem, we serialize the style rules as a comment (<!-- ~ -->) within a head element.

        Furthermore, when Microsoft Word is in the compatibility mode, it does not generate xmlns:o as the first xmlns
        declaration. Generalized the code to detect Microsoft Word's HTML declaration by looking for xmlns:o and xmlns:w
        xmls declarations. 

        Finally, it turns out that Gmail has its own handling of list items copy & pasted from Microsoft Word, and also
        needs this quirks but in the pasted HTML, not the one exposed in getData. As such, this patch also enables the
        MSO list quirks in the pasted content as well as the one exposed in getData.

        [WebAuthN] Revisit the whole async model of task dispatching, timeout and aborting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181946
        <rdar://problem/37258262>

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        This patch changes the original async model from a work queue to IPC between WebProcess
        and UIProcess. Since all authenticator operations must be handled in the UIProcess due
        to sandboxing, this message passing IPC async model then surpasses the original multi
        threading model. To cooperate that, a CredentialsMessenger class is then created and
        all task dispatching code is moved thre.

        As an improvement over existing code, static functions from PublicKeyCredential are
        moved to AuthenticatorManager. AuthenticatorManager is made as a singleton such that
        when static functions are called, they could reach the CredentialsMessenger to interact
        with UIProccess. CredentialsMessenger and AuthenticatorManager are separated so later
        on when other Credential types are created, they can reuse the same IPC messenger.

        What's more, a mock CredentialsMessenger is then created to mock behaviors of UIProcess
        for testing purpose.

        Covered by existing tests.

        [Web Animations] Make KeyframeEffect target nullable and read-write
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182741

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We used to completely disregard null targets, for instance not parsing keyframes, but targets
        can be null and are also supposed to be read-write for KeyframeEffect. We now update the IDL
        for KeyframeEffect to mark the target property as read-write and update the implementation
        to correctly handle null targets by creating a StyleResolver based on the ScriptExecutionContext's
        document's document element (the <html> element in practice) and not the target itself, since it
        can be null.

        This revealed a few issues in our implementation by allowing more WPT tests to run. So we also
        ensure that:
        
        - we don't crash when parsing font-related properties by calling update() on the generated
        RenderStyle's FontCascade when parsing keyframes.

        - CSS properties are provided as camel-case and not as hyphenated form

        - values provided in keyframes dictionaries are only read for valid properties

        - styles for effect targets are invalidated as soon as the timing model for that animation
        is changed

        We also rename AnimationTimeline::animationTimingModelDidChange() to AnimationTimeline::timingModelDidChange()
        since the previous name didn't add useful information and we're adding a new WebAnimation::timingModelDidChange()
        method, so having the two methods have a similar name made more sense.

        * animation/Animatable.idl: Call animate() with a ScriptExecutionContext rather than a ScriptState
        so that the ScriptExecutionContext can be passed to the KeyframeEffectReadOnly constructor.
        * animation/AnimationEffectReadOnly.h: Add a new invalidate() method, designed to be subclassed, that
        is called when the timing model for this effect or owning animation has changed.

        * animation/KeyframeEffectReadOnly.cpp:
        (WebCore::IDLAttributeNameToAnimationPropertyName): Move this function below CSSPropertyIDToIDLAttributeName
        so that it can call that function. We also check that we reject CSS properties that are not provided in
        camel-case form (eg. "font-size" vs. "fontSize").
        (WebCore::processIterableKeyframes): Only read the JS values if we know that the provided JS property name
        maps to a valid CSS property.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::create): Expect a ScriptExecutionContext rather than a ScriptState.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::processKeyframes): Expect a ScriptExecutionContext rather than a ScriptState
        and use the context's document to get an HTML element to create a StyleResolver. We also call update() on the
        generated RenderStyle's FontCascade since otherwise we would hit an ASSERT in FontCascade when parsing font-related
        CSS properties.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::setTarget): Notify the animation that the effect target has changed and invalidate
        the style of the new target and the old targets, if any.
        (WebCore::KeyframeEffectReadOnly::invalidate): Invalidate the target's style. This method is called by setTarget()
        and WebAnimation::timingModelDidChange().
        * animation/KeyframeEffectReadOnly.h: Expect a ScriptExecutionContext rather than a ScriptState.
        * animation/KeyframeEffectReadOnly.idl: Expect a ScriptExecutionContext rather than a ScriptState.

        know the animation's timing model has changed we can invalidate the associated effect, if any, as well as notify
        the timeline, if any. We used to only notify the timeline and, as a result, only invalidate the associated effect
        in the next display monitor refresh. 
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::effectTargetDidChange): This method is called in KeyframeEffectReadOnly::setTarget() to inform
        the animation of the previous effect target and the new one upon a target change. This allows us to forward this information
        onto the timeline so that we correctly add or remove the targets from the list of animated elements.
        (WebCore::WebAnimation::setStartTime):
        * animation/WebAnimation.h: Expose the new effectTargetDidChange() and timingModelDidChange() methods.

        Crash when breakpoint hit in unload handler

        Test: inspector/debugger/reload-paused.html

        CachedRawResource::updateBuffer may generate unload event in client notify callback. If Inspector was
        paused, this even would spawn a nested runloop. CachedRawResource::finishLoading would get called in
        the nested loop, confusing the DocumentLoader state machine and resulting in crashes later.

        REGRESSION (r228299): Broke reader mode in Safari
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182697
        <rdar://problem/37399012>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Rework the fix for r228299 to be more targeted. I moved the policy check
        cencelation from FrameLoader::stopLoading() to NavigationScheduler::schedule()
        when a pending load is cancelled by another load. I have verified that the
        sites fixed by r228299 still work with this more limited change. However,
        reader mode is now working again.

        The issue seems to be that we tell CFNetwork to continue with the load after
        receiving the response, even if the client has not responded to the
        decidePolicyForNavigationResponse delegate yet. As a result, CFNetwork sends
        us the resource data and we may commit the provisional load before receiving
        the policy response from the client. When the provisional load is committed,
        we call FrameLoader::stopLoading() which after r228299 cancelled pending
        policy checks. Because we did not wait for the policy check response to
        commit the load, we would cancel it which would make the load fail.

        The real fix here would be to make not tell CFNetwork to continue until after
        we've received the policy delegate response. However, this is a larger and
        riskier change at this point. I will follow-up on this issue.

        Covered by new API test.

        REGRESSION (r223440): Copying & pasting a list from Microsoft Word to TinyMCE fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182564

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        Turns out that Microsoft Word generates p and span elements with special styles instead of standard
        ul and ol elements when copying a list items, and TinyMCE has a specialized code path to process
        this proprietary format of Microsoft Word. The regression was caused by WebKit's sanitization code
        stripping away these non-standard CSS rules and inline styles.

        To preseve pre-r223440 behavior in TinyMCE, we preserve the following in a HTML markup:

        1. The "html" element at the beginning with xmlns content attributes
        2. @list rules in a style element starting with "/* List Definitions */" comment
        3. inline style content attribute with "mso-list" property
        4. comments conditional sections with "[if !supportLists]" and "[endif]"

        (1) is needed for TinyMCE to trigger the specialized code path for Microsoft Word. (2) contains
        the information about the structure of list items. (3) is needed to associate each p element with
        a rule in (2). (4) is needed to strip away the content generated as list markers (e.g. dots).

        We enable this "MSO list quirks" when the content comes from a non-WebKit client or a WebKit client
        that doesn't enable custom pasteboard data (detected by the content origin being null), and the HTML
        markup starts with a specific sequence of characters generated by Microsoft Word.

        mso-list and related properties only if they appear on their own. But we also need to preserve
        the inline style generated using the computed style since we would lose the inline styles of the text
        otherwise (e.g. red text and bold font). To workaround this, we generate two style content attributes,
        one containing computed styles and another one containing mso-list. Luckily, the HTML parsing algorithm
        dictates that the first attribute always wins when more than one attributes of the same name appears,
        so we place the computed style's style attribute first so that the pasted content in non-TinyMCE
        environment will continue to work.

        When PaymentResponse::complete() is called with a result of "unknown" or "fail", we should

        error with code "unknown" to the authorization result, which PassKit interprets as a

        <rdar://problem/37087060>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        After r222656, we treat images on the pasteboard as files. However, we also have an existing policy which hides
        text data ("text/uri-list", "text/html", "text/plain") from the page when files are present on the pasteboard.
        When copying a table, Microsoft Excel writes a rendering of the table to the pasteboard as an image. This means
        that we'll hide other data types (importantly, 'text/html') upon pasting, even though important clients (such as
        Google Docs and Confluence) depend on the 'text/html' data in order to correctly handle the paste (rather than
        paste as an image of a table).

        To fix this, we add an exception to the DataTransfer.getData codepath when the pasteboard contains files.
        Instead of always returning the empty string for text/html, we still allow pasteboard access, but only read
        from a limited set of rich text types, i.e. web archive, RTF(D), and HTML markup. Importantly, this prevents
        us from exposing any file paths that appear as plain text or URLs on the pasteboard. Just as in the regular
        codepath for getData(), if the pasteboard data comes from the same origin, we allow unsanitized access;
        otherwise, we use WebContentMarkupReader to extract markup from the pasteboard.

        Tests:  PasteMixedContent.ImageFileAndPlainText
                PasteMixedContent.ImageFileAndWebArchive
                PasteMixedContent.ImageFileAndHTML

        Augment the codepath handling the case where the pasteboard contains files, such that we allow reading
        "text/html", but only from rich text types.

        (WebCore::DataTransfer::readStringFromPasteboard const):

        Factor out logic for reading from the pasteboard into a private helper. This is called in two places from
        getDataForItem: in the normal (existing) path, and in the case where we allow 'text/html' to be read despite
        files appearing in the pasteboard.

        One important difference here is that this helper now takes a WebContentReadingPolicy, whose purpose is to
        prevent reading from non-rich-text types when files appear in the pasteboard.

        Another tweak here is that we now use `lowercaseType` instead of the original (unadjusted) `type` when reading
        from the pasteboard. This doesn't seem to be intended in the first place.

        (WebCore::DataTransfer::types const):

        can unintentionally be read back as web content.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        In WebCore, there are a few places where NSApp is referenced. Since the WebContent process
        is no longer using the NSApplication run loop, and NSApp is no longer guaranteed to be
        valid, we should make sure that the NSApp is not referenced by the WebContent process or
        the Network process, by asserting that the NSApplication event loop is running when NSApp
        is referenced. It is still ok for the UIProcess to reference NSApp. Adding these assert
        will help catch NSApp references when the NSApplication run loop is not used.

        Also, do not post a fake mouse event in PasteBoard::setDragImage when the NSApplication
        run loop is not running, since this is only relevant in WK1.

        [Web Animations] Refactor AnimationEffect and KeyframeEffect into AnimationEffectReadOnly, KeyframeEffectReadOnly and KeyframeEffect
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182608

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Currently, we have an AnimationEffect class with read-write members and a KeyframeEffect subclass with read-write
        members. The spec has an AnimationEffectReadOnly class, with read-only members, a KeyframeEffectReadOnly subclass,
        with read-only members, and then the KeyframeEffect subclass (of KeyframeEffectReadOnly) with read-write members.

        Likewise, currently we have an AnimationEffectTiming class with read-write members. While the spec has this class
        as well, it also specifies a read-only AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly superclass.

        In this patch we refactor the code to match the spec, which gives us a big boost in our WPT pass rate. The vast
        majority of the code is just copied from one class to another verbatim. The limited actual code changes, all related
        to the new subclassing, are:

        - AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly is not actually read-only as far as WebCore is concerned, it actually exposes setters
        for all of its properties, but the IDL for this class specifies all properties as read-only, so we match the spec. The
        reason for this is that it is necessary to be able to set members of an AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly object based on
        a Variant<double, KeyframeEffectOptions> provided to Element.animate() or the KeyframeEffectReadOnly and KeyframeEffect
        constructors, and the logic to handle properties in such dictionaries is the same as the logic required to set individual
        members in AnimationEffectTiming. So in essence, the sole role of AnimationTimingEffect is to provide an IDL interface
        with read-write members, but the parent class is itself read-write as far as WebCore is concerned.

        - AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly exposes a new setProperties() method which takes in a nullable Variant<double, KeyframeEffectOptions>
        so that code that was previously specific to KeyframeEffect can be factored into this method and both the constructors of
        KeyframeEffectReadOnly and KeyframeEffect can make use of it without code duplication.

        - The AnimationEffectReadOnly constructor now takes an AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly as input since that class and
        KeyframeEffectReadOnly expose an AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly object, while KeyframeEffect exposes an
        AnimationEffectTiming read-write object. This allows the KeyframeEffect constructor to provide the right object type.

        [Payment Request] Crash in PaymentRequest::canMakePayment() when Apple Pay payment method data is missing required fields
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182631

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        PaymentRequest::canMakePayment() needs to parse each payment method's serialized data to
        determine if it is a supported payment method. If parsing fails by raising an exception, we
        intend to skip over that payment method and try the next one. If all payment method data
        fail to parse, we resolve the returned promise with false. At no point do we intend to
        propagate the parsing exception up to the calling script, however.

        Even though we intend to swallow any exceptions from parsing, we failed to clear the
        JavaScript VM's exception state. The next time WebCore tries to execute JavaScript, a
        release assertion is raised due to seeing an unexpected exception in the VM.

        Fix this by using a CatchScope in PaymentRequest::canMakePayment(), and calling
        CatchScope::clearException() in the places we intend to swallow exceptions.

        Added a test case to http/tests/paymentrequest/payment-request-canmakepayment-method.https.html.

        [css-align] Implement the new behavior of 'legacy' for justify-items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172712

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The syntax of the 'justify-items' property accepts a new 'legacy' value,
        replacing the 'auto' value which is now parsed as invalid.

        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1318

        This change affects also to the 'place-items' shorthand, which doesn't
        accept 'auto' and, for the time being, neither 'legacy'.

        Since the new value 'legacy' is also the default value, I don't expect
        this change to break content of sites currently using the 'justify-items'
        property.

        No new tests, rebaselined existing test.

        Refactor the manner that the caps are handled, such as how to extract the resolution
        from the video caps or how to check if the caps are encrypted.

        The attachTrack function in PlaybackPipeline doesn't need the "structure" parameter,
        it is already included in the "caps" parameter.

        Replace the "mediaType" parameter by the "caps" parameter in reattachTrack function,
        it allows to use the new functions that handle the caps in GStreamerUtilities.

        <rdar://problem/37355283>

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Not testable right now as this relies on iOS specific Core Audio stack.
        Efforts should be made to somehow mock that part and mock interruptions.

        Made CoreAudioCaptureSourceFactoryIOS responsible to receive iOS interruption messages.
        Before the patch, individual capture sources were receiving these messages.
        When there is only one capture source per process this is fine but with more capture sources,
        this is messing up things as they all share the same shared unit and we would try to interrupt it or resume it several times.

        Also, if we are suspended and there is no more capture source, the shared unit will remain suspended indefinitely, as we will
        not process the interruption messages.
        With the patch, we always process the messages.
        We still go through the active source as done now to limit the changes.
        In case of no source, we go to the shared unit.
        In the future, we should directly go to the shared unit and clients of the shared unit should see their state being updated.

        As a way to prevent staying suspended on iOS, we unsuspend ourselves in CoreAudioCaptureSource constructor.
        This is fine as this constructor is only called when getUserMedia grants access to the camera which always goes to the UIProcess.
        And the UIProcess is only processing getUserMedia calls if the WebProcess is foregrounded.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Accessibility is doing too much work when handling attribute changes. Here's how we can improve this:
           1) Defer attribute changes while the tree is dirty (and coalesce them). 
           2) Don't create AXObjects when an attribute changes unnecessarily. If no client has requested an ax object, it's likely no work needs to be done
                 (with the exception of a few attributes like aria-modal)
           3) Stop calculating the entire accessible ARIA label when trying to decide if an element should be ignored. That's generally wasteful and the
                 consequence of including more AX elements in the tree is very minimal.

        Event improvements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179591

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        - removed all use of Deprecated::ScriptValue

        - fixed uses of JSC::Strong that can lead to reference cycles in CustomEvent,
          MessageEvent, and PopStateEvent, refactoring to share more code

        - removed incorrect use of CachedAttribute on attributes that can change values
          (should have fixed a bug; can we find a way to test this?)

        - did a more thorough job of clearing state from events, including clearing
          certain things before dispatching, and clearing more in initKeyboardEvent
          (may have fixed some obscure low-severity bugs; can we find a way to test this?)

        - removed "dummy" keyboard events

        - reworked code that omits details from error events for security reasons;
          old approach was "sanitizing" the error by removing the details if not
          allowed, new approach is adding the details only if allowed

        * Modules/encryptedmedia/NavigatorEME.h: Added forward declaration needed
        to compile.

        * Modules/indexeddb/IDBCursor.h: Added comment about incorrect use of JSC::Strong.
        * Modules/indexeddb/IDBRequest.h: Ditto.
        * Modules/paymentrequest/PaymentResponse.h: Ditto.

        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Added JSValueInWrappedObject.h.

        * bindings/js/CommonVM.cpp:
        (WebCore::commonVMSlow): Use VM::create instead of VM::createLeaked. Also use
        local variable instead of the global.

        * bindings/js/DOMWrapperWorld.h: Put the inline bodies of the currentWorld and
        worldForDOMObject functions separate from the declarations; long term goal is
        that the declarations serve as documentation, and are not interspersed with the
        implementations. Changed currentWorld to take a reference instead of a pointer
        to ExecState. Added isWorldCompatible function.

        * bindings/js/JSCustomElementInterface.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSCustomElementInterface::upgradeElement): Use toJSDOMWindow instead
        of toJSDOMGlobalObject and added check for null.
        (WebCore::JSCustomElementInterface::invokeCallback): Ditto.

        * bindings/js/JSCustomEventCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSCustomEvent::detail const): Use cachedPropertyValue.
        (WebCore::JSCustomEvent::visitAdditionalChildren): Added. Needed now that we are
        using JSValueInWrappedObject instead of JSC::Strong.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMConvertEventListener.h:
        (WebCore::Converter<IDLEventListener<T>>::convert): Pass a reference.
        * bindings/js/JSDOMGlobalObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::toJSDOMGlobalObject): Ditto.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMGlobalObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSDOMGlobalObject::JSDOMGlobalObject): Moved initialization to nullptr
        to the header.
        (WebCore::toJSDOMGlobalObject): Deleted.
        * bindings/js/JSDOMGlobalObject.h: Updated for the above.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMWindowBase.h: Updated includes. Added "DOMWindow.h" but also
        expanded the deprecated "JSDOMBinding.h" into all the things it includes.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMWindowProxy.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSDOMWindowProxy::finishCreation): Tweak argument type to match usage.
        (WebCore::JSDOMWindowProxy::create): Moved here from header, rolled in the code
        that creates the structure.
        (WebCore::JSDOMWindowProxy::setWindow): Take a reference instead of a pointer
        or a RefPtr&&.
        (WebCore::JSDOMWindowProxy::toWrapped): Use ? : instead of if.
        (WebCore::toJS): Pass a reference.
        * bindings/js/JSDOMWindowProxy.h: Updated for abvoe changes.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMWrapper.cpp:
        (WebCore::cloneAcrossWorlds): Added.
        * bindings/js/JSDOMWrapper.h: Ditto.

        * bindings/js/JSErrorHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSErrorHandler::JSErrorHandler): Changed to take a reference.
        Marked inline.
        (WebCore::JSErrorHandler::create): Moved here from header. No longer inline, but
        the constructor is now inline, so same number of levels of function calls, and
        less code compiled at the call site and less to compile in the header.
        (WebCore::JSErrorHandler::handleEvent): Use toJSDOMWindow instead
        of toJSDOMGlobalObject.
        * bindings/js/JSErrorHandler.h: Ditto. Also made createJSErrorHandler take
        references instead of pointers.

        * bindings/js/JSEventListener.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSEventListener::create): Moved here from the header.
        (WebCore::createEventListenerForEventHandlerAttribute): Updated for change to
        currentWorld.
        (WebCore::toJSDOMGlobalObject): Moved here from JSDOMGlobalObject.cpp because
        this is the only place this function is used now. Also, this was one of four
        different overrides and so it was good to delete the other three. Also updated
        to take a reference rather than a "must not be null" pointer.
        (WebCore::JSEventListener::handleEvent): Coding style tweaks.
        (WebCore::JSEventListener::virtualisAttribute const): Deleted. Now isAttribute
        is virtual and uses final as needed to remain inline-able and efficient.
        (WebCore::JSEventListener::operator== const): Use is<> and downcast<> instead
        of JSEventListener::cast.
        (WebCore::eventHandlerAttribute):  Updated for change to currentWorld.
        (WebCore::setEventHandlerAttribute): Ditto.
        (WebCore::setWindowEventHandlerAttribute): Ditto.
        (WebCore::setDocumentEventHandlerAttribute): Ditto.

        * bindings/js/JSEventListener.h: Moved create functions into the cpp file.
        Removed the cast function, since callers can use is<> and downcast<> instead.
        Use final rather than override and made isAttribute override the virtual
        function in the base class, eliminating virtualIsAttribute.

        * bindings/js/JSExtendableMessageEventCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSExtendableMessageEvent::data const): Use isWorldCompatible.
        Still need to return here and fix the reference cycle for this class.

        * bindings/js/JSLazyEventListener.cpp:
        (WebCore::eventParameterName): Moved up so it can be used by the constructor.
        (WebCore::convertZeroToOne): Added, so that the constructor can fix up text
        positions passed in to it as part of initializing a data member.
        (WebCore::JSLazyEventListener::JSLazyEventListener): Changed to take
        a CreationArguments object instead of lots of separate arguments.
        (WebCore::JSLazyEventListener::initializeJSFunction const): Removed unneeded
        checks of m_code and m_eventParameterName, both guaranteed not to be null
        by the constructor. Tweaked coding style a bit.
        (WebCore::JSLazyEventListener::create): Pass CreationArguments object.
        * bindings/js/JSLazyEventListener.h: Updated for above changes. Changed the
        m_eventParameterName to be a reference since it's always a global string
        that is never destroyed.

        * bindings/js/JSMessageEventCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSMessageEvent::data const): Use cachedPropertyValue and also
        updated for the new version of MessageEvent that uses a Variant instead
        of a type plus separate functions for each type.
        (WebCore::JSMessageEvent::visitAdditionalChildren): Added. Needed now that we are
        using JSValueInWrappedObject instead of JSC::Strong.

        * bindings/js/JSPopStateEventCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::JSPopStateEvent::state const): Use isWorldCompatible and also updated
        to use JSValueInWrappedObject instead of JSC::Strong. Would be nice to share more
        code with CustomEvent and MessageEvent, but at the moment they are subtly different.
        Changed cacheState from a function to a lambda.
        (WebCore::JSPopStateEvent::visitAdditionalChildren): Added. Needed now that we are
        using JSValueInWrappedObject instead of JSC::Strong.

        * bindings/js/JSValueInWrappedObject.h: Added.

        * bindings/js/ScriptCachedFrameData.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScriptCachedFrameData::restore): Updated for changes to JSDOMWindowProxy.
        * bindings/js/ScriptController.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScriptController::createWindowProxy): Ditto.
        (WebCore::ScriptController::setDOMWindowForWindowProxy): Ditto.

        * bindings/js/WorkerScriptController.cpp: Removed include of ScriptValue.h.
        (WebCore::WorkerScriptController::evaluate): Reworked to use the new
        canIncludeErrorDetails instead of sanitizeScriptError. Added a FIXME about the
        strange handling of the error message out argument.

        * bindings/scripts/CodeGeneratorJS.pm:
        (GenerateRuntimeEnableConditionalString): Pass a reference to worldForDOMObject.
        (GenerateImplementation): Removed an incorrect comment about a removed error
        check that is truly unneeded.
        (GenerateAttributeGetterBodyDefinition): Pass a reference to worldForDOMObject.
        (GenerateAttributeSetterBodyDefinition): Pass references to createJSErrorHandler
        and worldForDOMObject.
        (GenerateCallWith): Pass a reference to worldForDOMObject.

        * bindings/scripts/test/JS/JSTestGlobalObject.cpp: Updated for above changes.
        * bindings/scripts/test/JS/JSTestNamedGetterCallWith.cpp: Ditto.
        * bindings/scripts/test/JS/JSTestObj.cpp: Ditto.

        * dom/CustomEvent.cpp:
        (WebCore::CustomEvent::CustomEvent): Marked inline. Removed now unneeded
        ExecState argument.
        (WebCore::CustomEvent::create): Moved here from header. No longer inline, but
        the constructor is now inline, so same number of levels of function calls, and
        less code compiled at the call site and less to compile in the header.
        (WebCore::CustomEvent::initCustomEvent): Updated to use JSValueInWrappedObject.
        (WebCore::CustomEvent::trySerializeDetail): Deleted. Now handled by bindings.
        * dom/CustomEvent.h: Updated for the above.
        * dom/CustomEvent.idl: Added JSCustomMarkFunction and removed
        CallWith=ScriptState.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::shouldBypassMainWorldContentSecurityPolicy const):
        Updated to pass reference to currentWorld but also rewrote to be more direct.

        * dom/Element.cpp:
        (WebCore::Element::isKeyboardFocusable const): Take a pointer instead of a
        reference to the keyboard event. This function can be called with no event;
        before this patch we were using a "dummy event".
        * dom/Element.h: Ditto.

        * dom/ErrorEvent.cpp:
        (WebCore::ErrorEvent::error): Use isWorldCompatible.

        * dom/Event.cpp:
        (WebCore::Event::create): Moved here from header.
        (WebCore::Event::createForBindings): Ditto.
        (WebCore::Event::initEvent): Updated to use the name m_canceled instead of
        the name m_defaultPrevented.
        (WebCore::Event::resetBeforeDispatch): Added. Clears m_defaultHandled so
        a value left over from a previous dispatch doesn't affect the next dispatch.

        * dom/Event.h: Renamed m_defaultPrevented to m_canceled to match specification
        terminology and be slightly clearer. Added resetBeforeDispatch. Removed the
        setDefaultPrevented function.

        * dom/EventDispatcher.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent): Added call to resetBeforeDispatch.

        * dom/EventListener.h: Made isAttribute virtual and got rid of virtualIsAttribute,
        which was an alternative to using "final" before we had that in the language.

        * dom/EventTarget.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventTarget::dispatchEvent): Added call to resetBeforeDispatch.

        * dom/KeyboardEvent.cpp:
        (WebCore::KeyboardEvent::KeyboardEvent): Removed unneeded code that initializes
        m_handledByInputMethod to false; we do that in the class definition now.
        (WebCore::KeyboardEvent::create): Moved here from header.
        (WebCore::KeyboardEvent::createForBindings): Ditto.
        (WebCore::KeyboardEvent::initKeyboardEvent): Added code to reset m_charCode,
        m_isComposing, m_keyCode, m_repeat, m_underlyingPlatformEvent, m_which, m_code,
        and m_key. These are needed now that we can reuse an existing event; we don't
        want them getting out of sync with the other data members.
        (WebCore::KeyboardEvent::keyCode const): Updated for name change from m_keyEvent
        to m_underlyingPlatformEvent.
        (WebCore::KeyboardEvent::charCode const): Ditto.
        (WebCore::findKeyboardEvent): Deleted. Was unused.
        * dom/KeyboardEvent.h: Updated for the above. Removed KeyboardEvent::createForDummy.

        * dom/MessageEvent.cpp:
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::MessageEvent): Removed unnneded ExecState argument.
        Simplified since m_data is now a Variant.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::create): More of the same.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::initMessageEvent): Ditto.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::trySerializeData): Deleted.
        (WebCore::MessageEvent::data const): Deleted.
        * dom/MessageEvent.h: Use a Variant.
        * dom/MessageEvent.idl: Added JSCustomMarkFunction and removed
        CallWith=ScriptState and CachedAttribute.

        * dom/MouseEvent.h: Removed obsolete comment.
        * dom/MouseEvent.idl: Wrap line differently.

        * dom/PopStateEvent.cpp:
        (WebCore::PopStateEvent::PopStateEvent): Removed unneeded ExecState argument.
        Updated to use JSValueInWrappedObject.
        (WebCore::PopStateEvent::create): Ditto.
        (WebCore::PopStateEvent::trySerializeState): Ditto.
        * dom/PopStateEvent.h: Ditto.
        * dom/PopStateEvent.idl: Use JSCustomMarkFunction, and don't use
        ConstructorCallWith=ScriptState.

        * dom/ScriptExecutionContext.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScriptExecutionContext::sanitizeScriptError): Deleted.
        (WebCore::ScriptExecutionContext::canIncludeErrorDetails): Added.
        (WebCore::ScriptExecutionContext::dispatchErrorEvent): Clarify by
        using canIncludeErrorDetails instead of sanitizeScriptError.
        * dom/ScriptExecutionContext.h: Ditto.

        * dom/WheelEvent.cpp:
        (WebCore::WheelEvent::WheelEvent): Updated for name change and also to
        eliminate m_initializedWithPlatformWheelEvent.
        (WebCore::WheelEvent::create): Moved here from header.
        (WebCore::WheelEvent::createForBindings): Ditto.
        (WebCore::WheelEvent::initWebKitWheelEvent): Renamed from initWheelEvent.
        * dom/WheelEvent.h: Renamed initWheelEvent to initWebKitWheelEvent since
        there is no standard init function for wheel events and we have this only
        for backward compatibility. Got rid of the separate boolean
        m_initializedWithPlatformWheelEvent and instead made the renamed
        m_wheelEvent, m_underlyingPlatformEvent, optional for when there is no
        underlying platform event.

        * html/BaseDateAndTimeInputType.cpp:
        (WebCore::BaseDateAndTimeInputType::isKeyboardFocusable const): Take a
        pointer to the event so we can handle the case where there is no event.
        * html/BaseDateAndTimeInputType.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLAnchorElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLAnchorElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLAnchorElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLAreaElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLAreaElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLAreaElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLDocument.cpp: Added include of "DOMWindow.h".
        * html/HTMLFormControlElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Take
        pointer to the event.
        * html/HTMLFormControlElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLFrameOwnerElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLFrameOwnerElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLFrameOwnerElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLIFrameElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLInputElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::isTextFormControlKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLInputElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLPlugInElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLPlugInElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLSelectElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLSelectElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLSelectElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/HTMLTextAreaElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLTextAreaElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/HTMLTextAreaElement.h: Ditto.
        * html/InputType.cpp:
        (WebCore::InputType::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/InputType.h: Ditto.
        * html/RadioInputType.cpp:
        (WebCore::RadioInputType::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/RadioInputType.h: Ditto.
        * html/TextFieldInputType.cpp:
        (WebCore::TextFieldInputType::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * html/TextFieldInputType.h: Ditto.

        * inspector/CommandLineAPIHost.cpp:
        (WebCore::listenerEntriesFromListenerInfo): Pass reference to currentWorld.
        Use is<> and downcast<> instead of JSEventListener::cast.
        * inspector/PageScriptDebugServer.cpp:
        (WebCore::PageScriptDebugServer::isContentScript const): Pass reference to
        currentWorld.
        * inspector/agents/InspectorDOMAgent.cpp:
        (WebCore::InspectorDOMAgent::buildObjectForEventListener):
        Use is<> and downcast<> instead of JSEventListener::cast.

        * mathml/MathMLElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::MathMLElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Take a
        pointer to the event so we can handle the case where there is no event.
        * mathml/MathMLElement.h: Ditto.

        * page/DOMWindow.cpp:
        (WebCore::DOMWindow::dispatchEvent): Added call to resetBeforeDispatch.
        All event dispatching paths now need to do this; there are 3.

        * page/EventHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::handleWheelEventInAppropriateEnclosingBox): Use the new
        underlyingPlatformEvent function, less confusing than calling a function
        named wheelEvent() on an object of type WheelEvent. Also, it returns
        a const& to std::optional instead of a pointer, so updated for that.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::defaultWheelEventHandler): Ditto.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::internalKeyEvent): Use preventDefault instead
        of setDefaultPrevented(true).
        (WebCore::EventHandler::tabsToLinks const): Take a pointer.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::defaultArrowEventHandler): Pass a pointer.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::defaultTabEventHandler): Ditto.
        * page/EventHandler.h: Updated for the above.

        * page/EventSource.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventSource::dispatchMessageEvent): Pass a reference rather
        than a pointer when creating a message event.

        * page/FocusController.cpp:
        (WebCore::isFocusableElementOrScopeOwner): Use a pointer instead of reference
        for keyboard event.
        (WebCore::isNonFocusableScopeOwner): Ditto.
        (WebCore::isFocusableScopeOwner): Ditto.
        (WebCore::shadowAdjustedTabIndex): Ditto.
        (WebCore::FocusController::findFocusableElementDescendingIntoSubframes):
        Renamed to use simpler terminology than "descending down into frame document".
        Changed to take a pointer instead of reference.
        (WebCore::FocusController::setInitialFocus): Pass nullptr instead of
        using KeyboardEvent::createForDummy.
        (WebCore::FocusController::advanceFocus): Pointer instead of reference.
        (WebCore::FocusController::advanceFocusInDocumentOrder): Ditto.
        (WebCore::FocusController::findFocusableElementAcrossFocusScope): Ditto.
        (WebCore::FocusController::findFocusableElementWithinScope): Ditto.

        (WebCore::FocusController::advanceFocusDirectionallyInContainer): Ditto.
        (WebCore::FocusController::advanceFocusDirectionally): Ditto.
        * page/FocusController.h: Updated for the above.

        * page/PageConsoleClient.cpp:
        (WebCore::objectArgumentAt): Added. Helper to make functions below simpler.
        (WebCore::canvasRenderingContext): Factored out logic to get the context
        from either a canvas or a canvas rendering context from the functions below.
        Also updated to not use ScriptValue and to use auto quite a bit more.
        (WebCore::PageConsoleClient::record): Updated to use the functions above.
        (WebCore::PageConsoleClient::recordEnd): Ditto.

        * page/ios/EventHandlerIOS.mm:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::tabsToAllFormControls const): Take a pointer
        instead of a reference.
        * page/mac/EventHandlerMac.mm:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::tabsToAllFormControls const): Ditto.
        * page/win/EventHandlerWin.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::tabsToAllFormControls const): Ditto.

        (WebCore::SVGAElement::isKeyboardFocusable const): Ditto.
        * svg/SVGAElement.h: Ditto.

        * testing/Internals.cpp:
        (WebCore::Internals::isFromCurrentWorld const): Use isWorldCompatible.

        In WebCore, there are a few places where NSApp is referenced. Since the WebContent process
        is no longer using the NSApplication run loop, and NSApp is no longer guaranteed to be
        valid, we should make sure that the NSApp is not referenced by the WebContent process or
        the Network process, by asserting that the NSApplication event loop is running when NSApp
        is referenced. It is still ok for the UIProcess to reference NSApp. Adding these assert
        will help catch references to NSApp when the NSApplication run loop is not used.
        Also, do not post a fake mouse event in PasteBoard::setDragImage when the NSApplication
        run loop is not running, since this is only relevant in WK1.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Reverts unintended changes in <http://trac.webkit.org/r226396>. Before r226396, WebContentReader::readFilenames
        (a helper function in macOS-specific code) contained logic to create and insert attachment elements if
        ENABLE(ATTACHMENT_ELEMENT); otherwise, it would fall back to inserting the visible URL as a text node. Since we
        enable the attachment element on all Cocoa platforms via xcconfig files, this was effectively dead code.

        However, when r226396 (which moved this out from macOS to Cocoa platform code) refactored this helper function,
        it also moved this chunk of code out of the !ENABLE(ATTACHMENT) conditional and into a PLATFORM(MAC) guard,
        which means that we now fall back to inserting file paths as text when attachment elements are disabled. To fix
        this, we simply remove the (previously) dead code.

        A more subtle difference is that we no longer always return true from WebContentReader::readFilePaths. This
        means that when we drop files, we no longer skip over the early return in documentFragmentFromDragData when
        we've made a fragment, so we read the file path as a URL. To address this, we just restore the pre-macOS 10.13.4
        behavior of initializing the document fragment.

        Previously, declaring a Promise argument as optional would result in a native type of
        std::optional<RefPtr<DOMPromise>>. This is wasteful, since RefPtr can represent an optional
        argument by storing nullptr. Further, PassArgumentExpression() assumed Promises were never
        optional and tried to pass the argument as a Ref by calling RefPtr::releaseNonNull().

        This patch removes the std::optional wrapper around optional Promises and simply passes the
        promise as a RefPtr to native code.

        This test failed because the controls bar would not hit test at the moment we synthesized a mousemove over the controls bar as the first step towards
        synthesizing a click on the controls bar to dismiss the tracks panel. Indeed, it would have "pointer-events" set to "none" until the tracks panel was
        dismissed, which would only happen after the click event had been propagated. All we need to do is to ensure that none of the controls within the controls
        bar get activated as a result of clicking over them when the tracks panel is visible, so we instead set "pointer-events" to "none" on all children of a
        controls bar rather than the controls bar itself, which can thus still hit test.

        <rdar://problem/37159363>

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        The bug was caused by the fact it's not always safe to invoke updateLayout even when isSafeToUpdateStyleOrLayout
        on a document of a flattened frame on iOS. isSafeToUpdateStyleOrLayout returns true when the frame view is in
        the frame-flattening mode to avoid hitting a release asssertion in updateLayout of the frame. However, it's still
        not safe to invoke updateLayout on a parent frame in this case.

        As a result, inlineVideoFrame (in Source/WebKit/WebProcess/cocoa/VideoFullscreenManager.mm) invokes updateLayout
        even when the top-level document is not safe to update when the video element is in a frame-flattened document.

        Fixed this bug by explicitly checking that we still have a live render tree and document hasn't been stopped.
        Also replaced other uses of isSafeToUpdateStyleOrLayout by more explicit checks.

        I found out that this test was flakily timing out because our jobQueues would sometimes get stuck
        when their current job's connection or service worker (when scheduled by a service worker) would
        go away before the job is complete.

        This patch makes our job queues operation more robust by:
        1. Cancelling all jobs from a given connection when a SWServerConnection goes away
        2. Cancelling all jobs from a given service worker when a service worker gets terminated

        We also make sure service workers created by a job get properly terminated when a job
        is canceled to avoid leaving service workers in limbo.

        No new tests, unskipped existing flaky test.

        [css-grid] Rename gutter properties to remove "grid-" prefix

        column-gap already existed before, as it's part of Multicol.
        The patch adds the new properties row-gap and gap, and keep the legacy ones

        - grid-column-gap => column-gap
        - grid-row-gap => row-gap

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Take the Non-Cairo GraphicsContext3D functionality that's stashed in
        GraphicsContext3DCairo and move it into the GraphicsContext3DTextureMapper
        file.

        In GraphicsContext3DCairo.cpp, only the Cairo-specific GraphicsContext3D
        functionality remains, specifically ImageExtractor and paintToCanvas().

        Everything else is moved into GraphicsContext3DTextureMapper.cpp. This
        filename and its location under platform/graphics/texmap/ was chosen
        since all the ports using this file (GTK, WPE, WinCairo) are also using
        the TextureMapper module. Various #if-guards are simplified in the
        moved-over code to reflect this.

        GraphicsContext3DCairo.cpp now better reflects GraphicsContext3DCG.cpp,
        with both implementing functionality specific to a 2D painting library,
        whereas GraphicsContext3DTextureMapper.cpp reflects
        GraphicsContext3DCocoa.cpp in covering functionality needed to integrate
        the GraphicsContext3D output into the platform-specific composition
        system.

        If a scale < 1 is applied to the page, then the visual viewport will be bigger
        than the layout viewport. Our hit testing code would then ignore any hits
        that were outside the layout viewport.

        The fix is to only apply a hit testing clip if the page is scaling up, not down.

        the frame will be detached when removed from its previous position in the DOM tree. When being

        However, this method will return early when executed in a beforeunload handler, since navigation
        is not allowed then. The end result is a detached frame which will continue to load, and hitting

        inline-block baseline not computed correctly for vertical-lr
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170176

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        When computing the baseline position of inline-block elements we use the
        InlineFlow logicalTop and the FontMetrics ascent. The issue comes from
        the fact that these units are incompatible. The logicalTop of a
        vertical-lr element is offset to the left edge, while the ascent is the
        distance from the right edge.

        We need to either use logical value for the FontMetrics ascent so we can
        compute the correctly the baselines of vertical-lr elements, or just using
        the logicalBottom for these cases.

        The approach based on a logicalAscent API for FontMetrics would require
        a lot of work because inline-block logic assumes everything is vertical-rl
        and at some point, flips the elements along the block-axis in case of
        vertical-lr mode.

        While it'd be desirable to get rid of this flipping logic, this patch tries
        first the simpler approach of using logicalBottom, which aligns with the
        currently implemented logic.

        [Modern Media Controls] Turn media/modern-media-controls/start-support tests back on
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182297

        Reviewed by Jon Lee and Eric Carlson.

        We identified one cause of flakiness when turning those tests back on and fix it in this patch. There would be
        cases where the play/pause button would never actually become visible because we would first set it as one of
        the buttons in the left container in the bottom controls bar before we would identify that we should show the
        prominent play/pause button, and then once we did, we would add it as a child to the InlineMediaControls. But,
        because the actual layout of the ButtonsContainer would happen in a rAF due to being a layout() method, we would
        remove the play/pause button from the InlineMediaControls and set it as a child of the left container even
        though it wasn't visible.

        Performing the layout of a ButtonsContainer should really happen immediately when we set the buttons, so in this
        patch we remove the "buttons" property and clients of ButtonsContainer can simply add or remove children which
        will be laid out in a row. To support this, we've added two notification methods to LayoutNode, one that indicates
        when children have changed, didChangeChildren(), which we override in ButtonsContainer to perform a synchronous
        layout. The other method is willRemoveChild() which we also override in ButtonsContainer, this time to reset
        the "x" and "visible" properties which we set while performing layout.
        
        This fixes flakiness for media/modern-media-controls/start-support/start-support-click-to-start.html, and maybe
        other modern-media-controls tests that could have been affected by this unexpected behavior.

        [css-align] The 'baseline' value must be invalid for the 'justify-content' property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181794

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The CSS WG has resolved that it doesn't make sense to define Baseline
        Content-Alignment in the inline/main axis.

        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1184

        The spec has been updated so that <baseline-postion> is not valid for
        the 'justify-content' property's syntax. This CL updates our parsing
        logic to match the new spec, including the parsing logic of the
        place-content shorthand.

        Additionally, this CL updates the computed value of the
        <baseline-position> values to match other browsers.

        We don't implement support for <baseline-position> values in the
        Content Distribution properties (align-content and justify-content),
        so I don't expect this change to break content of sites using the CSS
        Box Alignment feature.

        No new tests, just adapt the Web Platform Tests we already have to the new CSS syntax.

        Resource Load Statistics: Introduce debug mode as experimental feature

        No new tests. This adds an experimental feature.

        The only changes to default behavior are:
        - Increased resolution on timestamps which is needed to be able to set shorter
          timeouts in debug mode.
        - Only update partitioning and blocking table when needed. This is an optimization
          which pays off in less XPC with shorter timeouts.

        When a frame element is moved in the DOM tree during the execution of a beforeunload handler,
        the frame will be detached when removed from its previous position in the DOM tree. When being
        detached, an attempt will also be made to stop the load by calling FrameLoader::stopAllLoaders().
        However, this method will return early when executed in a beforeunload handler, since navigation
        is not allowed then. The end result is a detached frame which will continue to load, and hitting
        asserts in DocumentLoader::dataReceived(), and DocumentLoader::notifyFinished(). It should be
        possible to stop a frame load, even when executing a beforeunload handler.

        Instead of using the GraphicsContext(cairo_t*) constructor, leverage the

        through that GraphicsContextImpl implementation.

        A new GraphicsContextImplCairo constructor is added, expecting pointer

        created, with ownership of that object now being handled by the
        GraphicsContextImplCairo class.

        Call sites of the GraphicsContext(cairo_t*) constructor are adjusted to
        instead provide a factory function that returns a fresh
        GraphicsContextImplCairo object, passing that cairo_t object to its
        constructor.

        Document::absoluteRegionForEventTargets() can fire when layout is dirty, and SVGPathElement's path() can be null if it
        hasn't been laid out yet. So protect against a null path in getBBox().

        Not easily testable because internals.nonFastScrollableRects() forces layout, and the crash depends on the timing of
        absoluteRegionForEventTargets().

        We now initialize the registrations' active worker as soon as we load
        them from disk. We do not necessarily have a SW Context process connection
        identifier yet at this point so I made it optional on the SWServerWorker.
        This identifier gets set on the SWServerWorker when the worker is actually

        [css-multicol] Support percentages in column-gap
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182004

        Reviewed by Javier Fernandez.

        This patch adds percentage support to column-gap property.

        Most of the changes are related to the parsing logic,
        the column-gap property now accepts both length and percentages,
        on top of the "normal" initial value.
        A new utility class GapLength has been added, as it'll be useful
        to implement row-gap in the future.

        Apart from that the muticolumn layout code has been modified
        to resolve the percentage gaps (treating them as zero while computing
        preferred widths) and resolving them during layout.
        This doesn't follow the current text on the spec, but there is an
        ongoing discussion that might cause the text is changed:
        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/509#issuecomment-355242101
        We could update the implementation once we have a definitive answer
        from the CSS WG.

        Make scrolling to the focused element async
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181575
        <rdar://problem/36459767>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Made the revealing of the focused element asynchronous in Element::focus. Like selection, schedule a timer when
        a new element is focused, and only scroll to the focused element when the timer fires. If any other scrolling
        happens meanwhile, we cancel this timer.

        There are two Web exposed behavioral changes:
        1. The scrolling position doesn't change immediately when calling Element::focus.
        2. Only the last focused element will be revealed.

        Both behavioral changes pose its own compatibility risks but we're making a conscious decision here since
        the scrolling asynchronous has a clear performance benefit.

        There is one edge case to cosnider: when the history controller restores the scrolling position, canceling the
        timer results in a focused element in an overflow: hidden element to be never revealed. Expediate revealing of
        the focused element in this one case instead of canceling.

        ScrollingStateNode::reconcileLayerPositionForViewportRect is currently only called on the
        direct children of root of the scrolling tree. Hence nodes like "position: fixed" will not
        update their layers after scrolling when they are deeper in the tree. This is already
        possible on iOS with overflow nodes and will happen with subframes when async scrolling is
        implemented. This commit fixes that issue by recursively calling the function
        ScrollingStateNode::reconcileLayerPositionForViewportRect on the scrolling tree.

        [Cairo] Use GraphicsContextImplCairo for ImageBuffer context
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181977

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Enhance the GraphicsContextImpl interface to the point of enabling the
        Cairo-based implementation to be used for GraphicsContext construction
        in ImageBufferCairo.cpp.

        In order to enable GraphicsContextImpl implementations to properly
        manage PlatformGraphicsContext objects, the hasPlatformContext() and
        platformContext() methods are added. Cairo implementation returns true
        in the first method, and returns pointer to the PlatformContextCairo
        object in the second. The DisplayList::Recorder, due to its recording
        nature, doesn't manage such an object, so it returns false and nullptr,
        respectively.

        GraphicsContextImpl also gains the setCTM(), getCTM(), clipBounds() and
        roundToDevicePixels() methods, corresponding to the GraphicsContext
        methods that now invoke these new methods on any existing m_impl object.
        GraphicsContextImplCairo implementations mimic the existing behavior in
        the Cairo-specific GraphicsContext methods, but DisplayList::Recorder
        implementations remain no-op, logging the invocation but doing nothing
        otherwise.

        drawImage() and drawTiledImage() methods on the GraphicsContextImpl
        interface are changed to return the ImageDrawResult value, corresponding
        to what's been done in the method. In DisplayList::Recorder, the methods
        return ImageDrawResult::DidRecord, while in GraphicsContextImplCairo the
        methods return the return result of Image::draw() or Image::drawTiled()
        call.

        To make the protected Image::draw() and Image::drawTiled() methods
        accessible, invocations of those are packed into static drawImageImpl()
        and drawTiledImageImpl() functions on the GraphicsContextImpl class.
        This makes it possible to simply declare GraphicsContextImpl class as a
        friend class of Image, and not every specific GraphicsContextImpl
        derivation. Implementations of these functions mirror behavior of the
        drawImage() and drawTiledImage() methods on the GraphicsContext class,
        when an m_impl object isn't present, constructing a scope-tied
        InterpolationQualityMaintainer object and invoking the relevant Image
        method.

        To make immediate use of the new GraphicsContextImplCairo functionality,
        the GraphicsContext construction in Cairo-specific ImageBuffer
        implementation now uses a factory function that returns a new
        GraphicsContextImplCairo object through which the given
        PlatformContextCairo is used for painting.

        No new tests -- no change in functionality.

        This patch implements PublicKeyCredential's [[DiscoverFromExternalSource]] from
        https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#getAssertion as of 5 December 2017. In order to
        do testing, a dummy authenticator is implemented to exercise a failure and a
        pass path. A number of dependencies need to be resolved later in order to comply
        with the spec, which are marked by FIXME in the patch and tracked by proper
        bugs. Those dependencies will be addressed once the first prototype is finshed.

        Implement line clamp for mail.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=180818

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This patch implements a form of clamping that can clamp lines at both the top
        and the bottom, and the interior can be replaced with a DOM element (identified
        by id) that replaces the middle section.

        The implementation derives from the multicolumn classes, but ultimately the
        clamp should derive from the fragmentset classes instead (with most of the current
        multicolumn code moving into base classes).

        The virtualization of many of the multicolumn functions is something that would happen
        once we move pages/printing over to this pagination model anyway.

        REGRESSION (r226138): Selecting a line that ends with zero-width joiner (ZWJ) may cause text transformation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181993
        <rdar://problem/36421080>

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Re-implement paint optimization that was inadvertently removed in r226138. This optimization
        works around an issue where selecting the last printable character in a line that is followed
        followed by a zero-width joiner transforms the selected character.

        We need to fix <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181964> to improve the interaction
        of selection and zero-width joiner characters. For now, re-implement a paint optimization
        to perform a single paint operation when the style of the non-selected text is identical
        to the style of the selected text.

        My fix for YouTube360 changed the way we composite WebGL on macOS. Unfortunately it dropped
        a flag telling the compositor the colorspace of the content should be sRGB. Reinstate this
        by explicitly setting the colorspace on the IOSurface we use for WebGL back buffers.

        This *should* be covered by the test in:
        fast/canvas/webgl/match-page-color-space.html
        ... however, it shows a problem with our testing infrastructure. As long as it is not
        testing on a Wide Gamut display, and explicitly setting the color profile, an automated
        test won't pick up this regression. I could add an Internals helper to query the colorspace
        of the WebGL content, but that doesn't actually verify the composited result, which is
        all that matters.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Observe that HTMLFormElement::associatedElements returns a const reference to a Vector of raw
        FormAssociatedElement pointers. In various call sites that iterate through these associated elements using this
        function, some require synchronous layout updates per iteration, which can lead to a bad time when combined with
        the first observation.

        To address this, we introduce HTMLFormElement::copyAssociatedElementsVector. This returns a new vector
        containing strong Refs to each associated element. From each call site that may trigger synchronous layout and
        execute arbitrary script while iterating over associated form elements, we instead use iterate over protected
        FormAssociatedElements.

        From each call site that currently doesn't (and shouldn't) require a layout update, we use the old version that
        returns a list of raw FormAssociatedElement pointers, but add ScriptDisallowedScopes to ensure that we never
        execute script there in the future.

        [css-align] 'left' and 'right' should parse as invalid in block/cross-axis alignment
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181792

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The CSS WG resolved to remove the 'left' and 'right' values from the
        block/cross axis alignment properties.

        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1403

        This patch changes the CSS parsing logic of all the CSS Box Alignment
        properties, both block-axis (align-{self, items, content} and
        inline-axis (justify-{self, items, content}).

        Additionally, the alignment shorthands (place-{self, items, content})
        have been also changed to respect the new syntax.

        Despite the number of layout tests changed, I don't think this
        change will break any content in current sites. The CSS values
        'left' and 'right' were introduced by the new CSS Box Alignment
        spec and only implemented by the CSS Grid Layout feature, shipped
        last year. Additionally, the removed values have no effect on the
        layout result when they are applied to the block/cross-axis CSS
        Alignment properties.

        [Web Animations] Expose getKeyframes() and parsing of remaining keyframe properties
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181978
        <rdar://problem/36772586>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We finish our implementation of multiple keyframes by exposing the getKeyframes() method on KeyframeEffect and
        parsing the remaining properties that can be exposed on keyframes: "easing" and "composite". And since we parse
        those properties on keyframes, we also parse "easing" on AnimationEffectTiming and "composite" and "iterationComposite"
        on KeyframeEffect. 

        To support this, we implement a new TimingFunction::createFromCSSText() method which takes in a string that is
        a value provided directly via the JS API. As its converse, we expose a TimingFunction::cssText() method which
        provides a string that can be sent back to JS to represent a timing function, using keywords when the timing
        function matches one and ommitting default values.

        We now also keep track of the original "offset" value provided through the JS API since that value is required
        when calling getKeyframes() and distinct from the "computedOffset". These original offsets, composite operations
        and timing functions are kept as separate Vectors from the KeyframeList since this type does not support exposing
        those. We may consider improving that in a future patch.

        Finally, we make some adjustments in the keyframe parsing to comply with the specification and correctly parse
        all provided timing functions, regardless of the number of keyframes and timing functions provided.

        Note that this patch is only about parsing, storing and returning provided easing and composite operations but
        that such values will only be used for the resolution of animation effects in future patches.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Microsoft Outlook Web App forces users to switch to the lite version on
        the login page with our standard user agent on all non-macOS systems.
        Since it is an application that can be installed by different companies,
        schools and organizations, it is not possible to fix the issue unless
        we keep a big list of host names that are known to run it. We check the
        host name instead of the base domain name here because it is not
        expected to run all sites under a base domain on this webmail and
        calendar application.

        https://mail.ntu.edu.tw is a site that is known to run Microsoft Outlook
        Web App for several years, and it is not likely to change. When there
        are other sites found to run it and having the same user agent problem,
        we can expand the list to include them.

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Add support of multi keys from different MediaKeySession in CDMInstanceClearKey.

        Currently the CDMInstanceClearKey manages two "m_keys", one is a WTF::Vector
        where it stores the list of last added keys, an other which is defined in the
        ClearKeyState::singleton it is a WTF::HashMap, in this last one, it stores the
        keys lists of each created session.

        The method "keys()" of CDMInstanceClearKey returns the first "m_keys" which
        contains just the list of last keys.

        The goal of this commit is to return all keys lists of all sessions, thus
        we remove the "m_keys" which is WTF::Vector and we modify the method
        "keys()" to return all keys lists, which is stored in "m_keys" WTF::HashMap,
        in one Vector instead of return just the list of last keys.

        [WebAuthN] Implement PublicKeyCredential's [[Create]] with a dummy authenticator

        <rdar://problem/36459893>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        This patch implements PublicKeyCredential's [[Create]] from https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#createCredential
        as of 5 December 2017. In order to do testing, a dummy authenticator is implemented to exercise a failure
        and a pass path. A number of dependencies need to be resolved later in order to comply with the spec.
        Also, the current architecture of handling async WebAuthN operations including dispatching, timeout, and aborting
        might need a redesign once the underlying authenticator is clear. Since this is our first attempt to implement
        a prototype, all those limitations, in my opinion, can be marked as non-blocking to accelerate the whole
        process. Those limitations will then be addressed once the first prototype is finshed.

        [Cocoa] Support font collections
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181826
        <rdar://problem/36455137>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Use the CoreText call CTFontManagerCreateFontDescriptorsFromData() to get all the descriptors inside
        the collection file. We select which one by using the fragment identifier at the end of the url linking
        to the remote font. For example, to select the 4th font inside a TTC file, the @font-face block would
        look like:

        @font-face {
            font-family: "MyFont";
            src: url("path/to/font.ttc#4");
        }

        Note that these numbers are 1-indexed.

        The CSS Fonts spec states:
        > Fragment identifiers are used to indicate which font to load. If a container format lacks a defined
        > fragment identifier scheme, implementations should use a simple 1-based indexing scheme (e.g.
        > "font-collection#1" for the first font, "font-collection#2" for the second font).

        Not only are TTC font collections supported, but WOFF2 font collections are also supported, which is
        increasingly important web standard.

        No new tests because I don't have a font collection file with the appropriate license for the
        WebKit repository. I tested manually.

        All the filters that use ParallelJobs<> has the same type of bug where very wide but not tall
        filter regions could result in computing an optimalThreadNumber that was greater than the
        number of rows to process, which resulted in jobs with zero rows to process.

        Since we split the work by rows, cap the maximum number of threads to height/8 so that each job
        has at least 8 rows of pixels to process. Add some assertions to detect jobs with zero rows.

        FEMorphology was also using implicit float -> int conversion to detect integer overflow of radius,
        so change that to use explicit clamping.

        Do not paint synchronously when popup items have been added or changed while the popup is visible.
        If new popup items have been added after the popup was shown, a synchronous paint operation will
        possibly access their style before it is ready, leading to a null pointer crash. The invalidated
        area will be painted asynchronously.

        No new tests. To reproduce this crash, it is necessary to open a popup with JavaScript, add new
        popup items, and then end the test. Opening the popup can be done by sending a mousedown event
        with the eventsender. However, on Windows the mousedown event is sent synchronously, and will
        block as long as the popup is open and running the popup event loop. This means no JS can be
        executed until the popup is closed, causing the test to always time out before new popup items
        can be added. I have verified the fix with a manual test case.

        The bug was caused by WebContentReader::readHTML and WebContentMarkupReader::readHTML not sanitizing plain HTML string
        as done for web archives even when custom pasteboard data is enabled. Fixed the bug by doing the sanitization.

        Unfortunately, we can't make file URLs available in this case because WebContent process doesn't have sandbox extensions
        to access local files referenced by the HTML source in the clipboard, and we can't make WebContent process request for
        a sandbox extension¸on an arbitrary local file, as it would defeat the whole point of sandboxing.

        Instead, we strip away all HTML attributes referencing a URL whose scheme is not HTTP, HTTPS, or data when sanitizing
        text/html from the clipboard to avoid exposing local file paths, which can reveal privacy & security sensitive data
        such as the user's full name, and the location of private containers of other applications in the system.

        For subresource loads, redirections will not change who is in charge of continuing the load (service worker or network process).
        For navigation loads, we need to match the registration for every redirection since this is using the Manual redirect mode.
        This allows starting the load with a service worker and finishing the load with another service worker, which will become the controller.

        Implement this by wrapping the registration matching of an URL within DocumentLoader::matchRegistration.

        [css-align] 'overflow' keyword must precede the self-position and content-position value

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        There were several discussions to avoid ambiguities with the complex
        values, specially when it comes to define the place-xxx shorthands.

        One of the sources of problems is the 'overflow-position' keyword. The
        CSS WG has decided to change the syntax of all the CSS Box Alignment
        properties so that the 'overflow-position' keyword always precede the
        'self-position' or the 'content-position' keywords.

        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1446#event-1125715434

        In order to apply this change to the Content Distribution properties'
        (align-content and justify-content) syntax I had to completely
        re-implement their parsing function. Thanks to this I addressed also

        No new tests, just rebaselined the expected results of the test cases affected.

        Despite the so many layout tests affected by this change, it's
        unlikely that it might break any content in current web
        sites. This patch changes the new CSS syntax, obviously backward
        compatible, defined by the new CSS Box Alignment. The
        'overflow-position' keyword is only used by the layout models
        implementing the new spec, so far only CSS Grid Layout.
        Considering that CSS Grid has been shipped last year, it's unlikely
        that many sites are using the new CSS values.

        [css-grid] Spanning Grid item has too much space at the bottom / is too high

        Reviewed by Javier Fernandez.

        In IndefiniteSizeStrategy::findUsedFlexFraction() we were not
        subtracting the size of the gutters when we call findFrUnitSize().
        If an item spans several tracks, we cannot pass the maxContentForChild()
        directly, we need to subtract the gutters as they are treated
        as fixed size tracks in the algorithm.

        The spec text is pretty clear regarding this
        (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#algo-find-fr-size):
        "Let leftover space be the space to fill minus the base sizes
         of the non-flexible grid tracks."

        Gutters are treated as fixed-size tracks for the purpose
        of the track sizing algorithm, so we need to subtract them from the
        leftover space while finding the size of an "fr".

        The crash was caused by an erroneous instantiation of ScriptDisallowedScope::InMainThread in CachedPage::restore.
        It can execute arbitrary scripts since CachedFrame::open can update style, layout, and evaluate media queries.

        This is fine because there is no way to put this page back into a page cache until the load is commited via
        FrameLoader::commitProvisionalLoad is invoked later which only happens after CachedPage::restore had exited.

        REGRESSION (macOS 10.13.2): imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/media-source/mediasource-* LayoutTests failing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181891

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        In macOS 10.13.2, CoreMedia changed the definition of CMSampleBufferGetDuration() to return
        the presentation duration rather than the decode duration. For media streams where those two
        durations are identical (or at least, closely similar), this isn't a problem. But the media
        file used in the WPT tests have an unusual frame cadence: decode durations go {3000, 1, 5999,
        1, 5999,...} and presentation durations go {3000, 2999, 3000, 2999}. This caused one check in
        the "Coded Frame Processing" algorithm to begin failing, where it checks that the delta
        between the last sample's decode time and the new decode time is no more than 2x as far as
        the last sample's duration. That's not a problem as long as the "duration" is the "decode
        duration" and the samples are all adjacent. Once the "duration" is "presentation duration",
        all the assumptions in the algorithm are invalidated. In the WPT test case, the delta between
        decode times is 5999, and 2 * the presentation duration is 5998, causing all samples up to
        the next sync sample to be dropped.

        To work around this change in behavior, we'll adopt the same technique used by Mozilla's MSE
        implementation, which was done for similar reasons. Rather than track the "last frame duration",
        we'll record the "greatest frame duration", and use actual decode timestamps to derive this
        duration. The "greatest frame duration" field will be reset at the same times as "last frame
        duration", and will be used only in the part of the algorithm that checks for large decode
        timestamp gaps.

        No new tests (Covered by existing tests, including GC-specific ones).

        The basic premise here is as follows:
        - You can *always* GC a MessagePort that is closed
        - You can *always* GC a MessagePort that has no onmessage handler, as incoming messages cannot 
          possibly revive it.
        - You can GC a MessagePort, even if it has a message handler, as long as there are no messages 
          in flight between it and the remote port, and as long as the remote port is "maybe eligible for GC."
          
        A MessagePort is considered "maybe eligible for GC" once hasPendingActivity is asked once.
        
        A MessagePort loses "maybe eligible for GC" status once it is used for sending or receiving a message.
        
        The changes to MessagePort.cpp implement the above with a tiny little bool-driven state machine.

        [Apple Pay] Stop eagerly loading PassKit.framework
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181911
        <rdar://problem/36555369>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r226458 and r226123 added code that caused PassKit.framework to be eagerly loaded when
        initializing a WKWebView. This is costly and should only be done when Apple Pay is first used.

        To avoid eagerly loading PassKit, this patch does two things:

        1. Instead of sending the available payment networks as part of WebPageCreationParameters,
        PaymentCoordinator asks for them using a syncrhonous message the first time they are needed.
        2. Instead of setting the Apple Pay preference to false when PassKit can't be loaded,
        the following API entry points check for a missing PassKit and return false, or throw
        exceptions, or reject promises:
            - ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()
            - ApplePaySession.canMakePaymentsWithActiveCard()
            - ApplePaySession.openPaymentSetup()
            - ApplePaySession.begin()

        No new tests for (1), which causes no change in behavior. (2) was manually verified by
        locally moving aside PassKit.framework, but that's not possible to do in an automated test.

        [macOS] [WK2] Drag location is computed incorrectly when dragging content from subframes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181896
        <rdar://problem/35479043>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        In r218837, I packaged most of the information needed to start a drag into DragItem, which is propagated to the client layer
        via the startDrag codepath. However, this introduced a bug in computing the event position and drag location in window
        coordinates. Consider the case where we're determining the drag image offset for a dragged element in a subframe:

        Before the patch, the drag location (which starts out in the subframe's content coordinates) would be converted to root view
        coordinates, which would then be converted to mainframe content coordinates, which would then be converted to window coordinates
        using the mainframe's view. After the patch, we carry out the same math until the last step, where we erroneously use the
        _subframe's_ view to convert to window coordinates from content coordinates. This results in the position of the iframe relative
        to the mainframe being accounted for twice.

        To fix this, we simply use the main frame's view to convert from mainframe content coordinates to window coordinates while
        computing the drag location. As for the event position in window coordinates, this is currently unused by any codepath in WebKit,
        so we can just remove it altogether.

        Since this bug only affects drag and drop in the macOS WebKit2 port, there's currently no way to test this. I'll be using
        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181898> to track adding test support for drag and drop on macOS WebKit2. Manually tested
        dragging in both WebKit1 and WebKit2 on macOS. dragLocationInWindowCoordinates isn't used at all for iOS drag and drop.

        There is a short period of time, early in the registration process where a
        SWServerWorker object exists for a registration but is not in the registration's
        installing/waiting/active slots yet. As a result, if a registration is cleared
        during this period (for e.g. due to the user clearing all website data), that
        SWServerWorker will not be terminated. We then hit assertion later on when this
        worker is trying to do things (like call skipWaiting).

        To address the issue, we now keep a reference this SWServerWorker on the
        registration, via a new SWServerRegistration::m_preInstallationWorker data member.
        When the registration is cleared, we now take care of terminating this worker.

        No new tests, covered by existing tests that crash flakily in debug builds.

        Service worker registrations restored from disk may not be reused when the JS calls register() again

        <rdar://problem/36591711>

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        The issue was that when restoring a registration from disk, we would not set its active worker right
        away. We only set it later in installContextData(). installContextData() is only called after we’ve
        launched the service worker process and established a connection to it.

        However, we would start processing jobs (such as registrations) before we’ve established the connection
        to the service worker process. SWServerJobQueue::runRegisterJob(), in order to reuse an existing
        registration checks the registration’s active worker has the right script URL. The issue was that when
        this code would execute, we may not have set the registration’s active service worker yet, in which case,
        we would update the existing registration instead of reusing it as-is.

        To address the issue, we now delay the processing of jobs until the connection to the service worker
        process has been established and we've installed all pending contexts via installContextData().

        Changed is covered by new API test.

        Make in-process MessagePorts be (mostly) asynchronous

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        No new tests (Covered *brutally* by existing tests)

        Part of making MessagePorts be a thing we can pass across processes is making them work async.
        
        The existing "MessagePortChannel" method of abstraction was not cut out for this.
        This patch gets rid of MessagePortChannel and adds a new MessagePortChannelProvider abstraction.
        It then gets the new machinery working in-process (with some pieces of out-of-process in place)

        One synchronous behavior this patch maintains is the hasPendingActivity() check used to support GC.
        That will (creatively) be made async in the next followup.
        
        More generally from MessagePorts, this patch also adds a "MessageWithMessagePorts" object to be used
        with all forms of postMessage(). Much better.

        Always specify the -[NSURL _title] to be either the title specified in a PasteboardImage's inner PasteboardURL,
        or if no title is specified, fall back to the user-visible URL string. This is because at least one internal
        client always tries to use the -_title property to determine the title of a pasted URL, or if none is specified,
        the -suggestedName. Since we need to set suggestedName to the preferred file name of the copied image and we
        don't want the suggested name to become the title of the link, we need to explicitly set the link title.

        In doing so, this patch also fixes a bug wherein we forget to set the _title of the NSURL we're registering to
        an NSItemProvider.

        This test is failing because Editor::clientReplacementURLForResource expects a MIME type, but on iOS, the type
        paramter passed into WebContentReader::readImage is a UTI; subsequently, the bundle editing delegate receives
        a MIME type that's actually a UTI, which is incorrect. To address this, ensure that a MIME type is passed to
        bundle SPI by converting the type in WebContentReader::readImage to a MIME type.

        'fetch' event may be sent to a service worker before its state is set to 'activated'

        'fetch' event may be sent to a service worker before its state is set to 'activated'.
        When the registration's active worker needs to intercept a load, and its state is 'activating',
        we queue the request to send the fetch event in SWServerWorker::m_whenActivatedHandlers.
        Once the SWServerWorker::setState() is called with 'activated' state, we then call the
        handlers in m_whenActivatedHandlers to make send the fetch event now that the worker is
        activated. The issue is that even though the worker is activated and its state was set to
        'activated' on Storage process side, we had not yet notified the ServiceWorker process
        of the service worker's new state yet.

        To address the issue, we now make sure that SWServerWorker::m_whenActivatedHandlers are
        called *after* we've sent the IPC to the ServiceWorker process to update the worker's
        state to 'activated'. Also, we now call ServiceWorkerFetch::dispatchFetchEvent()
        asynchronously in a postTask() as the service worker's state is also updated asynchronously
        in a postTask. This is as per specification [1], which says to "queue a task" to fire
        the fetch event.

        We need to match the specification exactly here or things will happen in the wrong
        order. In particular, things like "update registration state" and "update worker state"
        might happen *after* firing the fetch event, even though the IPC for "update registration/worker
        state" was sent before the "fire fetch event" one, because the code for updating a registration/
        worker state already queues a task, as per the specification.

        as they may also send IPC to the Service Worker process, and we need to make sure this IPC happens
        after so that the service worker is in the right state.

        [Cairo] Use one-time ShadowBlur objects when performing shadowing

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Don't maintain a ShadowBlur object in the PlatformContextCairo class.
        Instead, use temporary ShadowBlur objects whenever shadowing is needed,
        providing all the shadow state information to it and drawing shadow into
        the given GraphicsContext object.

        ShadowBlur constructors are cleaned up. The 'shadows ignored' argument
        can now also be provided to the variant that accepts explicit shadow
        attributes, but the argument is false by default.

        In CairoOperations, the ShadowBlurUsage functionality is rolled into the
        new ShadowState class. ShadowState parameter is now used for operations
        that might need to perform shadow painting. Call sites are modified
        accordingly.

        Cairo::State::setShadowValues() and Cairo::State::clearShadow() are
        removed, since the ShadowBlur object that was modified through those is
        being removed from the PlatformContextCairo class. We still have to flip
        the Y-axis of the shadow offset in GraphicsContext::setPlatformShadow()
        when shadows are ignoring transformations.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179986

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch reverts all or parts of the following changes-sets
            <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/221292>
            <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/197967>
            <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/196670>

        A JS statement like this:
            var item = text.x.animVal.getItem(0);

        Creates the following C++ objects:
            SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff<SVGLengthListValues> for 'text.x'
            SVGListPropertyTearOff<SVGLengthListValues> for 'text.x.animVal'
            SVGPropertyTearOff<SVGLengthValue> for 'text.x.animVal.getItem(0)'

        If 'item' changes, the attribute 'x' of the element '<text>' will change
        as well. But this binding works only in one direction. If the attribute
        'x' of the element '<text>' changes, e.g.:

            text.setAttribute('x', '10,20,30');

        This will detach 'item' from the element <text> and any further changes 
        in 'item' won't affect the attribute 'x' of element <text>.

        The one direction binding can only work if this chain of tear-off objects
        is kept connected. This is implemented by RefCounted back pointers from
        SVGPropertyTearOff and SVGListPropertyTearOff to SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff.

        The security crashes and the memory leaks are happening because of the
        raw forward pointers:
            -- SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff maintains raw pointers of type
               SVGListPropertyTearOff for m_baseVal and m_animVal
            -- The m_wrappers and m_animatedWrappers of SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff
               are vectors of raw pointer Vector<SVGLength*>

        To control the life cycle of the raw pointers, SVGListPropertyTearOff and
        SVGPropertyTearOff call SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff::propertyWillBeDeleted()
        to notify it they are going to be deleted. In propertyWillBeDeleted(), we
        clear the pointers so they are not used after being freed. This mechanism
        has been error-prone and we've never got it 100% right.

        The solution we need to adopt with SVG tear-off objects is the following:
            -- All the forward pointers should be weak pointers.
            -- All the back pointers should be ref pointers.

        This solution may not look intuitive but it solves the bugs and keeps the
        one direction binding. The forward weak pointers allows the tear-off
        objects to go aways if no reference from JS exists. The back ref pointers
        maintains the chain of objects and guarantees the correct binding.

        Data URL fonts split in the middle of an alphabet cause random letters to disappear
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175845
        <rdar://problem/33996578>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        It is fairly common practice for a font foundry to split a font up into two files such that a semi-random
        half of the alphabet is present in one of the files, and the other half is present in the other file. This
        practice involves representing the files as data URLs, so as to minimize the time it takes to load them.

        Because resource loading is asynchronous (even for data URLs), it is possible today to get a paint after
        the first file is loaded but before the second file is loaded. Indeed, because of the way font fallback
        works, we will never start loading the second file until a layout has occurred with the first font.

        Because a site usually only uses this pattern for a handful of fonts, and I've never seen this pattern
        being used for CJK fonts, it isn't very expensive to opportunistically decode these data URLs eagerly.
        Using this method doesn't actually guarantee that the two fonts will load in between successive paints,
        but it at least makes this much more likely. This patch implements this strategy, along with a size
        threshold to make sure that we won't decode any super large data URLs when it isn't necessary.

        When decidePolicyForNavigationAction is responded to asynchronously during a client redirect, 
        HistoryController::updateForRedirectWithLockedBackForwardList does not update the history because
        the document loader has not been marked as a client redirect because the FrameLoader only looks
        at its provisional document loader to mark it as a client redirect.  When decidePolicyForNavigationAction
        is responded to asynchronously, though, the FrameLoader's provisional document loader has moved to 
        its policy document loader.  To get both asynchronous and synchronous cases, let's just mark the document
        loader as a client redirect whether it's the provisional or policy document loader.

        don't check for it.

        No new tests because I couldn't find the specific input that causes it to return nullptr. (I
        tried running this code with every 0, 1, and 2 length locale string, every weight value, and
        every italic value, and couldn't get it to crash. I also inspected the code to figure out what
        values would cause it to return nullptr, and I couldn't find anything other than if the system
        has a totally busted font setup.)

        Very large element indices in the ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER meant that
        our simulated vertexAttrib0 buffer might be too large. We need
        to check for out-of-memory, but we can also detect some of the issues
        earlier in our validation code. Additionally, make sure that we don't

        [WebAuthN] Import a CBOR coder from Chromium
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181522
        <rdar://problem/36055729>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        This patch imports a CBOR coder including encoder and decoder from Chromium. CBOR encoder
        is needed for WebAuthN to encode attestation object into binaries. When supporting extensions
        in the future, CBOR encoder/decoder will be needed as well. Implementating and maintaining
        a fully-fledged CBOR coder doesn't seem to align with WebKit's best interests. Therefore,
        importing a most suitable third party implementation will be wise.

        In this patch, it fully integrate the whole coder into our codebase. Those changes includes:
            1. Substitute data structures that enjoy a better WTF version.
            2. Replacing marcos.
            3. Implementating workarounds for some functionalities that we lack fundamental types' support.
            4. Changing the coding style to match ours.

        This patch doesn't intend to improve the logic of the original codebase. Hence some of the
        coding logic might not match what WebKit ususally has.

        Here is a full list of Chromium changes that constructed this CBOR coder in chronological order:

        We had some code in ComplexTextController to ask the FontCache for a font, given the name
        of a particular font CoreText used inside a CTRun. This is wrong for two reasons: fonts
        are not identifiable by PostScript name (in the general case), and because the lookup
        procedure requires a FontDescription, the result may yield a font that is not the one
        looked up. The goal of this code was simply to preserve the rendering mode of the font,
        but we removed support for these rendering modes years ago. So the solution is to skip
        that lookup and use the CoreText font directly.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181550

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When requesting data for an attachment element that is backed by a file path, we currently trigger a load in the
        web process to fetch contents of the attachment data as inline data in the AttachmentInfo. This is unnecessary,
        since the file path of the attachment element must have come from the UI process anyways, so it is sufficient to
        simply send the file path to the UI process and have the UI process read the contents of the path as a memory-
        mapped NSData.

        This patch lets HTMLAttachmentElement skip over resource loading codepaths when creating an AttachmentInfo for
        the client, and also teaches _WKAttachment to read a AttachmentInfo's filepath as memory-mapped data if a file
        path is present, and no inline data was specified.

        Covered by existing API tests.

        Because listening to "webkitplaybacktargetavailabilitychanged" events incurs some higher power usage on iOS,
        we only listen to such events when controls are visible to the user. In other words, the MediaControls need to
        have both "visible" set to "true" and "faded" set to "false". To support this, we add a delegate method on
        MediaControls such that it can tell the MediaController that the "visible" property changed. With this message,
        MediaController can inform its MediaControllerSupport objects that user visibility of the controls changed, which
        lets AirplaySupport disable itself when controls are no longer visible.

        provider registration call, and contains either a type identifier and data buffer, or an NSItemProviderWriting-
        conformant object. To register an item provider using a WebItemProviderRegistrationInfo, the item provider
        pasteboard currently checks to see whether the info contains an object or a type and data.

        This patch removes WebItemProviderRegistrationInfo and replaces it with WebItemProviderDataRegistrar. Objects
        that implement this protocol know how to take an NSItemProvider and register data to it. So far, there are
        three implementations below.

        (-[WebItemProviderDataRegistrar initWithData:type:]):
        (-[WebItemProviderDataRegistrar typeIdentifier]):
        (-[WebItemProviderDataRegistrar data]):

        (-[WebItemProviderDataRegistrar dataForClient]):
        (-[WebItemProviderDataRegistrar registerItemProvider:]):
        (-[WebItemProviderDataRegistrar description]):

        A data registrar takes a UTI and data buffer, and registers the UTI to the data. This replaces a
        WebItemProviderRegistrationInfo with both a type and data, but no representing object.

        (-[WebItemProviderWritableObjectRegistrar initWithObject:]):
        (-[WebItemProviderWritableObjectRegistrar representingObjectForClient]):
        (-[WebItemProviderWritableObjectRegistrar registerItemProvider:]):
        (-[WebItemProviderWritableObjectRegistrar description]):

        The writable object registrar writes an NSItemProviderWriting-conformant object to an item provider. This
        replaces a WebItemProviderRegistrationInfo with only a representing object.

        Start to translate cache policy used for navigation as FetchOptions::Cache.
        This allows ensuring service workers receive the right cache mode when intercepting navigation loads.
        To not change current navigation behavior, ReturnCacheDataElseLoad and ReturnCacheDataDontLoad still trigger default fetch cache mode.

        For Reload and ReloadExpiredOnly frame load types, using no-cache mode is more efficient than reload mode,
        as a conditional request will be sent if possible. This applies to location.reload which is consistent with other browsers.

        Note that Chrome does not seem to fully follow the HTML specification either, it seems to treat detached windows

        font-display:fallback can cause a visual flash (which is supposed to be impossible)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181374

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        A FontCascade represents an entire font-family fallback list, but sometimes we need to pull out a single
        representative font from the list to calculate things like line height. Previously, if the first item in
        the font-family list was in the middle of being downloaded, this representative font was hardcoded to be
        Times. However, when actually laying out and drawing the glyphs, we have logic to skip the interstitial
        Times if there are any installed fonts present in the font-family list (so you wouldn't ever actually
        see Times). This means that line height (among other things) was being calculated as if Times was used,
        but in reality, some other font from the font-family list was being used.

        Alone, this isn't a huge problem, but font-display:fallback makes a font transition between "timed out"
        and "failed," and when the font hits the failed state, the representative font skips over the cancelled
        item and hits the next item in the fallback list. This means that line heights will change, which causes
        a visual flash, even when font-display:fallback is specified.

        The solution is simply to educate the logic which identifies this representative font so that it
        understands what to do for currently-loading fonts.

        Provide a method to obtain a CSS value from a RenderStyle by CSSPropertyID
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181429

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The KeyframeEffect.getKeyframes() method from Web Animations requires that we return all styles applied at a given
        animation effect keyframe. When we parse keyframes, we create RenderStyle objects that are stored in a KeyframeList,
        as well as a list of CSSPropertyIDs that are animated. In order to provide the list of animated properties and their
        values when calling getKeyframes(), we need to be able to read back from the RenderStyle we create. As a first step
        towards this goal, we factor some code in ComputedStyleExtractor::propertyValue() out into a new method
        ComputedStyleExtractor::valueForPropertyinStyle() which takes in an explicit RenderStyle.

        No test as this is simply refactoring that doesn't change or add behavior.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181137
        <rdar://problem/35666574>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Make the dispatching of resourcetimingbufferfull event asynchronous to avoid dispatching it
        synchronously during a style resolution when CachedResourceLoader::requestImage requests
        a previously loaded image.

        We now schedule a timer when the resource timing buffer becomes full, and dispatch the event
        when the timer fires. Meanwhile, we have a backup buffer to which additional resource timing
        entries would be added. Once the event is dispatched, we refill the buffer exposed to author
        scripts. When refilling the buffer results in it becoming full again, we keep repeating the
        process of firing resourcetimingbufferfull and re-filling the buffer until either we stop
        making progress (i.e. the script didn't increase the number of empty entires in the buffer)
        or the backup buffer (at the time we started this process) becomes empty.

        Also fixed a bug that we were firing resourcetimingbufferfull event when the last entry that
        fits within the buffer size was added instead of when an entry is being added to an already
        full buffer. To make this work, the patch introduces m_resourceTimingBufferFullFlag,
        representing the concept "resource timing buffer full" flag in the resource timing specification.

        Copying, pasting, and then deleting an attachment element breaks attachment data requests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181365
        <rdar://problem/36340647>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, copying and pasting an attachment element within the same document and then deleting backwards to
        remove the pasted attachment element causes the original attachment element to be inaccessible via SPI. This is
        because there are now two different attachment elements with the same unique identifier, such that Document,
        which keeps a map of all unique attachment identifiers to attachment elements, will lose track of the original
        attachment element.

        To fix this, we ensure that attachment elements should always have unique identifiers when they are inserted
        into the document. We make several small adjustments to accomplish this:

        1.  First, refactor HTMLAttachmentElement's unique identifier so that it no longer depends on the value of the
            "webkitattachmentid" attribute, and is instead just a member of HTMLAttachmentElement that is not exposed to
            DOM bindings. This means setting and querying an attachment element's uniqueIdentifier can be done without
            triggering any side effects, such as layout or mutation events.

        2.  Next, make "webkitattachmentid" a temporary attribute similar to "webkitattachmentpath" and
            "webkitattachmentbloburl", so that it is added only when generating a markup fragment for editing, and
            removed upon deserialization.

        3.  Lastly, shift the responsibility of assigning a unique identifier to an attachment away from places where we
            create attachment elements, and instead have Document enforce this when an attachment element is inserted.

        Tests:  WKAttachmentTests.InsertAndRemoveDuplicateAttachment
                WKAttachmentTests.InsertDuplicateAttachmentAndUpdateData

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::didInsertAttachmentElement):

        Assign the unique identifier of an attachment element that has been inserted. If the identifier already tracks
        an existing attachment element in the document or is missing, reassign the identifier to a new value.

        * editing/cocoa/WebContentReaderCocoa.mm:
        (WebCore::createFragmentForImageAttachment):
        (WebCore::replaceRichContentWithAttachments):
        (WebCore::WebContentReader::readFilePaths):

        Remove calls to setUniqueIdentifier here, since Document will assign a unique identifier upon insertion.

        * editing/markup.cpp:
        (WebCore::StyledMarkupAccumulator::appendCustomAttributes):
        (WebCore::createFragmentFromMarkup):

        Set the attachment's unique identifier to the value of the "webkitattachmentid" attribute. When moving existing
        attachments around in the DOM without duplication, this ensures that the attachment will be removed and
        reinserted in the document without triggering removal and insertion client delegate methods.

        When pasting an attachment element that has the same identifier as an existing attachment, we let Document
        realize that the attachment identifier already exists, and reassign it to a unique value.

        Start to translate cache policy used for navigation as FetchOptions::Cache.
        This allows ensuring service workers receive the right cache mode when intercepting navigation loads.
        To not change current navigation behavior, ReturnCacheDataElseLoad and ReturnCacheDataDontLoad still trigger default fetch cache mode.

        For Reload and ReloadExpiredOnly frame load types, using no-cache mode is more efficient than reload mode,

        [Cairo] Use isolated fill and stroke source containers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181386

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Generate fill and stroke source objects upon invocation of various Cairo
        operations, initializing necessary data from the GraphicsContextState
        object.

        Cairo::FillSource and Cairo::StrokeSource structs are introduced, both
        being default-constructible as well as providing a constructor that
        accepts a GraphicsContextState object from which the appropriate
        resources are created.

        The FillSource and StrokeSource objects are then passed to
        PlatformContextCairo's prepareForFilling() and prepareForStroking()
        methods. Here the helper prepareCairoContextSource() function is now
        invoked with cairo_pattern_t objects as pattern or gradient sources, or
        the source color if neither cairo_pattern_t object is specified.

        The FillSource and StrokeSource constructors mimic the previous behavior
        of prepareCairoContextSource(). In case the source is a Pattern object,
        a cairo_pattern_t object is created from that. In case of FillSource,
        we also retrieve pattern size, transform and repetition information. In
        case the source os a Gradient object, we create a 'base' cairo_pattern_t
        object for a completely opaque alpha channel. Additionally, if the alpha
        value on the state is not 1, we create an alpha-adjusted cairo_pattern_t
        that is potentially used for any filling or stroking operation that has
        to preserve transparency. If neither Pattern or Gradient objects are set
        on the GraphicsContextState, we default to the current fill or stroke
        color.

        Overall, there's no change in behavior, this is simply a refactoring
        that enables us to construct Cairo objects for filling and stroking
        sources at the time of Cairo operation dispatch, instead of pulling down
        GraphicsContextState deeper into the Cairo-specific code.

        No new tests -- no change in functionality.

        Added ServiceWorkerInternals as an interface for an object exposed as self.internals in WTR.
        This object has currently one method to trigger change in the online/offline status.
        This allows writing a test for the onLine feature.

        Note that self.internals is inserted asynchronously after the script was evaluated.
        When writing a worker script using self.internals, one must make sure to use self.internals when initialized.
        online-worker.js for instance makes use of self.internals in a postMessage callback.

        [Cairo] Contain shadow blur requirement state in a separate object
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181380

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Instead of picking up the necessary state parameters from a
        GraphicsContextState object, store the necessary parameters in a helper
        ShadowBlurUsage struct. Mimicking the mustUseShadowBlur() function that
        is being removed, values of the shadow color, shadow blur, and shadow
        transform ignorance are stored there. Additionally, the required()
        method accepts a PlatformContextCairo object through which it can
        retrieve the current CTM and determine whether it's an identity, finally
        deciding whether shadow blur can or cannot be ignored.

        Goal of this change is to limit usage of GraphicsContextState directly
        in operations implemented inside the Cairo namespace. Instead, the
        state parameters should be passed directly, or an equivalent but limited
        state object should be constructed for invocation of such operations.

        This is likely only an intermediate solution. It's possible it will be
        replaced by a more complete shadow state struct that would be used for
        any operation that is required to draw shadows, if necessary.

        No new tests -- no change in functionality.

        Storage Access API: Refactor to make naming accurate and explicit, simplify access table, and prepare for access removal for page
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181357
        <rdar://problem/36331031>

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        No new tests. The only changed functionality that isn't covered
        by existing tests is cross-origin iframes in the same partition
        should be handled as already having access. This cannot be
        tested in layout tests since they don't support subdomains.

        This change does the following:
        - Changes function and message names to reflect how this feature
          was eventually implemented, i.e. access per frame.
        - Makes it explicit that the UI process is only involved in
          granting storage access and not removing storage access.
          The latter is done directly by the web process.
        - Simplifies the network process' entry map since only needs to
          be able to give access to one domain in one frame at a time.
          Access goes away on frame navigation so there can only be one
          domain at a time per frame. Also, the map now uses pageIDs as
          main keys to prepare for efficient access removal for all
          frames under a page.
        - Fixes a bug in so that a cross-origin iframe with the same
          partition as the top frame correctly is handled as already
          having access.

        Web Inspector: Capture Element Screenshot looks fuzzy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175734
        <rdar://problem/33803377>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro and Simon Fraser.

        Screenshots taken by Web Inspector were being downscaled from the
        internal size to the logical size, causing them to be blurry when
        later upscaled to the internal size.

        Replace ScaleBehavior { Scaled, Unscaled } with PreserveResolution { No, Yes }.
        This is a lot less confusing to read both inside ImageBuffer and at its use sites.

        Remove unused CoordinateSystem argument for ImageBuffer::toDataURL,
        and replace it with PreserveResolution. Plumb PreserveResolution into toCFData
        so that PreserveResolution::Yes will preserve the internal size of
        the image buffer, just as it does in other methods that take PreserveResolution.

        At the use site in InspectorPageAgent, always request PreserveResolution::Yes snapshots
        when taking an element screenshot. For now, keep using downscaled (smaller)
        snapshots when capturing canvas previews, as the previews are not full-size.

        Floats can overhang multiple blocks (they are called intruding floats).
        Each block keeps track of such intruding floats. When an overhanging float box is destroyed,
        we need to deregister it from all those blocks. We do it by walking up the ancestor block chain
        and check if the parent (grandparent etc) block still contains this float. Once we find the topmost block, 
        we start deregistering it by traversing back on the descendant blocks.
        Normally we do it in RenderElement::takeChildInternal right before the box is getting detached.
        However in certain cases (like when the float's parent happens to be an anonymous wrapper)
        by the time we get to ::takeChildInternal the subtree is already detached and we can't access all the
        ancestors.
        This patch ensure that the floating box is still attached during de-registration.

        There's a bit of code here that I kept macOS-only which deals with inserting file paths as plain text in
        editable areas, but it's unclear to me why and if WebKit clients currently find this useful, so I left a FIXME
        to investigate removing this altogether. Code for handling this plain text insertion of file paths on Mac was
        introduced in r67403.

        * platform/PasteboardStrategy.h:

        Replace getFilenamesForDataInteraction with informationForItemAtIndex. Instead of returning all of the file
        paths associated with any item on the pasteboard, fetch a PasteboardItemInfo at a given item index, which
        includes information about the file path as well as some other metadata we'll need when deciding how to read
        pasteboard contents as a document fragment.

        Teach the iOS Pasteboard to read web content using attachment elements, if enabled. There are two scenarios in
        which we would want to insert an attachment element:
        (1) The item provider uses a preferred presentation style of attachment, in which case we bail out of trying to
            handle the drop using the default mechanisms, and simply insert it as an attachment. We need this to deal
            with the case where we drop text or HTML files from the Files app, so that we don't try and insert the
            contents of the text or HTML as inline web content.
        (2) The item provider doesn't have a preferred attachment presentation style, but there's nothing WebKit would
            otherwise do with the dropped content, so insert an attachment element as a fallback. Examples where this is
            relevant are dropping a PDF or ZIP archive without attachment presentation style explicitly set.
        We first check if we fall into case (1). If so, we can bail early by inserting an attachment; otherwise, we
        proceed normally and see if we can read the contents of the drop as web content. If, at the end of default drop
        handling, we don't still have a way to represent the dropped content, enter case (2).

        Implement informationForItemAtIndex and remove filenamesForDataInteraction. As before, we ask the pasteboard
        (i.e. WebItemProviderPasteboard) for information about dropped file URLs. This time, we limit this to a single
        file, so we don't end up creating multiple attachment elements for each representation of a single item
        provider. See below for -preferredFileUploadURLAtIndex:fileType: for more detail.

        Prefer flat RTFD to RTFD. In the case where attachments are enabled and we're accepting all types of content
        using attachment elements as a fallback representation, if the source writes attributed strings to the

        com.apple.rtfd and dropping the text as an attachment element because we cannot convert the dropped content to
        markup. Instead, if flat RTFD is present in the item provider, always prefer that over RTFD so that dropping as

        [Attachment Support] Add plumbing for starting a drag with promised blob data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181201

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Adds logic to allow dragging an attachment element as a file by sending promised blob information to the UI
        process. See comments below for more detail.

        The only change in behavior is that dragging an attachment element will no longer write web content and injected
        bundle data to the pasteboard if the attachment element's file attribute is nonnull. This will cause one
        existing WK1 layout test to fail, but will otherwise not affect any attachment editing clients. On iOS,
        attachment elements in the Mail viewer can be dragged, but each attachment's file is null, so we fall back to
        current behavior; on macOS, Mail currently overrides the drag completely, beginning at -mouseDown:, so this
        doesn't make a difference to macOS Mail either.

        Storage Access API: Refactor XPC for access removal to go straight from the web process to the network process

        No new tests. Existing test re-enabled.

        This change refactors how the web process tells the network process
        to remove storage access. Previously, this was done over the UI process
        just like requests for storage access. But since no further reasoning
        is needed, the message should go straight from the web process to the
        network process for performance reasons and to minimize the risk of a
        race.

        As a consequence, the XPC code for storage access removal in the UI
        process is deleted.

        feLighting is broken with primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181197

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        With <filter primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"> we need to convert the coordinates
        of fePointLights and feSpotLights into user space coordinates. Following
        https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/filters.html#FilterElementPrimitiveUnitsAttribute
        this is done by treating them as fractions of the bounding box on the referencing
        element, with treatment for z following https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#Units_viewport_percentage
        
        To do this, store the bounds of the referencing elemenet on SVGFilterBuilder as
        targetBoundingBox, and store the primitiveUnits type. Then do the conversion of lighting
        coordinates in SVGFESpecularLightingElement::build() and SVGFEDiffuseLightingElement::build().

        Remove SVGFELightElement::findLightSource(), since we need to be able to pass the SVGFilterBuilder
        to the lightSource() function so hoist the code up.

        [Attachment Support] Introduce data structures and IPC support for writing promised blobs

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Introduces a new header containing structs to be used for writing blob data when dragging. PromisedBlobInfo
        represents information needed to declare data on the pasteboard that will eventually be provided via a Blob.
        This includes the type and filename of the Blob-backed content. PromisedBlobData represents information needed
        to actually deliver the Blob's content to the platform, and is sent some time after its corresponding
        PromisedBlobInfo. The content may either be in the form of a file path (as is the case using the previous
        declareAndWriteAttachment codepath) or a data buffer (which we would use if the Blob is not already backed by a
        file on disk).
