            This regression was caused by http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/160791 It turns out 
            that the line of code I removed was not always a no-op. In some instances, like on 
            cnn.com, it would ensure that our final scroll position after a rubber-band was 
            not something within the overhang area. It was still wrong in its assumption that 
            rubber-band is always bouncing back the spot it originated from. So this patch 
            continues to ignore the rubber-bands origin, and instead finds the nearest point 
            that is not in the overhang area, and scrolls to that point instead of the origin.

            At some scales, opaque compositing layers have garbage pixels around the edges
            ​https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124541

            Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

            Layers get marked as having opaque contents when their background is
            known to paint the entire layer. However, this failed to take into
            account two reasons why every pixel may not get painted.

            First, subpixel layout can result in non-integral RenderLayer
            bounds, which will get rounded up to an integral GraphicsLayer
            size. When this happens we may not paint edge pixels.

            Second, at non-integral scale factors, graphics context scaling
            may cause us to not paint edge pixels.

            Fix by only marking PlatformCALayers as having opaque contents
            when the contentsScale of the layer is integral.

            Not testable, because we can't guarantee to get garbage pixels
            in a ref test, and layer dumps show GraphicsLayer's notion of
            content opaqueness, not the one we set on the PlatformCALayer.

            VoiceOver is expecting that "replaced elements" (attachments in a Mail message in this case) to be
            represented by the replacement character when asking for a stringForRange.

            However, when that replaced element is at the beginning of the document, the logic does not work because
            there is a few code places that will take that first Position and advance it forward, not accounting for replaced elements.
            When using the TextIterator normally, it does account for these, so that's why it's only affecting as at the beginning of the document.

            Also a "replaced element" can be more than just renderer->isReplaced(), hence the externing of the isRendererReplacedElement method
            and using that it in pertinent places.

            No new tests, the change occurs in a code path that forces the context menu to show which
            locks up DRT if we try to test it (platform menu is shown). The change itself gives the mouse
            event handler a chance to handle our platform mouse event BEFORE the event ends up in the show
            context menu machinery. This is necessary because without it, the element will not become
            focused. Without focus, accessibility shows different/less menu items than a mouse click. The
            end result is that context menus shown via accessibility are consistent with menus shown via click.

            Fix modification of whitespace endpoints to not assume it's operating on RenderTexts

            During line layout, we use midpoints to identify RenderObjects, or parts of
            RenderObjects, that don't need InlineBoxes, usually because of collapsed whitespace.

            Prior to actually creating BidiRuns (the precursor to InlineBoxes), we use
            checkMidpoints to fix up our lineMidpointState to handle the case where we start
            ignoring spaces in our line, but don't stop until somewhere on the following line.
            Previously, this function assumed that the final midpoint (called an endpoint)
            was a RenderText, but this assumption is wrong if we have a beginning midpoint
            created by shouldSkipWhitespaceAfterStartObject (which handles inlines and list
            markers) and no endpoint on that line. In that case, we'd instead adjust the
            position backwards on the beginning midpoint, which would cause us to fail to
            create an InlineBox for the inline or list marker. In the new test added, this
            would actually trigger a crash due to an assumption when visually re-ordering
            BidiRuns that a non-empty line would actually contain at least one such run.

            MathML stretched operators by both modifying the width of the operator
            and adding children to the operator node in the render tree.

            Instead we make the operator width equal to the widest glyph possible that we use
            to represent the operator.  Additionally instead of rendering stretchy glyphs via
            stacked operator pieces in separate render tree nodes, keep only one node for the
            glyph, and use a custom paint method to paint the stacked representation.

            With this patch, rendering seems roughly equivalent on Mac and markedly better
            on Linux.

            When we have a nested isolate renderer if the outer isolate has a text
            and this text is not the first child, the isolated chain is not

            Image doesn't always repaint at high quality in all tiles after a live resize

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            Currently, ImageQualityController removes an image from its low-quality-images
            list from inside shouldPaintAtLowQuality, if this is the first paint outside
            of a live resize, but does not force the renderer to repaint in its entirety.

            However, there's no guarantee we've invalidated the whole renderer, so this can
            leave some parts of the image painted in low-quality.

            This just removes a short-circuit, instead using the ordinary high-quality-repaint
            timer to ensure that the entire renderer is repainted.

            No new test; all attempts have failed, as this depends on tiled drawing
            and a live resize occurring.

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            When starting a show on Hulu, there's a layer that gets marked as
            opaque because it has a child RenderLayer whose background fills the
            compositing layer. That child RenderLayer was recently position:fixed
            but outside the viewport, so its viewportConstrainedNotCompositedReason
            was set to a non-zero value.

            However, we failed to clear the viewportConstrainedNotCompositedReason
            when the layer became non-fixed. This caused painting the opaque
            layer to bail in RenderLayer::paintLayer(), leaving garbage.

            VoiceOver lands on Scroll views by default. It expects that the scroll view will be able to handle the focus calls. 
            We should forward scroll view focus requests to the web area to handle, which will trigger a becomeFirstResponder on WKView.

            Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

            When scrolling WebViews on Macs with Retina displays, AppKit uses
            device pixels for the scroll offset, so [scrollView() documentVisibleRect]
            can return a CGRect with non-integral origin. This rect is used by layout,
            via layoutSize(), to decide whether the view size changed, which prompts
            a full repaint. However, FrameView gets a value which has been rounded
            by enclosingIntRect(), which increases the height or width by 1px if the 
            y or x offset is on a half-pixel, causing spurious full repaints.

            Fix by plumbing through platformVisibleContentSize(), which just
            gets the size of the -documentVisibleRect.

            Inserting a rule into an empty style sheet shouldn't trigger style recalc unless necessary.

            This is kind of a cheesy optimization, but it turns out that the use case is quite common.
            The pattern goes like this:

                (1) Create <style> element.
                (2) Add it to the document's <head>.
                (3) .addRule() one rule through the CSSOM API.

            Prior to this patch, (3) would always cause a full (deferred) style recalc.

            Now that we exclude empty style sheets from the document's (effective) active set,
            we can piggyback on the style invalidation analysis when transitioning from an empty
            sheet to a single-rule sheet.

            In other words, add a special code path for the first rule insertion into an empty,
            in-document style sheet to minimize the amount of invalidation that happens.

            This avoids unnecessary work when removing a <link> that refers to an empty style sheet.

            Some Facebook pages have a <link rel="stylesheet" href="data:text/css;base64,"> that gets
            removed during the initial page load, causing style recalc.

                Use DeferRecalcStyleIfNeeded. Since the style sheet is being removed, it will either
                cause a recalc (because it's no longer in the set of active sheets) or do nothing.

            Teach DocumentStyleSheetCollection to filter out empty style sheets when deciding whether
            or not to trigger a style recalc. We can then be clever when an empty style sheet is removed
            from the document, and avoid causing extra work.

            Some pages use this pattern:

                (1) Create a <style> element.
                (2) Add it to the document's <head> element.
                (3) Insert some CSS as a text child of the <style> element.

            Since the <style> element is already inside the document at (3), we had to treat this as an
            old style sheet being removed, even though it was just an empty sheet of nothing.

            With this patch, Document gains enough smarts to know that removing/adding an empty sheet
            won't affect layout/rendering in any meaningful way, thus a style recalc can be avoided.

            This patch fixes all of the various writing-mode and pagination combinations
            so that the columns are painted in the correct location. The code that sets up
            the initial painting translation offset in the block direction and that advances
            that offset has been pulled into two helper functions, initialBlockOffsetForPainting
            and blockDeltaForPaintingNextColumn, and that code is now shared by the four call
            sites that need it (painting and hit testing in RenderBlock and painting and hit testing
            in RenderLayer).

            This patch also backs out the maximumScrollPosition change, since it only occurred because
            of incorrect sizing of the RenderView, and this sizing issue has now been corrected by
            ensuring that computeLogicalHeight() always makes sure you are the size of the viewport
            and does not shrink you to the column height.

            There was also a race condition that caused pagination to be incorrect if layout occurred
            before the html/body renderer that set the writing-mode were available. When this happened,
            the writing mode got propagated up to the view, but the column styles didn't get
            adjusted to compensate for the writing mode change.

            Added tests for every pagination and writing-mode combination in fast/multicol/pagination.

            (WebCore::FrameView::maximumScrollPosition):

            (WebCore::RenderBlock::checkForPaginationLogicalHeightChange):
            Patch the column code that sets up the initial page height to use the pagination API's
            page height rather than the viewport logical height. This allows the view to still match
            the viewport in dimensions rather than being incorrectly sized to the column height.

            Two new helper functions used to set up the block direction paint/hit testing translation.
            The major bug fix that occurred in this code is that the old block axis code didn't handle
            reversal correctly and it also used physical coordinates to try to determine the translation
            offset, when you really need to use logical coordinates in the original writing mode coordinate

            VoiceOver relies on object replacement characters being emitted when asking for selected text.
            This has worked if a real <img> is used, but if role="img" is used on a <div>, for example,
            no emission is performed, which leads to missed elements in text.

            Deferring layer flushes can cause painting without layout being done
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118493

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            r147797 added a mechanism for the TileController to inform RenderLayerCompositor
            that it had performed an action (setNeedsDisplay, etc.) that would cause CoreAnimation
            to call back into us to paint in this runloop, and that it shouldn't throttle the next
            layer flush.

            However, if tiles were created and left unparented (because the TileController was
            out-of-window), when they are later parented, we failed to inform RenderLayerCompositor
            that they were about to call back for painting, and so it would happily throttle the
            next layer flush, and layout would be out of date, and garbage and corruption could result.

            To resolve this, rework the logic surrounding parenting existing-but-unparented tiles
            to ensure that they get added to the TileController's dirtyRect.

            No new tests; the bug only reproduces under specific timing circumstances, and
            manifests itself as an assertion failure or garbage on the screen, so it's quite
            hard to make a workable test.

            - If the tile is dirty and needed to be parented (because either it's new
                or hadn't been parented before), add it to the dirty rect list.

            When we click on the snapshotted plugin to start it, we mimic what would happen to the plugin
            normally by dispatching another click event on top of where we just clicked.
            However, we were sending the click event before setting the state to Playing which meant that our
            simulated click was not being handled. 
            We should be setting this state before sending the click, not after.

            Add a semi-hard cap of 8192 selectors per CSS rule. Rules with longer selector lists will be split into
            multiple rules (with 8192 selectors per rule.) The style properties are shared behind the scenes
            so it's all pretty efficient.

            This does generate a different CSSOM for gigantic selector lists, I've added a test to document this.
            Note that setting CSSStyleRule.selectorText with over 8192 selectors will now fail, the splitting into

            constrainScrollPositionForOverhang needs to handle scrollOrigin correctly

            Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

            Test: compositing/geometry/fixed-position-flipped-writing-mode.html

            WebCore makes use of constrainScrollPositionForOverhang not only for
            constraining fixed- and sticky-positioned elements to the viewport, but
            also for clamping the tile cache's visible rect.

            Therefore, constrainScrollPositionForOverhang needs to correctly take
            the scrollOrigin into account. The easiest way I saw to do this was to
            reimplement the function in terms of a pair of rect intersections
            between a virtual scrollable "viewport" and the document (with a bit
            of complication from headers and footers).

            The first intersection is performed, then if the viewport doesn't fit,
            it is pushed down and to the right, from the origin. Next, we intersect
            again, this time pushing the rect up by the amount it overflowed the document
            rect from the bottom right. This performs effectively the same constraint
            as previously, but handles the scrollOrigin correctly and is also somewhat
            easier to read and understand (with pictures).

            meaning the underlying data will be copied in a neuter scenario rather than transferred. This

            In WebKit2, Widgets have no platformWidget, so trying to get to the
            NSScreen via the platform widget's window never succeeded, and we always
            fell back on getting info for the main display.

            However, we were already pushing the WKView's displayID down to the
            WebProcess for the requestAnimationFrame infrastructure, so use that.

            Add a virtual function on Widget windowDisplayID(), that is overridden
            in FrameView to return the PlatformDisplayID which Page has.

            Add a utility category on NSScreen to get an NSScreen's displayID, and to
            find an NSScreen given a displayID.

            Sticky elements are missing or misplaced sometimes when reloading a page that scrolls to a named anchor

            Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

            At the end of FrameView::performPostLayoutTasks() we call scrollToAnchor() which attempts
            to restore the scroll position to a named anchor, even when the document has been
            changed by layout. This ends up in a call to ScrollView::scrollTo(), which in turn
            calls repaintFixedElementsAfterScrolling(). However, repaintFixedElementsAfterScrolling()
            would bail if m_nestedLayoutCount != 0, so we never updated layer positions which
            depend on scroll position (but which would not be updated by layout, since their
            renderers are not marked for layout when scrolling happens).

            We've solved this problem once before in updateFixedElementsAfterScrolling() which
            checks for m_nestedLayoutCount <= 1, so that we do work on the outermost nested layout.
            Apply that same fix to repaintFixedElementsAfterScrolling().

            Very timing-dependent, so hard to make a test.

        r147612 added setNeedsLayout(true, MarkOnlyThis) for
        TextControlInnerTextElement renderer. It's ok for input[type=text]
        because RenderTextControlSingleLine also has needsLayout flag, and it
        has only the inner text renderer as a child.

        As for input[type=search], it doesn't work. Renderer structure for
        input[type=search] is:

        RenderTextControlSingleLine
        └Renderer for TextControlInnerContainer
          └Renderer for TextControlInnerElement
            └Renderer for TextControlInnerTextElement

        After r147612, there is a case that only RenderTextControlSingleLine
        and TextControlInnerTextElement renderer have needsLayout flag, and
        others don't.  It won't trigger layout for
        TextControlInnerTextElement renderer.

        We should set needsLayout flags of TextControlInnerContainer renderer
        and TextControlInnerElement renderer by MarkContainingBlockChain.

        Synthesized vertical italics on rotated glyphs are transformed incorrectly

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        If a font does not have italic glyphs, and is in a vertical flow, then
        the synthesis of italics was skewing in the wrong direction. While here,
        ensure that no CJK text will get italics in vertical layout.

        This is a topic under discussion in the CSS Working Group. The resolution
        at the June 2013 face-to-face was that:
        - italics in Japanese (and Chinese) text are rare in vertical layout
        - most people wanted Latin text to italicize in the direction of the line flow

        The final behaviour was left undefined, but we consider the change here
        to be sufficient for now. In all cases, the best solution is to avoid
        synthesized italics by specifying a font that includes such forms.

        This patch prepares more quickly the texture when the video frame is
        already in the GPU memory.

        It is done using a new buffer's metadata available in GStreamer 1.2,
        and its purpose is to upload buffers into a OpenGL texture.

        If the decoder provides buffers with this metadata, the buffer will be
        uploaded into the texture used for the video display and it will be
        rendered, avoiding a expensive mem copies. This is particularly useful
        for Full HD videos, where all the processing and display will be done

        [CSS Shapes] Consider bottom borders when calculating the position of the overflow

        When you have a shape and the content overflows from the shape we need to push the overflow below the content box,
        not below the border box. We didn't consider the bottom borders of the content box, now I fixed it too and the overflow
        just starts after the content box. I added a new helper function called pushShapeContentOverflowBelowTheContentBox. Now
        both the shape in flow thread and the shape overflow use the same function. I added a new test and modified the existing

        FrameView is aware that "slow-repaint objects" (i.e. renderers with 
        background-attachment:fixed) require a slow-scrolling path. However,
        it was ignorant of the fact that such objects could be painting into
        compositing layers; it simply dirtied the main tiles, and nothing else.
        
        Fix by having FrameView track the slow-repaints objects explicitly, as we
        do for position:fixed, and repaint each of them on scrolling.

        as well. This could be optimized later.

        Painting of fixed background images is wrong in composited layers

        The code that computed background image geometry for background-attachment:fixed
        images was unaware of compositing, so often painting the image at the wrong location.
        
        Fix by having RenderBoxModelObject::calculateBackgroundImageGeometry() do the correct
        math for fixed backgrounds in composited layer by offsetting the viewport rect by
        the paint container's absolute position.

        a background is fixed, since computing the correct extent would require finding
        the appropriate composited ancestor to pass to calculateBackgroundImageGeometry().
        This is OK since this function is used for "background opaque" optimizations.

        If the changed image is related to a fixed background, geometry.hasNonLocalGeometry()

        backgrounds. geometry.setHasNonLocalGeometry() is set for fixed backgrounds to indicate
        to callers that, if they didn't pass a paint container, the destRect is not accurate.
        The main bug fix is also here: we move the viewportRect by the absolute location of
        paint container, which is equivalent to the composited layer offset.

        Threaded HTML parser can ASSERT in some situations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117662

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This patch merges https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/3c0a112b42d72c7623f78463166dd7f04d680b4c

        --->8---
        The parser is supposed to stop processing data when there's a pending
        location change, but before this CL we would actually process the first
        token from every chunk when there was a pending location change.

        If the first token in a chunk was a "script" start tag, that would put
        the tree builder into TextMode, which can only process character
        tokens. If the next chunk starts with another start tag token, the tree
        builder would be sad and hit an ASSERT.

        This CL reorders a couple lines in HTMLDocumentParser so that we check
        for pending location changes before processing any tokens. This change
        stops us from processing the first token from each chunk while there is
        a pending location change.

        This issue can reproduce on any platform, but it reproduced often on
        Android because mobile markup often elides spaces between consecutive
        script tags. If there are space characters between the script tags,
        then those space characters will be the first ones processes in the
        chunk, which doesn't trigger the ASSERT.
        ---8<---

        Since we landed this patch in Blink, we've been able to reproduce this
        issue on desktops as well. I spoke with rniwa in #webkit and he said

        parser but that it was probably worth merging this patch anyway.

        Editing: wrong text position when you click enter on the text behind the image
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115023

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        When trying to break a line after an image followed by some text, contrary
        to the expected behavior the text doesn't move to a new line, instead, the
        caret position just shifts to the end of line.

        As per the existing implementation for inserting a paragraph separator,
        the insertion position obtained corresponds to the point after the image
        element.
        Since the insertion position doesn't resolve to being offset in the
        following text node (0 offset), no splitting of text occurs and the block
        to be inserted is placed after the containing (start) block (thereby
        causing the caret position to shift).

        If the computed insertionPosition points to an element that shall be
        ignored for editing purposes (i.e. cannot have a VisiblePosition inside
        it), and the position lies either at the start or at the end of such
        an element, we should move our Position either upstream or
        downstream (respectively) so as to obtain a valid position which can
        be used further for splitting of the text.

        [BlackBerry] LayerTiler fails to tile really big layers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117211

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        PR 273550

        The cause for this bug was that LayerTiler computed which tiles are
        visible by exhaustively mapping every tile to normalized device
        coordinates and checking if it intersected the viewport. If there was a
        lot of tiles, it would get stuck in this loop, iterating over all
        tiles, for a very long time. Also, the visibility information was
        transferred to the WebKit thread using mutexes, which added unnecessary
        mutex contention to the mix.

        Fixed by doing the reverse calculation, unprojecting the visible part
        of the layer to layer coordinate space to find which tiles are visible.
        Instead of doing a traditional unprojection of point to line and see
        where the line intersects the layer, this patch uses the w-coordinates
        of triangle vertices to perform "perspective correct texturing" of the
        intersection points in device space, which is equivalent to
        unprojection since perspective correct texturing computes a 2D
        coordinate in (normalized) layer coordinate space which is easily
        scaled up to the layer bounds and get the visible region expressed in
        layer coordinate space.

        The visible area is approximated by a rectangle, and a set of tiles
        needing render are added to the mix, and  we have a swappable data
        structure so visbility can be transferred to WebKit thread without
        mutexes, but instead using atomic swap.

        No new tests, covered by existing tests.

        [BlackBerry] Accelerated compositing layers that intersect the image plane are incorrectly transformed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117067

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        PR 273550

        The BlackBerry port used to mathematically project each corner of each
        layer bounds rectangle, which gives the wrong results when the layer
        intersects the image plane.

        For display lists, we still got the correct appearance of the layer
        contents, since the display list results in geometry that's transformed
        in the vertex shader, on the GPU.

        However, the transformed bounds are used for drawing the debug border,
        performing visibility calculations on the CPU and drawing of WebGL,
        masks/reflections and filters. Using the mathematical projection of
        points that lie behind the image plane gives the wrong results.

        The most important consequence of this bug was that the wrong area of
        the layer would be considered visible, so a tiled layer would not
        populate the right tiles (or any tiles at all).

        Fixed by implementing something along the lines of the recipe in
        section 6.2 of http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms.

        No new tests, manually testable by enabling debug border on
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/the-box/launch.

        Avoid unnecessary data copies when loading subresources with DoNotBufferData option
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115804

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When DoNotBufferData option is used to load a resource its data
        is always copied before sending it to the CachedResource. Most
        of the cached resources ignore the incremental data and wait
        until all data has been received to save the ResourceBuffer,
        that will be NULL anyway when DoNotBufferData is used.
        CachedRawResource notifies its clients about the incremental
        data, but it doesn't save the data when DoNotBufferData option
        is present. In those cases we are unnecessary copying the data.

        CachedResource::data has been split into
        CachedResource::addDataBuffer() used for incremental data chunks
        when buffering data, CachedResource::addData() used for
        incremental data chunks when not buffering and
        CachedResource::finishLoading() used to finish the loading. This
        way we get rid of the allDataReceived boolean parameter and cached
        resources not interested in incremenetal data chunks only have to
        implement finishLoading() without having to check if all data have
        been received or not.

        SubresourceLoader::sendDataToResource was always called after
        checking if loading multipart content, and then it was checked
        again to decided whether to copy the data or not. It has been
        removed in favor of calling directly the resource methods,
        finishLoading for multipart content, addDataBuffer for data chunks
        when buffering and addData for data chunks when not buffering.

        No new functionality, covered by existing tests.

        Sometimes we stick in slow scrolling mode even after leaving a page

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.
        
        ScrollingCoordinator, and thus the scrolling state tree, is owned by Page,
        and so persists when navigating between cached pages. We do give the ScrollingStateTree
        a new ScrollingStateScrollingNode on navigation, however the ScrollingStateScrollingNode
        would not have dirty flags set for, say, WheelEventHandlerCount if the document had
        no wheel handlers. And because that dirty flag wasn't set, ScrollingTree::commitNewTreeState()
        would fail to update m_hasWheelEventHandlers, so we'd remain in slow scrolling.
        
        Fix by having ScrollingStateTree remember if it's been given a new root ScrollingStateScrollingNode,
        and making ScrollingTree::commitNewTreeState() to the right thing in that case.
        
        Also fix a couple of issues with the tiled scrolling indicator. First, on cached page
        navigation, the indicator color would show the state for the old page, because
        ScrollingCoordinatorMac::commitTreeState() checked scrollingTree()->hasWheelEventHandlers()
        before the scrolling thread has committed the new scrolling tree.
        
        Second, the color change would animate, so stop that.

        Not testable, since tests can only dump the scrolling state tree.

        Column balancing support in the region based multicol implementation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116033

        Start by setting the column height to the flow thread's height divided
        by the number of columns. Then stretch the column height until
        contents fits without creating overflowing columns, or until the
        maximum allowed column height is reached, whichever comes first. This
        may require several layout iterations (but normally only a
        couple). For each time we stretch, stretch by the least amount
        required to make a difference to which box goes where.

        Also make sure that the columns get tall enough to honor orphans
        and widows settings.

        This change takes some tiny steps in preparing for multiple column
        set support. There is also some minor cleanup and bugfixing; see
        details below.

        Whitespace between inlines with nowrap and a shrink-to-fit parent gets a line-break when it shouldn't

        Test: fast/text/whitespace/inline-whitespace-wrapping-8.html

        A no-wrap inline shouldn't include trailing space when deciding whether it fits on a line. 
        Likewise when we finish iterating through the objects on a line we should clear our linebreak
        if the only thing that prevents us fitting on the line is our collapsed trailing whitespace.
         
        Removing the trailing space from this measurement means we need to watch out for potential
        breaks between no-wrap inlines, in particular if we leave a no-wrap inline ignoring spaces
        and enter an autowrap inline then we need to mark the beginning of the autowrap inline
        as a potential linebreak. The test fast/text/whitespace/inline-whitespace-wrapping-5.html 
        is an example of such a case.

        [CSS Shapes] rectangle and inset-rectangle do not properly handle rx and ry
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116745

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        If ry is not supplied, it now defaults to the rx value. Also, if rx
        and ry are not supplied, they default to 0px. This also has the effect
        that the computed style for any rectangle or inset-rectangle now
        contains all six parameters.

        If rx > width/2 then it is clamped to width/2, and if ry > height/2,
        then it is clamped to height/2. This happens at layout time because
        given mixed units and relative units, that is the only time this
        determination can be made.

        Paint the region content (from RenderFlowThread) during the background phase instead of the

        Let's assume there is a region and a sibling element. The sibling partially overlaps the
        region and appears after the region in DOM order.

        Before this patch, we would paint in this order:
        1) Region background
        2) Sibling background
        3) Region content
        4) Sibling content

        As a result, the sibling background would incorrectly paint between the region
        background and the region content. Instead, the sibling background should paint over the
        region background and the region content.

        After this patch, we paint in this order:
        1) Region background
        2) Region content

        Positioned Replaced Elements That Aren't RenderReplaced get Incorrect Width
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93735

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Replaced elements that aren't RenderReplaced aren't |isReplaced| and don't have an 
        intrinsic height or width. This causes them to go down the wrong height and width computation
        path in RenderBox when they are absolute positioned. 
        
        The notion of |isReplaced| is entwined with the notion of being |isInline| so it isn't really 
        possible to make them isReplaced without re-wiring a lot of code. So instead use an ad-hoc definition
        of isReplacedElement in RenderBox to bring all replaced elements into the height and width calculation.
        To make sure we get the right height and width in there, give non-RenderReplaced replaced renderers
        the helpers for returning their approximation of intrinsic height and width.

        Scrolling with platformWidget and delegateScrolling is incorrectly clamped
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117369
        <rdar://problem/13985064>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The patch http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/142526 clamps the input position
        in the ScrollView scroll range. This was done for the path to the ScrollingCoordinator.

        The problem with that change is ScrollView::setScrollPosition() can delegate the scrolling
        to either a platformWidget, or through delegateScrolling. After r142526, the position is clamped,
        and we do not let those external scrolling mechanims handle the out-of-bound scrolling.

        This patch fixes the issue by moving the threaded scrolling call to ScrollView,
        after the delegate handling code.

        [CSS Regions] Layers inside the RenderFlowThread should be collected by the layer of RenderView
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117270

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        RenderNamedFlowThreads are attached to the RenderView, but they are painted 
        and hit-tested through their regions. The easiest way to prevent the RenderView 
        from seeing the RenderNamedFlowThreads as its own children was to avoid collecting
        the layers of the RenderNamedFlowThreads as children layers of the RenderView.

        However, most of the code is analyzing the layers tree starting from the root,
        so having the RenderNamedFlowThread participate in the layer tree is needed
        in order to enable compositing for layers inside the flow thread.

        This patch makes the RenderNamedFlowThread visible to the RenderView, but
        ignores it when iterates the children of the RenderView in paint and hit-test methods.

        No new tests, no visible changes.

        Get rid of outdated raises() from Web IDL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117350

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Stop using "raises()" in the IDL as this is no longer part of the Web IDL
        specification. Web IDL no longer specifies exceptions for operations. Instead
        it is now explained in prose.

        WebKit still needs to know if the method can throw an exception (but does not
        need the exception name) so this patch adds a WebKit specific IDL extended
        attribute: [RaisesException]. The naming is consistent with Blink.

        This results in more standard and concise IDL. This also simplifies a lot
        the code of the IDL parser.

        No new tests, no behavior change.

        Reviewed by Mark Rowe.

        In r150114 we tried to make the WebCoreTestShim target build on iOS by
        excluding its only source file from the build. While this allowed the
        target to build, it prevented the target's product (WebCoreTestShim.dylib)
        from being created. This causes xcodebuild to fail if you ask it to
        install the target.

        Fix this by building the target's product on iOS. Just use the
        preprocessor to exclude the bits that won't build on iOS.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The bug was caused by Font::width caching the width of text even when the font fallbacks existed when fallbackFonts
        argument was null; because of this, a later call to Font::width was returning the width without filling up
        fallbackFonts even if it was not null this time.

        Fixed the bug by adding a local fallback fonts hash set, and checking the emptiness of this variable in Font::width.
        Also added pass fallbackFonts around in various places to make use of the cached font fallbacks.

        No new tests. Unfortunately I haven't been able to make a reliable reduction for this bug.

        [CSSRegions] getBoundingClientRect wrong for inline content nodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117290

        Reviewed by Alexandru Chiculita.

        getBoundingClientRect returned incorrect values for inline content that
        was directly flowed inside regions because its mapLocalToContainer was not
        properly patched as its RenderBox counterpart. This patch adds mapLocalToContainer
        method in RenderFlowThread so that is properly called for all the elements inside the
        flow thread.

        Also, modified offsetFromContainer so that if the container is the flow thread,
        offsetDependsOnPoint is set to true which further sets RenderGeometryMapStep::m_isNonUniform
        to true for each step added in pushMappingToContainer methods.

        :hover style not applied on hover if its display property is different from original style's
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7555

        Properly apply the :hover pseudo-class when reattaching is required (e.g. when changing the display type)

        A new AttachContext class was created to be passed along as an optional parameter to the attach/detach/reattach methods.
        This new parameter is used to:
            - prevent the element from being removed from the list of hovered/active elements upon detach when a reattach is in progress
            - prevent the style from being incorrectly computed (due to the previous point)
            - prevent the style from being computed twice (the attach() method used to recompute it)

        Special care was required to the case when display:none is specified in the :hover class. Enabling the :hover style
        was leaving the element without a renderer, which was causing it to remain stuck in the :hover state (subsequent mouseMove
        events were not able to reset the element to its normal style due to the fact that it had no renderer).

        The DragController::startDrag method was updated to properly handle the case when dragImage is NULL 
        (for instance by setting display:none inside the -webkit-drag pseudo-class).

        Coordinated Graphics : Refactor CoordinatedSurface to manage the lifecycle of GraphicsContext
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108899

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        This is a preparation patch for Threaded Coordinated Graphics.

        This patch changes CoordinatedSurface to be responsible for the
        lifecycle of GraphicsContext used in Coordinated Graphics System.
        CoordinatedImageBacking and UpdateAtlas do not ask for the ownership
        of GraphicsContext anymore. Instead, those classes use client pattern to
        ask the CoordiantedSurface to paint to the GraphicsContext.

        This refactoring is needed to implement CoordinatedSurface for Threaded
        Coordinated Graphics.

        The HTML parser breaks up large text nodes into small chunks to avoid some
        O(n^2) editing algorithms. This fix skips that workaround for <script> and
        <style> elements, which aren't likely to need editing. As a result, <script>
        ends up with a single text node, containing a contiguous String, which is the
        source code of that inline script block.

        Prior this fix, we could end up with two copies of large inline scripts: one
        monolithic string retained by JSC and a number of shards retained by the DOM.
        After this fix, both the DOM and JSC use the same monolithic string, removing a

        There is an early return from TimelineMemoryOverview.update() when

        [CSS Regions] REGRESSION Incorrect layer clipping inside flow thread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117074

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Function RenderBox::mapLocalToContainer was adapted for elements inside flow threads to convert
        elements coordinates to RenderView coordinates, passing through the region in which the elements
        were flowed (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66641).

        The fix for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76486 modified RenderLayer::calculateClipRects and replaced
        convertToLayerCoords with localToContainerPoint, which further calls mapLocalToContainer.

        However, for elements inside the flow thread, which acts as a root layer for its collected children, we do not want
        to get the offset in RenderView coordinates but rather in flow thread coordinates (and still take transforms into
        account). This patch modifies RenderBox::mapLocalToContainer so that it stops at flow thread boundary when the passed
        repaintContainer is the flow thread. The flow thread is the container for repaint for elements inside it, as seen from
        RenderObject::containerForRepaint.

        No new tests, converted overflow-size-change-with-stacking-context and overflow-size-change-with-stacking-context-rtl
        into ref tests so that the we do not rely on pixel tests in the future.

        The MemoryInfo interface is not a subject of any specification and should not be exposed

        internals, accessible through window.internals.memoryInfo.

        The jsHeapSizeLimit attribute is removed from the MemoryInfo interface as that value was
        only usable when using the V8 bindings which are not supported anymore. A small fast/harness

        Automatically generate WorkerContext constructor attributes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117183

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        Add [GlobalContext=WindowOnly|WorkerOnly|WindowAndWorker] IDL extended attribute
        to indicate to the bindings generator on which global context the constructor
        attribute should be generated for interfaces without [NoInterfaceObject]:
        - WindowOnly: only on the global Window object (default if ommitted)
        - WorkerOnly: only on the worker context
        - WindowAndWorker: On both the global Window object and the worker context

        This covers all the current use cases.

        The JSC bindings generator now automatically generates the Constructor attributes
        on the WorkerContext for non-callback interfaces which do not have the
        [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute but have [GlobalContext=WorkerOnly|WindowAndWorker]
        extended attribute.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Mozilla have updated their version of CheckedInt and suggested
        we sync. Here are the improvements:

        - CheckedInt now consistently rejects unsupported types. Before, you
        could sometimes construct a CheckedInt from an unsupported type (like,
        float) or multiply a CheckedInt by a float, and have it not caught! See
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=869194
         - Fixed a possibility of undefined behavior in unary operator-. See bug
        https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=849666
         - CheckedInt now supports the "long long" and "unsigned long long"
        types. We don't like "long long" (and neither does the Google C++ style
        guide!) but we had to do that because libogg exposes typedefs to those
        types. See Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=869685
         - CheckedInt also now supports "signed char" in addition to "char" ---
        they are not the same type! See Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=847521
         - Fixed and simplified usage of CheckedInt outside of Mozilla. You'll

        selectionStart/selectionEnd return "obsolete" values when requested during "input" event
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110742

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This patch defers firing "webkitEditableContentChanged" until new
        selection is applied to control. This makes selection during "input"
        more consistent and reliable.

        Background: "input" event is fired by "webkitEditableContentChanged"
        dispatcher. But "input" is scoped event, so under some conditions its
        dispatching may be deferred. When "input" dispatching is deferred,
        dispatcher observes updated selectionStart and selectionEnd.
        Otherwise values repersent state before applying editing command.

        So, to make selectionStart/End to be more predictable and useful, we
        need either always dispatch "input" before selection is updated, or
        always dispatch "input" after selection is updated.

        As it was mentioned, dispatching could be deferred by scoping. So
        dispatching before updating selection couldn't be guaranteed.
        Moreover, it will be hard to calculate updated selection in user
        code. On the other side - old selection could be easily tracked.

        So, it looks logically that we should guarantee dispatching "input"
        after updating selection. There are no execution paths in
        "webkitEditableContentChanged" dispatched that depends on current
        selection. So it is safe to fire this event after selection is updated.

        Rename 'KURL::elidedString' and inspector's 'String.prototype.trimMiddle' for clarity.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111700

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Darin suggested that 'KURL::elidedString' is inaccurately named[1], this
        patch is an attempt to do better. It additionally brings the Inspector's
        'String.prototype.trimMiddle' method into line, as the two methods do
        more or less the same thing.

        After a bit of discussion with Maciej and Daniel Bates on IRC, I've
        settled on 'KURL::stringCenterEllipsizedToLength(unsigned)' and
        'String.prototype.centerEllipsizedToLength(number)' respectively.

        No new tests are added, as this patch shouldn't have any visible effect
        on the web. It's strictly an internal refactoring.

        Fix paint-related milestones to not fire when the layer tree is frozen
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117012

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        In the previous code, it was possible to paint some layer and schedule
        the m_paintRelatedMilestonesTimer, but then the layer tree was put into
        a frozen state because the page redirected. However, the paint-related
        milestones timer would still fire. This caused woes with header/footer
        banners.
        
        Fix by not firing paint-related milestones if the layer tree is frozen,
        which we know via a new ChromeClient callback. When unfrozen, we'll
        paint again, and fire the timer later.

        Add a special case for SelectorDataList::execute when there is only one selector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116891

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        In the vast majority of cases, querySelector is called with a single selector.

        This patch takes that input into account to improve the performance of
        SelectorDataList::execute(). For the case of a single selector, we avoid three
        branches executed for every node of the traversal.

        This improves QuerySelector's time by 2.3%.

        PODArena is a risky class to use since it doesn't return memory to the system unless the arena object is destroyed.
        This was the reason why PODFreeListArea was added. An upcoming patch will merge PODArena with PODFreeListArena and

        then browsed around a variety of web sites to collect data. The 99% percentile
        of DataVector lengths was just shy of 250 characters. I rounded that up to 256

        Fix the firing of m_paintRelatedMilestonesTimer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116919

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r150671 intended to change things so that paint-related milestones
        only fire when painting has actually happened, so that WebKit clients
        are notified when we actually have bits to present.
        
        However, it made an incorrect assumption that painting would happen
        inside of flushCompositingState(). This is not the case; flushCompositingState()
        will just dirty CALayers, and later on Core Animation will ask us to paint them.
        
        This incorrect assumption meant that we would never start the
        m_paintRelatedMilestonesTimer, so never fire the milestones.
        
        Fix by starting the m_paintRelatedMilestonesTimer via the RenderLayerBacking
        paintContents call back. At this time we know we're painting, so we can both
        set the FrameView's last paint time, and start up the timer. We also only
        want to start the timer if there are pending milestones.

        Share FontGlyphs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116863

        Reviewed by Anreas Kling.

        Style system generates many Font objects that are identical or similar enough to have identical FontGlyphs. 
        We can figure out that the FontGlyphs are going to be the same and share them. This reduces memory usage.
        It also improves performance as the glyph cache and the width cache hang from FontGlyphs and their hit rate
        increases.
        
        On PLT3 this takes the number of live FontGlyphs at the end from 40k+ to <1k. Width cache hit rate improves
        from ~42% to ~55%.

        [BlackBerry] backface-visibility: hidden doesn't work properly with masks and filters
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116616

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        The BlackBerry::Platform::Graphics::GraphicsContext generates geometry
        with a different winding order than the accelerated compositing backend
        of the BlackBerry port. So, when we switched from Skia to this new
        rendering engine, we switched from glFrontFace(GL_CCW) to
        glFrontFace(GL_CW), and all was well when drawing display lists.
        However, we forgot to update the winding order of geometry generated
        within the accelerated compositing backend, which is used for masks and
        filters, so they were getting erroneously culled out when
        backface-visibility: hidden was applied to them. Fixed by switching the
        winding order of all geometry generated up here, which has the added
        benefit of enabling us to use TransformationMatrix::mapQuad instead of
        transforming point-by-point.

        To further complicate matters, a right-side up transform is used when
        drawing layers into surfaces, reversing the winding order and requiring
        us to switch back to glFrontFace(GL_CCW) temporarily, when drawing
        layers to surfaces, or the layers will get culled out inside the
        surface.

        Also fix spelling error, "drawed" should be "drawn".

        No new tests, this is only detectable by pixel tests, which the
        BlackBerry port currently doesn't support.

        Added a new rule "declaration_recovery:" which covers any kind of
        "invalid_block_list maybe_space" sequence. By appending this new
        rule to every rule reductable to "declaration:" we can remove some
        redundant rules and improve error recovery of some others that
        were only accepting exactly one error.

        One of the rules being removed was preventing invalid blocks in a
        declaration to invalidate the whole declaration. The rule was
        reporting the syntax error but at the same time accepting the
        invalid block as part of a valid declaration.

        Web Inspector: Enable CSS logging
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113401

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        From Blink r149265 by <serya@chromium.org>

        CSS logging was disabled in r147028 to prevent message overflow in
        the inspector console. This change restores it by modifying the
        CSS grammar in order to reduce as much consecutive errors as
        possible in 'declaration_list' and 'decl_list' rules.

        This way, for rules like 'x { color: ### }' only the first '#'
        will be reported as error (instead of 3 identical errors).

        The rule 'declaration' still produces multiple errors, because it
        does not eat as much errors as possible. So in order not to create
        a complex risky patch we just disable logging in the parser for
        that rule.

        [BlackBerry] Reveal HTTP error code for XHR even if there is no response body

        It's a regression introduced by r132556.
        BlackBerry is doing friendly HTTP error handling: if there is no response body
        for an HTTP error it will display an error message made by the port. But for a
        XHR request, which usually does not result in displaying error messages to the
        end user, HTTP error code should be revealed to let the JavaScript know what
        the actual server error code is.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116094

        Reviewed by Tor Arne Vestbø.

        The events are first sent properly but Flash then immediately repaints
        and this causes flickering painting.
        The issue is that Flash seems to be doing some input event tracking of
        its own internally, using the HWND returned through NPN_GetValue(NPNVnetscapeWindow).

        We are currently using two coordinate systems for windowless plugins on Windows with Qt:
        - FrameView coordinates: Used for input events and ajusted with the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message
        - Drawable coordinates: Used by WM_PAINT and adjusted with NPP_SetWindow

        This patch fixes the bug by mapping input events to the native window returned
        as NPNVnetscapeWindow instead of the FrameView to ensure that those coordinates will match
        the ones used by Flash internally.
        With this we shouldn't be using FrameView coordinates anywhere for windowless plugins
        on Windows with Qt.

        [CSS Regions] Remove the offsetFromLogicalTopOfFirstPage parameter from layout functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116441

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The patch changes the following things:
        - exposes offsetFromLogicalTopOfFirstPage() to all the RenderBoxes;
        - offsetFromLogicalTopOfFirstPage() is now safe to call from any box inside a flow thread, not only the
        currently being laid out;
        - removes the offsetFromLogicalTopOfFirstPage parameter from all the layout functions
        that didn't actually required it; when the value is necessary, the offsetFromLogicalTopOfFirstPage
        function is called instead;
        - RenderFlowThread now handles its own logic for obtaining the offset from logical top of the first
        region for a box, based on the layout states pushed on RenderView; it provides a better caching mechanism
        that can be used for all the ancestor containing blocks of the current box being laid out.

        The RenderBoxRegionInfo structures are cached only based on the box and the region. This means that
        passing around a value for offsetFromLogicalTopOfFirstPage different in some cases than others was
        risky. If there is a possibility of having a different box info result for a different offset
        then the cache is not working correctly.

        Tests: No function change, no tests.

        Mac: Set the default audio buffer size to a large value for <video> elements.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116342

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.
        Roll-in rubber stamped by Eric Carlson.

        To enable power savings by waking up the audio hardware less often, set the
        requested buffer frame size to a large value, such as 4096. Since this results
        in approximately 100ms worth of buffer, set the buffer size to a much lower
        value when playing WebAudio, which is much more sensitive to latency than video
        or audio elements.

        Introduce a new class, AudioSessionManager, as well as a helper class,
        AudioSessionManagerToken. Audio elements, video elements, and WebAudio destination
        nodes will create and retain a token, and release the token in their destructor.
        This allows the AudioSessionManager to track how many of what type of audio-
        generating objects are in existence.

        This requires implementing AudioSession for Mac platforms. Move the implementation
        for retrieving the hardware sample rate and setting the buffer duration into
        AudioSessionMac from AudioDestinationMac, to be shared with AudioSessionManagerMac.

        Change the AudioSession method preferredBufferLength() into preferredBufferSize(),
        as the callers really want to specify a buffer size, not a buffer duration. On iOS,
        where the available API requires a duration, perform the conversion from duration to
        size on behalf of the caller.

        However, since the original version of this patch caused media test
        failures on the Mac ML and Lion bots, only enable the buffer size
        change for OS X > ML.

        Issue is invoked when there is a visibility:hidden layer with a non-compositable
        background image (e.g. a radial gradient).
        The layer is treated as a no-contents layer because of its visibility, however
        updateDirectlyCompositedBackgroundImage() later mistakenly treats it as a layer
        with direct background-image compositing.

        The instance of GraphicsContext3D has already been destroyed but
        WebGLLayerWebKitThread is not aware of that. This is because compositor
        layer of the WebGL graphics context was referenced outside the context.
        So when destructing GraphicsContext3D the compositing layer was not

        Fix by setting m_webGLContext to 0 when destructing GrapthicsContext3D

        RenderTexts, which share style with their parent renderer.
        
        RenderText overrides styleWillChange() to do nothing, so we never

        Inserting an element before the fullscreened element could crash if it caused a containing inline to be split,
        since the splitting logic doesn't expect the fullscreened element to be wrapped in a RenderFullScreen. This patch changes
        inline splitting to be aware of RenderFullScreen.

        RenderObject increments and decrements a counter of slow repaint objects on
        FrameView when it sees style changes related to background-attachment:fixed.
        However, it omitted to decrement the count when a renderer with a fixed background
        was destroyed.
        
        This caused Flickr to never fall into fast scrolling mode, since it toggled
        display:none on an element with a fixed background during loading, then removed
        the fixed background.

        Have IDL interface names match their global constructor name on DOMWindow.idl

        prefixed constructors. This is mandated by Web IDL specification:

        As a consequence, we can now get rid of [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute
        for those interfaces and have their global constructors automatically generated
        by the bindings generator.

        No new tests, no behavior change for layout tests.

        Implement overlap-avoidance for in-band text track cues.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116540

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        In-band (or Generic) cues need special casing for certain features
        present in in-band tracks, like paint-on and roll-up modes. To avoid
        the problem of overlap avoidance forcing a caption meant to appear
        below a cue to appear above it when a larger font size is selected,
        impose an additional sort ordering for "generic cues". Instead of
        cues being ordered by the order they appear in the track, "generic
        cues" further sorted by their position within the video area, such
        that cues at the bottom of the video area appear first, and later
        cues are pushed up to avoid them, preserving the desired apparent
        ordering.

        Reviewed by Alexandru Chiculita.

        Add support for parsing image URI values for the shape-inside and shape-outside CSS properties.
        Extended the ExclusionShapeValue class to support tracking the property's StyleImage value.

        The ExclusionShapeValue::type enums were changed from all upper case to "Intercase" by order
        of the style bot.

        The existing CSS parsing tests were extended to check URI values.

        The drag source is an element, so use RefPtr<Element> instead of RefPtr<Node>.

        Also, the entire drag state is about dragging, so no need for the word "drag" in the
        name of its members. Also, it's a struct, so the members don't need m_ prefixes.

        the types and names of arguments accordingly. Also made this function handle a
        startElement of 0 so callers don't need to. Also updated for changes to DragState members.
        (WebCore::DragController::startDrag): Updated for changes to DragState members.
        Since dragSource can only be an element, was able to get rid of isElementNode checks.

        change of draggableNode to draggableElement. Also removed declarations of nonexistent

        * page/DragState.h: Rewrote practically this whole header. Added an include of Element
        instead of Node since that's what we use now. Removed includes that are redundant.
        There's no problem copying a DragState, so removed WTF_MAKE_NONCOPYABLE. There's no need
        to allocate a DragState on the heap, so removed WTF_MAKE_FAST_ALLOCATED. The event dispatch
        boolean is never set to a constant, so there's no need for a policy enum; it can just be
        a boolean. Removed the "m_" prefixes from the struct members, since this is a struct with
        public members and we don't use the prefix in those cases. Removed the word "drag" from the
        struct member names since this entire struct is about dragging and has drag in its name.

        Hoist several chunks of code at the top of RenderLayer::paintLayerContents() onto new functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116406

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        RenderLayer::paintLayerContents() was getting polluted with code related to filters,
        clipping and font subpixel quantization, and hard to follow.
        
        Move three hunks of code into new functions:
        setupFontSubpixelQuantization() now contains the code related to whether we disable
        font subpixel quantization on the context.
        setupClipPath() now contains code related to clipping to shapes and references.
        setupFilters() and applyFilters() contain code related to CSS filters.
        
        As part of this, the interaction with FilterEffectRendererHelper was simplified.
        It was convenient for setupFilters() to return a FilterEffectRendererHelper object
        if successful, so we use an OwnPtr<FilterEffectRendererHelper> now. In addition,
        the GraphicsContext swapping was moved from FilterEffectRendererHelper code into RenderLayer
        to make it easier to follow. FilterEffectRendererHelper no longer holds on to
        the old GraphicsContext.

        No behavior change.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        RenderStyle::diff() was prone to being changed incorrectly, since there was
        a poorly documented ordering requirement: style changes that cause layout
        have to be detected before those that cause only repainting.
        
        In addition, the existing code made it impossible to separately ask whether
        a given style change requires a repaint, if we've already detected that it
        requires a positioned-movement-only layout.
        
        Fix by factoring the code into member functions that check for each type
        of style change.

        Garbage on page background while http://canberraballoons.com.au is loading

        <rdar://problem/13930328>

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        This page loads a large JPEG image as the body background.
        ImageSource::frameHasAlphaAtIndex() always claims that JPEG images
        are opaque, but this isn't true if the frame is only partially loaded.
        However, this would cause FillLayer::hasOpaqueImage() to report that the
        background image is opaque, so we'd skip painting the background color.
        Unpainted content in an opaque layer results in garbage.
        
        Fix by having ImageSource::frameHasAlphaAtIndex() always return true
        for frames that are not complete. When the image load completes, we
        recompute metadata and correctly determine that the frame is opaque.

        Rationalize the font and padding behavior of cues and cue boxes; ::cue pseudo elements cannot have padding
        values applied via CSS (due to padding not being included in the whitelist of applicable CSS properties).
        Also, the font values were being applied to the box at one level and the cue at another, leading to incorrect
        layout in the snapToLines case. Padding has been removed from the cue, and the font settings are now applied
        to the box exclusively.

        Additionally, a few drive-by changes were made in TextTrackCue to the return values of displayTreeInternal() &
        element(), which previously returned a PassRefPtr<> instead of a plain pointer.

        Changes in text-only properties shouldn't cause repaints unless there is actually text.
        <http://webkit.org/b/116250>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Add a new StyleDifferenceRepaintIfText value to the repertoire of RenderStyle::diff().
        This result means that the renderer only needs to repaint if one of its immediate children contains text.

        This lets us avoid repainting the same pixels when hovering over constructs like:

            <style>
                a { text-decoration: none; }
                a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }

                <img src="cool-hat.jpg">
            </a>

        Since the change in text-decoration has no effect on the rendering of the <img> element,
        we'll now be smart enough to avoid repainting it.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        If we create a prefixed event to dispatch it (in the case we have only
        prefixed event listeners in client's code) then we need to make sure to
        keep it in sync with the original unprefixed event after it has been
        dispatched. While being dispatched the event can be modified by
        client's code and when propagated back to outer elements, attributes were
        not updated. This patch changes the old design of creating a separate event
        for the prefixed case and now change the type of the event (so the name) before
        dispatching it, keeping the attributes if changed and then rename it
        back to unprefixed when the dispatching is finished.

        files should return an error if the file changed after the URL was
        created. By indefinitely caching them in memory, we don't give the

        DocumentOrderedMap doesn't need to have two HashMaps
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116167

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Previously, we had two hash maps: m_map and m_duplicateCounts in DocumentOrderedMap to keep track
        of the first element and the number of duplicates for a given name. This patch simplifies this structure
        by having a single hash map that contains both the pointer and the number of duplicates.

        In addition, this patch fixes a regression introduced in r149652 that window and document name maps
        were not updated for some elements inside a SVG use element, and makes use of the newly added list of
        the matching elements in SelectorQuery.

        Fixed the bug by splitting updateId into two functions updateIdForTreeScope and updateIdForDocument.
        The former is called when this element is inserted into a new tree scope, and the latter is called when
        this element is inserted into a HTML document even if it had already been inside some tree scope.

        (WebCore::Element::removedFrom): This function didn't remove this element from tree scope's id maps if

        [BlackBerry] When HTTP auth fails, only purge credentials that match the failed credentials

        When there are multiple HTTP requests in flight with the same bad credentials (common with
        proxy auth if the user mistyped their password), the first 407 that's received will cause
        the credentials to be purged and the password dialog to open for new credentials. This means
        that all 407's received after this should only purge the credentials if they have not
        already been updated from the dialog; otherwise they will be wiping out credentials that
        haven't failed yet.

        AX: Use caching when requesting children object on iOS
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116112

        Reviewed by David Kilzer.

        Building up the children list in the AX hierarchy can be time consuming. On iOS, this
        is now much more noticeable (I believe due to the way tables calculate their AX ignored flag).

        We can speed everything up if we just cache the isIgnored() attribute while building up children.

        REGRESSION: united.com has overlapping elements and is broken by flex box changes.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115329
        <rdar://problem/13690610>
        
        The new flexbox spec says that flex-basis omitted in the flex shorthand defaults to
        0 when flex-grow/shrink are set. This has undesirable behavior when objects don't
        end up flexing at all, and it's something the spec is going to eventually address.
        
        For now, though, to fix the regression, I'm making a targeted "hack" to deliberately
        violate the spec, but to do so as minimally as possible. This hack detects if there
        is infinite available space on a line, and if so, it treats a flex-basis of 0 like
        auto.
        
        This means that when height is constrained and set by a container, flexing will do
        the right thing. Basically any time you end up actually flexing, the spec behavior
        should happen. If you're just laying out at intrinsic sizes, though, and no flexing
        is going to occur, we ignore a flex-basis of 0 and just use the child's normal size.
        
        Note that widths don't have to be patched because the preferred logical widths
        algorithm is broken right now and not checking flex-basis. If it did, we'd have seen
        the same bug in the width direction.
        
        This width issue is covered by https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116117

        When a portion of the render tree is being detached, anonymous blocks
        will be combined as their children are deleted. In this process, the
        anonymous block later in the tree is merged into the one preceeding it.
        It can happen that the later block contains floats that the previous
        block did not contain, and thus are not in the floating objects list for
        the new block. This can result in the new block containing floats that
        are not in it's floating objects list, but are in the floating objects
        lists of siblings and parents. This can cause problems when the float
        itself is deleted, since the deletion code assumes that if a float is not
        in it's containing block's floating objects list, it isn't in any
        floating objects list, causing dangling pointers in the floating objects
        lists of the siblings and parents. In order to preserve this condition
        (removing it has serious performance implications), we need to copy the
        floating objects from the old block to the new block.  The float's
        metrics will likely all be wrong, but since the new block is already
        marked for layout, this will get fixed before anything gets displayed.

        [GStreamer] cannot seek after video finished
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114044

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        Test: media/video-seek-after-end.html

        Reland without wrong assertion. If seek is called after didEnd the pipeline
        state will not be in GST_STATE_NULL yet but it is not a problem because we handle that.

        Rework the seeking logic to be able to seek after reseting the pipeline.
        In addition to solve the actual problem this patch supposed to make seeking
        more robust and correct.
        The previous implementation tried to hide the complexity of asynchronous operations
        on the pipeline. It did not handle the GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE message from the bus
        but instead reported the seek as finished when it saw an asynchronous pending state
        (GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC) which could happen way before the seek is really done.
        Now we pay attention to the GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE message to track the status of seeks.
        Seeks are not the only operations executed asynchronously, changing the pipeling state is
        similar. It means a seek can overlap with onother ongoing asynchronous operation.
        This change address this by introducing an invariant for seeks, which is that we only request
        a seek if there are no other ongoing asynchronous operations and the pipeline state is either
        paused or playing (which is recommended anyway according to GStreamer's documentation).
        This way we can be sure that the time when we get the next GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE message the
        seek has been completed.

        * platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.cpp:
        (WebCore::toGstClockTime): Factored time conversation into a helper.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer):

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::playbackPosition): The position might not be available
        if the pipeline still has a pending state. As a workaround, if we are right after a seek we can
        use the seek time. Avoiding this situation would be possible by not allowing any asynchronous
        operation to overlap. I believe it would add a lot more complexity so I decided to rather introduce
        this workaround. Otherwise those overlapping operations are handled fine by GStreamer.

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::prepareToPlay): Do not reset internal state variables.
        This function called when there is an intent to restart playback but it does not actually restart it.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::currentTime): Just removed a staling newline.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::seek): Take a look to the pipeline state and act upon that.
        If there is an ongoing asynchronous operation make the seek pending, otherwise do it now.
        Now we handle overlapping seeks as well because I saw that it can happen in some tests.
        Added an early return for live streams as it doesn't makes sense to try seeking in them.

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::cacheDuration): Do not reset the m_mediaDurationKnown if the pipeline
        has an asynchronous pending state because it would fail. It does actually happen when we get a duration message
        after restarting the pipeline and it would result in restarting playback from the start. It seems to be a bug
        in GStreamer that it sends the duration message too early. Also sanitized this function by merging redundant branches.

        Currently GraphicsLayerCA uses pageScaleFactor in requiresTiledLayer() and

        them.
        It is because:
        1. requiresTiledLayer() uses the scale to compute an actual layer size in the device
        pixel unit.
        2. computePixelAlignment() uses the scale to compute an aligned layer position
        in the device pixel unit.

        No new tests. We can not test about requiresTiledLayer() because it depends on

        In some accelerated rendering cases, calling toDataURL on

        [CSS Regions][CSS Exclusions] Shape-inside on regions should respect region borders and paddings
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115456

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        I refactored the computation logic of shape-inside on regions by removing access to RenderFlowThread from ExclusionShapeInfo's logicalTopOffset
        function, this means all the logic is now existing in RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp. By modifying the logicalTopOffset it turned out that the borders
        and padding hadn't worked correctly, since borders and paddings were counted twice in the shape-inside's computation. This patch adds the necessary
        modifications to let it respect the borders and padding in the correct way. I created 2 new helper functions to prevent increasing the code size of
        the layoutRunsAndFloatsInRange function.

        I introduced 7 new tests to test for testing the correct behavior.

        [GStreamer] cannot seek after video finished
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114044

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        Test: media/video-seek-after-end.html

        Rework the seeking logic to be able to seek after reseting the pipeline.
        In addition to solve the actual problem this patch supposed to make seeking
        more robust and correct.
        The previous implementation tried to hide the complexity of asynchronous operations
        on the pipeline. It did not handle the GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE message from the bus
        but instead reported the seek as finished when it saw an asynchronous pending state
        (GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC) which could happen way before the seek is really done.
        Now we pay attention to the GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE message to track the status of seeks.
        Seeks are not the only operations executed asynchronously, changing the pipeling state is
        similar. It means a seek can overlap with onother ongoing asynchronous operation.
        This change address this by introducing an invariant for seeks, which is that we only request
        a seek if there are no other ongoing asynchronous operations and the pipeline state is either
        paused or playing (which is recommended anyway according to GStreamer's documentation).
        This way we can be sure that the time when we get the next GST_MESSAGE_ASYNC_DONE message the
        seek has been completed.

        * platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.cpp:
        (WebCore::toGstClockTime): Factored time conversation into a helper.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer):

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::playbackPosition): The position might not be available
        if the pipeline still has a pending state. As a workaround, if we are right after a seek we can
        use the seek time. Avoiding this situation would be possible by not allowing any asynchronous
        operation to overlap. I believe it would add a lot more complexity so I decided to rather introduce
        this workaround. Otherwise those overlapping operations are handled fine by GStreamer.

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::prepareToPlay): Do not reset internal state variables.
        This function called when there is an intent to restart playback but it does not actually restart it.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::currentTime): Just removed a staling newline.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::seek): Take a look to the pipeline state and act upon that.
        If there is an ongoing asynchronous operation make the seek pending, otherwise do it now.
        Now we handle overlapping seeks as well because I saw that it can happen in some tests.
        Added an early return for live streams as it doesn't makes sense to try seeking in them.

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::cacheDuration): Do not reset the m_mediaDurationKnown if the pipeline
        has an asynchronous pending state because it would fail. It does actually happen when we get a duration message
        after restarting the pipeline and it would result in restarting playback from the start. It seems to be a bug
        in GStreamer that it sends the duration message too early. Also sanitized this function by merging redundant branches.

        For WebKit1, it just calls the NSProcessInfo methods to keep behavior the same.
        For WebKit2, the new methods plumb through the information to the UI process.

        Also updated the DOMWindow logic to think in terms of per-DOMWindow sudden termination counters
        instead of a process-global one, since that gets confusing in a WK2 world.
        When a DOMWindow transitions between having/not having unload/beforeunload event listeners,
        we send a notification to the Chrome.

        Devirtualize some things on Document.

        From Blink r149967 by <esprehn@chromium.org>
        <http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=revision&revision=149967>

        Several methods on Document are virtual but don't override a super class method
        and don't need to be virtual. This patch devirtualizes:

            - createElementNS()
            - finishedParsing()
            - suspendScriptedAnimationControllerCallbacks()
            - resumeScriptedAnimationControllerCallbacks()

        It also removes the suspend and resume callbacks from ScriptExecutionContext
        since they didn't need to be there.

        REGRESSION: Fixed background on ColterReed.com scrolls
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115951

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.
        
        The logic for painting the fixed root background into its own layer was
        broken when the document element's layer was composited. This could be caused
        by a negative z-index child of the body, or by an explicit compositing-causing
        style on the <html>.
        
        There were two issues. First, when painting the layer for the fixed root
        background, we would simply short-circuit the fixed background paint in
        RenderLayer::paintLayer(), when checking for a composited layer. We have
        to continue to paint through the composited <html> layer to get the root
        background in this case.
        
        Secondly, RenderLayerBacking::paintIntoLayer() would only set the PaintLayerPaintingSkipRootBackground
        flag if this RenderLayerBacking had a m_backgroundLayer. However, when the <html> is
        composited, we need to skip painting the root layer for both the RenderView's backing,
        and for the <html>'s backing. Checking whether there is *any* layer that paints
        the fixed root background (i.e. checking compositor()->fixedRootBackgroundLayer())
        is a simple way to fix this test.

        RenderLayer::backgroundIsKnownToBeOpaqueInRect() used hasVisibleContent()
        to check whether the layer's content was hidden via the visibility property.
        However, this assumed that a passing hasVisibleContent() check meant that the
        entire area was covered by the renderers and layers checked layer.
        
        This is not always true. It's possible to have a visibility:hidden layer
        with a non-covering visbility:visible child, or even a single RenderText
        child that happens to have visibility:visible style. In these situations,
        hasVisibleContent() returns true but the entire area is not painted.
        
        So we have to fall back to on a more conservative check using the
        visibility style, which will give is a reliable answer for the current layer.

        RenderLayer::backgroundIsKnownToBeOpaqueInRect() would incorrectly return true

        where some child layer obscured the rect, even though clipping hid part

        So bail from RenderLayer::backgroundIsKnownToBeOpaqueInRect() if we have

        Caching of generated images in CSS should be smarter.
        <http://webkit.org/b/115902>

        Add an IntSize => GeneratorGeneratedImage cache at the CSSImageGeneratorValue level.

        CSSGradientValue is currently the only CSSImageGeneratorValue subclass that makes use of the cache.
        Generated images are kept for 3 seconds after last use.

        The main problem with the previous approach was that background renderers (e.g <body>, <tr>, etc)
        would be passed to multiple CSSImageGeneratorValue::getImage() calls with different sizes requested
        for each of the descendent renderers that inherit their background from the same parent.
        The cache wasn't smart enough for this, it just thought the background renderer was changing size
        a lot, and would regenerate the image over and over.

        We already had caching of intermediate image buffers for GeneratorGeneratedImage::drawPattern().
        This removes the eviction timer from that cache so that the intermediate images can live a bit longer.

        REGRESSION (r149652): Videos do not play on cnn.com, just black box
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115887

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The bug was caused by window and document named item maps counting the same element twice
        when it has the same id and name attribute values. Fixed the bug by avoiding to add or remove
        an element per id and name attribute updates when it had already been added or removed by
        name and id attribute updates respectively.

        We do this by checking whether the other attribute affects the element's precense in window
        and document named item maps and avoiding to add or remove the attribute when they do and
        the other attribute is present in updateId and updateName.

        Consider a scenario when an object element has id "foo", and name attribute is about to be also
        set to "foo". If the id attribute doesn't affect element's presense in window or document
        named item maps, we're done. If it does, then the maps already have this element so we don't
        want to add it again. Conversely, if the element already has id and name attributes set to
        "foo", and we're moving the id attribute, then we want to remove the element from the maps only
        if the id doesn't affect the presence of the element in the maps.

        Unfortuntely, this logic doesn't work when we're inserting or removing an element on its entirely
        because updateId and updateName are called when both id and name attributes are present so skip
        this step (AlwaysUpdateHTMLDocumentNamedItemMaps) for the id attribute to break the symmetry.

        Test: fast/dom/HTMLDocument/image-with-same-id-and-name.html

        * dom/Element.cpp:
        (WebCore::Element::insertedInto): Call updateId and updateName with

        (WebCore::Element::removedFrom): Ditto.
        (WebCore::Element::updateName): Don't add or remove this element if the id attribute has already
        done so except when we're inserting, removing, or cloning an element.
        (WebCore::Element::updateId): Ditto for the name attribute.
        (WebCore::Element::cloneAttributesFromElement): Added a comment and assert that we never call this
        function when this element is in the document. We can't update window and documemt named item
        maps here because image element's id attribute value, for example, is present in the document's
        named item map if it has a name attribute. Since this function calls updateId and updateName
        before updating attributes, this check is going to fail in DocumentNameCollection's
        nodeMatchesIfIdAttributeMatch and bad things will happen.

        Remove [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute from the following Web IDL
        interfaces: SecurityPolicy, History, Location, Navigator, Performance,
        PerformanceEntry, PerformanceMark, PerformanceMeasure, PerformanceNavigation,
        PerformanceResourceTiming, PerformanceTiming and Screen.

        These interfaces should not have the [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute
        according to their respective specifications:

        (WebCore::RenderQuote::RenderQuote): Updated for m_isAttached name change.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::~RenderQuote): Updated for name change, and also split
        assertion with && in it into two separate assertions.
        (WebCore::checkNumberOfDistinctQuoteCharacters): Added. Helper function that is used
        to check that the number of distinct quote characters is small enough to fit into
        our fixed size array below.
        (WebCore::quotesForLanguage): Replaces the old quotesDataLanguageMap function.
        Returns a pointer to a struct that contains the four quote characters. This new
        function doesn't have the massive amount of code that the old one did. We use the
        standard library bsearch function to do a binary search.
        (WebCore::stringForQuoteCharacter): Added. This returns a string for a given quote
        character; one string for any given character.
        (WebCore::quotationMarkString): Added. Returns the string for the quotation mark.
        (WebCore::apostropheStringImpl): Added. Returns the string for the apostrophe.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::originalText): Rewrote this to include all the logic that
        used to be in the quotesData function.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::attachQuote): Tweak assertions as above. Removed unneeded
        special case for the first quote in a RenderView; sharing the code is better and
        there is no significant performance difference. Also use m_isAttached directly
        when looking at predecessores so there is no need for an isAttached function.

        (WebCore::RenderQuote::updateDepth): Ditto.

        * rendering/RenderQuote.h: Removed unneeded includes. Marked the class FINAL since
        we call the originalText function in the class and we don't want to do a virtual
        function dispatch for that. Removed uneeded const from an argument. Removed a
        stray semicolon. Removed the quotesData and isAttached functions, since they are no

        plugins referenced by iFrames will be treated as an HTMLDocument,

        Add support for [NoInterfaceObject] Web IDL extended attribute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115714

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        *Constructor attributes on the global DOMWindow object are now automatically
        generated for each non-callback interface that is not declared with the
        [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute. It is thus no longer needed for
        developers to manually add *Constructor attributes for their new interfaces
        unless they wish to register an "extra" constructor for their interface.

        This patch does not modify at all the behavior on JS side. To achieve this,
        [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute is added to interfaces that should
        not have it according to specification (e.g. History, Location, ...).
        This can be improved later as the behavior should not change with this
        patch.

        No new tests, no behavior change.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115776

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        I changed depth to more closely match what is in the CSS3 specification.
        There may be a more optimal way to make it work, but this seems the most straightforward.

        * rendering/RenderQuote.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::RenderQuote): Initialize m_depth to -1 because that depth
        is consistent with the empty string that is the initial value of the text. The
        real depth will be calculated when the node is attached.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::originalText): Removed the "depth - 1" logic that
        used to be done for close quotes. Instead, the updateDepth function now correctly
        subtracts one for the close quote itself, not just afterward. Also added an early
        exit when the depth is negative; these changes together fix the bug.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::attachQuote): Added a call to updateDepth even for the render
        quote head, we now need that to set the depth either to 0 or to -1.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::detachQuote): Removed code to set m_depth to 0;  if we are not
        resetting the text then m_depth should be left matching the text, otherwise updateDepth
        might not do its job correctly if the quote is later re-attached. What matters is that
        m_depth and the text are in sync.
        (WebCore::RenderQuote::updateDepth): Changed updating logic in two ways. First,
        compute the depth in a local variable rather than computing it in a data member
        after first saving off the old value of the data member. That's clearer style.
        Second, add the code to change negative depths to zero when propagating to the
        next quote in the chain, which matches how the standard is written, and decrement
        the depth of the close quote itself, not the quote after the close quote.

        Revision 148840 fixed on-disk buffering being done when preload is set to none,
        but memory buffering is still being done. That is because setting the state to
        paused causes GStreamer to start loading the media, to gather information. Only
        doing that when committing the load avoids that while maintaining the tested
        behaviour unchanged.

        The de-virtualization possibilities were noted whilst "FINALizing" the Node
        hierarchy. If a method is successfully marked FINAL but then fails when marked
        OVERRIDE as well, the method by definition does not need to be virtual.

        Curl adds the header 'Expect: 100-Continue' when sending a POST request.
        When we receive the header 'HTTP/1.1 100 Continue', we should not call
        ResourceHandleClient::didReceiveResponse(), as this will cancel the request,
        because the MIME type is empty in this case, causing the POST request to fail.

        This fix here is just to rollout the change that caused this regression, which is 
        http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/147395 . That change was not intended to cause any 
        behavioral differences. The change made it so RenderObject::offsetParent() returned 
        an Element* instead of a RenderBoxModelObject*. However, can muddle things when the 
        object we are returning is a continuation. Multiple RenderObjects have the same 
        Element in a continuation, so this new code can lead to a crash in 
        adjustedPositionRelativeToOffsetParent() when we expect to walk the RenderObject 
        chain and find the offsetParent in the Element’s parent chain. But we might crash in 
        some complicated continuation scenarios because we lost this disambiguation of which 
        RenderObject to start with.

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        Bug #86410 focuses on having composited/accelerated video using the
        TextureMapper. But the video is not rendered fast by using the
        repaint() method. In the case of the TextureMapper it is required to
        call a content display as fast as possible.

        This patch adds the class TextureMapperPlatformLayer::Client with the
        method setLayerNeedsDisplay(). The GraphicsLayerTextureMapper
        implements this new class and the new method calls
        setContentsNeedsDisplay(), causing a faster content display when

        Improve the performance of RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115543.

        Optimize deprecated flexible box layout to be much faster. This patch implements
        the following optimizations in the deprecated flexible box:
        
        (1) Defer repainting of children until they have been placed into their final
        positions. This is done by collecting all of the old frame rects into a Vector
        and then doing a walk after layout is finished to repaint any of the children if
        they moved from that position. This code matches the new RenderFlexibleBox's system
        for repainting moved children.
        
        (2) Implement support for layout deltas. We keep a Vector of layout deltas for each
        child as we shift them around, and every time we lay a child out again, we apply that
        child's current layout delta to avoid repainting at the new position. RenderFlexibleBox
        does not have support for layout deltas yet, so we'll need to implement this in the
        new flexbox code as well.
        
        (3) Optimize flexible objects to avoid laying them out unflexed. When laying out
        horizontal and vertical boxes now, we lay out the inflexible items first. We then
        check to see if the inflexible extent of all those children has changed.
        
        If this extent didn't change, and the flexible items either don't need layout or there
        is only one flexing item, then we avoid laying out the item in an unflexed state
        and simply lay out one time with the flex applied instead. The new RenderFlexibleBox
        does not have these optimizations and would benefit from them in the block-direction box
        case (it uses preferred logical widths in the inline-direction box case, and so avoided
        layouts in that direction already).

        * rendering/RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::appendChildFrameRects):
        Cache all of the old child frame rects so that we can compare them with the final
        positions for repaintDuringLayoutIfMoved. This collection is identical to what the
        new flexbox code does.
        
        (WebCore::appendChildLayoutDeltas):
        Build up a vector that tracks layout deltas. We apply these layout deltas every
        time we lay out a child so that any repainting done during layout ignores our shifted
        position and just keeps using the old position. The new flexbox does not have this
        code yet.

        (WebCore::repaintChildrenDuringLayoutIfMoved):
        After final placement of children, we do a single pass over all of the children and

        Don't clear flex overrides when gathering flex information. Add additional information

        Both methods are patched to aggregate layout deltas as children move around during
        the multiple passes. In addition we now optimize layout in a couple of cases, such
        as when the inflexible space stays the same (thus giving a flexible object the
        same amount of available space, avoiding a need to lay out unflexed first).

        Animations and Transitions should not start when globally suspended
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114915

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        When the Document's AnimationController was suspended, we still
        started new transitions and animations. Change this so that
        animations enter a paused-but-new state, where they are frozen
        until the AnimationController resumes. At that time, it is as
        if they had just appeared: any delay counts down before
        the animation starts.

        For transitions, the change in value must still happen, but
        it does so immediately. No transitionend event should be fired.
        This produces a slightly confusing behaviour, because any
        in-progress transitions are suspended, but any new style changes
        happen instantly. This might sound contradictory, but in general
        suspending the document is a rare (and dangerous) thing to do.

        Previously, the Document would call resumeAnimations as it loaded,
        effectively starting all the animations. This meant if you suspended
        animations before loading a document, it was ignored as soon as the
        load finished. Now there is a separate method startAnimationsIfNotSuspended
        which checks to see if the document is suspended as it loads.

        In order to handle this case, I added a new state to the Animation
        machinery: AnimationStatePausedNew. This is an animation that was created
        in the suspended state.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The patch moves pixelSnappedLayoutOverflowRect and maxLayoutOverflow out
        of RenderBox somewhere logically closer to their usage place.

        pixelSnappedLayoutOverflowRect - moved to RenderView because it's called only
        for RenderView at this moment.
        There are other places when the overflow rect is pixel snapped but only after
        the rect is adjusted for writing modes or inflated.

        maxLayoutOverflow - moved to RenderTreeAsText.cpp as a static function because
        it's used only there.

        For some fonts that don't have width variants, we fail to combine glyphs

        MIME types are defined to be case-insensitive, but many places in WebCore
        only compare them against lower-case strings. Most entry points for MIME
        types lower-case them, but mimeTypeFromDataURL doesn't, causing, for example,
        data:image/png;... to work, but data:iMaGe/PNG;... to fail.

        [Texmap] Use fewer intermediate surfaces when compositing filters
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115224

        Reviewed by Allan Sandfeld Jensen.

        Until now, when rendering CSS filters, the filters were applied to the texture
        and then the resulting texture would be composited to the target surface with
        its transform/opacity.
        This requires at least two intermediate surface passes for every filtered layer.

        This patch makes it so that the last filter pass is applied together with the 
        resulting surface's opacity and transform, during composition.

        Tested by css3/filters tests, whichn now scroll/zoom a lot faster.

        CSSParser::parseFontFamily should allow the keyword "default" as part of a font name
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107231

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Make sure that using the keyword "default" as font family doesn't
        invalidate the whole declaration. It is also OK to use a font that
        has "default" as part of a composite name (i.e. "default foo").
        This matches the behavior of Firefox and IE.

        Enable performance.now() as a minimal subset of Web Timing API. 
        It returns DOMHighResTimeStamp, a monotonically increasing value representing the 
        number of milliseconds from the start of the navigation of the current document.
        JS libraries use this API to check against the requestAnimationFrame() timestamp.

        Replace "Optional" extended attribute by proper Web IDL "optional" keyword
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115380

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        Replace [Optional] with standard WebIDL optional type prefix:
        http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#dfn-optional-argument

        The default behavior now matches WebIDL: [Optional] => optional

        Two cases where WebKit has extended bindings behavior still
        require a non-standard IDL attribute:
        [Optional=DefaultIsNullString] => [Default=NullString] optional
        [Optional=DefaultIsUndefined] => [Default=Undefined] optional

        Based on corresponding Blink patch from Joshua Bell for compatibility.

        No new tests, no behavior change.

        SVGElement destructor can use invalid iterator
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115361

        Reviewed by Philip Rogers.

        When an SVGElement object has rare data, its destructor gets a
        hash map iterator for the rare data, uses it to clear resources,
        then uses the iterator to delete the rare data. However, the resource
        cleanup can delete other SVG elements, thus modifying the hash map
        from which the iterator came and hence invalidating the iterator
        itself.

        The fix is to re-get the iterator before deleting the rare data.

        Make the "resize" event synchronous and dispatch it before doing any automatic
        resize-induced layout. This avoids unnecessary work in cases where an event handler
        does something that dirties style.

        It also avoids a kind of JS-side FOUC that happens if we drop out to the runloop
        and paint before the resize event handler runs; for example, when viewing a popup
        on <http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/> and resizing the window, the dark
        overlay sometimes resizes out of sync with the web view, since a paint may happen
        between automatic layout and the resize event.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Disable the automatic pixel doubling in canvas backing stores on high
        dpi devices. This will potentially make canvases look worse of high dpi
        displays, but only if they were ignoring devicePixelRatio. Since the
        majority of high dpi displays *do not* auto-double (including mobile
        devices and other desktop browsers), this provides consistency and less

        This is more natural, since the callers work exclusively in LayoutUnits.

        We now call GetFunctionLength() instead of GenerateFunctionParametersCheck()
        whenever we care only interested in the function length and not the actual

        GenerateFunctionParametersCheck() does a lot more processing than we need in

        [CSS Regions] Hit testing is broken for absolutely positioned regions that have overflow: hidden
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113874

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Test: fast/regions/hit-test-abspos-overflow-region.html

        When a region is an out-of-flow positioned object with an overflow clip, we need
        to make sure that hit testing works also for cases other than foreground (content)
        hit testing. This patch moves the previous hit testing code, that delegated foreground
        hit testing to the region's flow thread hit testing, into the hitTestContent method,

        Copy and paste can strip !important CSS rules due to a bug in mergeStyleFromRules
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115217

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The bug was caused by mergeStyleFromRules overriding "important" style rules with "unimportant" inline styles.
        Fixed the bug by using addParsedProperty, which respects !important, in MutableStylePropertySet's
        mergeAndOverrideOnConflict, which was only used in editing code. Now that we've fixed this function, we can use
        it in ViewportStyleResolver::addViewportRule as well.

        From Blink r148628 by <cevans@chromium.org>:

        FINAL is a macro in wtf/Compiler.h that does the correct thing if the compiler does not support "final")
        The approach used is as simple as possible whilst being thorough.
        So, leaf classes have FINAL applied to the whole class whereas intermediary classes have FINAL applied to relevant methods.

        FINAL allows a compiler to devirtualize call sites and turn them into direct calls. As you might expect, this is perf positive:
        (clang on Linux):
        - line_layout.html goes from 120 runs/s -> 123 runs/2, +2.5%
        - html5-full-render.html goes from 3176ms -> 3162ms, +0.4%

        I have confidence that the former result is statistically significant (as the numbers are very very stable) but not the latter.

        EventSource: Synchronous loader callback not handled properly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115104

        When attempting a cross-origin request towards a non-HTTP URL, an early verification
        of the protocol scheme will cause didFailAccessControlCheck to be called synchronously
        before the loader has even finished being created. This special case was not handled
        properly, since we tried to cancel a non-existing loader, which resulted in a crash.
        In addition to checking whether a request is in flight before trying to cancel it,
        this change also schedules the initial creation of the loader to happen asynchronously
        when an EventSource is constructed, so that a script can register for the error event
        before it is dispatched (as a result of passing a non-HTTP URL to the constructor).

        Garbage pixels are caused by GraphicsLayerCA setting a layer to be opaque,

        toggled to be visibility:hidden on scrolling, but RenderLayer::backgroundIsKnownToBeOpaqueInRect()
        failed to consider that as something that can cause backgrounds not to be opaque.
        
        For the bug to happen, some subtle interactions with r142012 come into play

        With http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/119834 we started calling 
        ScrollbarPainterController's contentAreaScrolled/contentAreaScrolledInDirection

        crashes that we saw whenever this was called during a layout. However, that delay, 
        combined with the particulars of contentAreaScrolledInDirection cause this bug 
        where sometimes the scrollbars in an iframe will fade out very noticeably when 
        scrolling in a circle.

        This change makes it so we will only use the zero-delay timer if the 
        ScrollableArea is not currently handling a wheel event. If it IS handling a wheel 
        event, then we will send the notifications to AppKit right away. I confirmed that

        <http://webkit.org/b/115103>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Switch to using 'unsigned' for attribute indices. This gives consistent behavior
        on 32/64-bit, and the underlying storage is already limited by Vector's 32-bit capacity.

        Added an ElementData::attributeNotFound constant (-1) since we can't use WTF::notFound.

        Setting an inline style property to "" shouldn't cause style recalc unless the property was present.
        <http://webkit.org/b/115122>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        StylePropertySet::setProperty() handles empty strings by removing the property entirely.
        If there was no property to remove, it shouldn't claim that it changed something, as that
        will cause the CSSOM wrapper to mark the element for style recalc.

        A common idiom that triggers this is excessive use of { element.style.display = ''; }

        Moving word boundaries backwards fails when there is a text node starting with an apostrophe
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115070

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        The bug was caused by previousBoundary erroneously assuming that we don't need any more context if a word
        boundary is found at the beginning of a string. For example, when "I'll" is split into two text nodes,
        "I" and "'ll", there is a word boundary between "'" and "ll" in "'ll" so we need to examine the whole "I'll".

        Fixed the bug by obtaining more context when the character starts exactly at offset 1 in a text node to
        work around this bug. In the long term, we probably need to provide Foundation of the entire context since in
        languages like Hebrew and some of European languages, there could be many accents and combining characters
        between split into multiple text nodes as one variant is seen in the newly added test case.

        We want iOS to speak the landmark type.
        I've moved the landmark role description to the base Mac class and exposed
        these localized strings to iOS (the ones used to return landmark descriptions).

        I've also updated the accessibilityLabel to account for landmark type, but also
        handle multiple label sources more gracefully by appending commas, which changed a few
        tests in minor ways.
