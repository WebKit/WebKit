        AX: [ATK] Events missing and state incorrect for aria-activedescendant
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178523

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        When the aria-activedescendant of an element changes, emit object:state-changed:focused.
        When a focused element has a valid active descendant, do not expose the focused state on
        the element, but rather on the active descendant. Also expose the focusable state on the
        active descendant.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Once we find the first space, which has the COMMON script, we split the run, and the next ones keep using
        COMMON instead of ARABIC because we don't update the current script on every loop iteration. This patch
        simplifies the script handling by moving the code back to the loop and always breaking in case of different
        scripts, correctly handling INHERITED and COMMON cases and updating the current script when needed.

        RenderTable::forceSectionsRecalc() marks the RenderTable dirty and schedules a layout.
        Every time AccessibilityTable asks for the table element (including during construction),
        we end up triggering a layout. This call was added (r191357) to ensure RenderTable's m_firstBody is always
        up-to-date (in case of anonymous wrapper table renderer). Instead of relying on the m_firstBody,
        let's just use the first child to find the table element. The first child always points to a valid
        renderer (or nullptr), while m_firstBody is the result of section computation.

        [Cairo] Remove the cairo_glyph_t complexity from GlyphBuffer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177598

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Remove the decade-old use of cairo_glyph_t as the underlying type for
        Glyph. The former spans 24 bytes in size, while the latte is just 2
        bytes. The x and y coordinate attributes of cairo_glyph_t were only
        used in FontCascade::drawGlyphs() implementation, where they were
        overridden even if the same GlyphBuffer object was used here repeatedly.

        FontCascade::drawGlyphs() now creates a new Vector<cairo_glyph_t> object
        and fills it only with the glyph index and coordinates data for glyphs
        that will actually be drawn. This will likely in the future be leveraged
        to pack the necessary data and perform the drawing operations in
        parallelized tasks. GlyphBuffer usages that before required USE(CAIRO)
        special-casing can now be simplified.

        This also removes the need for <cairo.h> header inclusion in the
        GlyphBuffer.h header. This further removes Cairo header inclusion in
        roughly 600 build targets.

        [Cairo] Drop cairo_matrix_t conversion operators for AffineTransform, TransformationMatrix
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177539

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Remove the cairo_matrix_t conversion operators from the AffineTransform
        and TransformationMatrix classes. These are rarely used, but enforce
        including the cairo.h header in both headers, which leads to the Cairo
        headers being included in around 800 build targets.

        Instead, the toCairoMatrix() function is added to CairoUtilities.h that
        creates a cairo_matrix_t object for the given AffineTransform. No
        toCairoMatrix() is needed for TransformationMatrix since objects of
        that type aren't converted to cairo_matrix_t anywhere in the codebase.

        This patch excludes unnecessary Cairo headers from about 550 build
        targets (with those headers being included in the other affected 250
        targets by some other header inclusion chain). CairoUtilities.h header
        is now included where necessary to make toCairoMatrix() available, and
        duplicated cairo.h inclusions are removed.

        No new tests -- no change in behavior.

        [css-grid] fit-content() tracks shouldn't stretch
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177300

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        The spec is pretty clear regarding this
        (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#algo-stretch):
          "This step sizes expands tracks that have an auto max track sizing
           function by dividing any remaining positive, definite free space
           equally amongst them."

        The fit-content() tracks don't have an auto max track sizing function,
        so they shouldn't be considered in this step of the algorithm.

        The patch modifies GridTrackSizingAlgorithm::initializeTrackSizes()
        so it doesn't consider fit-content() tracks as auto sized ones
        (which are the ones later stretched in the last step of the algorithm).

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177406

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Because we do not want to block the main thread waiting for the image decoding
        thread to terminate, we let the decoding thread finish its work even it will
        be thrown away. If a new decoding thread is created and the SynchronizedFixedQueue
        is reopened, the terminating decoding thread might have the chance to process
        a new frame request. After it finishes decoding it, it realize that it is
        terminating so it will drop the decoded frame to the floor. So the new request
        was not processed by the new thread and because it was processed by the
        terminating thread, nothing will be reported to the BitmapImage object and
        the renderer will not be repainted.

        The fix is to create a new SynchronizedFixedQueue every time a decoding 
        thread is created. This will guarantee that the terminating thread won't
        have access to the new frame request and will shut down after being notified
        by the old SynchronizedFixedQueue that it has been closed.

        REGRESSION(r191731): SVGPatternElement can only reference another SVGPatternElement in the same SVG document

        The xlink:href attribute of the SVG filter, gradient and pattern elements
        must reference another element within the current SVG of the same type.

        In r191731, the code of SVGPatternElement::collectPatternAttributes() was
        removed and replaced by RenderSVGResourcePattern::collectPatternAttributes()
        to avoid cyclic reference in the pattern element. The problem is the old
        code used to check whether the referenced element is<SVGPatternElement>
        before casting it. This code was not copied to the new function. So we
        now allow the SVGPatternElement to reference any SVG resource element.

        To fix this issue, we need to prevent SVGResources from chaining an incorrect
        type of element to the SVG filter, gradient and pattern elements.

        We also need to use the SVGResources for getting the referenced element
        when collecting the attributes for the gradient elements. SVGResources solves
        the cyclic referencing issue so there is no need to repeat the same code
        in many places. Also, from now on the SVGResources will have valid linked
        resource only. So casting the referenced element should always be valid.

        http://trac.webkit.org/r215613 introduced an optimization to bail out of repainting borders if the invalidated
        rect to paint is fully contained within the inner rounded rect of the border. However, due to issues with
        coordinate and intersection math in RoundedRect::contains() and ellipseContainsPoint(), this causes
        RenderBoxModelObject::paintBorder to return early even in circumstances where the border requires a repaint.
        This patch fixes the contains() helper in RoundedRect and adds a new API test suite for RoundedRect that covers

        We fix this by adding the absolute values instead, so the check becomes: |x| + |y| <= R.

        for the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right corners, respectively.

        Additionally, the checks for the bottom left and bottom right to determine whether the rect corner should be
        checked for intersection against the ellipse's corner are incorrect. In the bottom left corner, the check for
        `otherRect.maxX() >= center.x()` should instead be `otherRect.x() <= center.x()`, and the check for

        Currently, TextFieldInputType::forwardEvent synchronously triggers style recomputation, for the purpose of
        scrolling to the origin upon handling a blur event, and also for updating caps lock state after a blur or focus.
        In synchronously triggering style recomputation, we may end up running arbitrary JavaScript, which may change
        the HTMLInputElement's type and cause the current TextFieldInputType to be destroyed.

        To mitigate this, we only update caps lock state when forwarding a focus or blur event to the InputType, and
        instead scroll blurred text fields to the origin later, in HTMLInputElement::didBlur (invoked from
        Document::setFocusedElement after blur and focusout events have fired). Instead of having the InputType update
        style, lift the call to Document::updateStyleIfNeeded up into HTMLInputElement so that we gracefully handle the
        case where the page destroys and sets a new InputType within the scope of this style update.

        Only a few of them are correctly rendered and some others are wrong. We only render correctly the ones that
        don't have an underscore in their name (or that start with a number like 3d_rotation). In the cases where the
        name before the underscore is also an icon, we render that icon instead, that's why some of them are wrong. This
        is happening because the underscore is causing the HarfbuffShaper to split the text in 3 runs, one for the word
        before the underscore, another one for the underscore and another for the word after the underscore. So, we
        end up trying to shape the 3 runs independently and we fail when the icon doesn't exist, or when it exists but
        it's not the one we are looking for. The cause of this is that the underscore has a different script (Common)
        than the rest of characters (Latin) which is a condition in HarfbuffShaper to create a different run. The
        unicode spec says that characters with Common script should be handled differently, but we are just ignoring
        it. The spec proposes to use an heuristic based on simply inheriting the script of the previous character, which
        should work in most of the cases. We could take a more conservative approach and do that only if both characters
        are ASCII. We should also consider handling other cases mentioned by the spec like brackets and quotation marks,
        but that belongs to a different bug/commit.

        Submitting a form can cause HTMLFormElement's associated elements vector to be mutated during iteration
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176368
        <rdar://problem/34254998>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        In the process of iterating over form.associatedElements() during form submission in FormSubmission::create, the
        page may cause us to clobber the vector of FormAssociatedElements* we're currently iterating over by inserting
        new form controls beneath the form element we're in the process of submitting. This happens because
        FormSubmission::create calls HTMLTextAreaElement::appendFormData, which requires layout to be up to date, which
        in turn makes us updateLayout() and set focus, which fires a `change` event, upon which the page's JavaScript
        inserts additonal DOM nodes into the form, modifying the vector of associated elements.

        To mitigate this, instead of iterating over HTMLFormElement::associatedElements(), which returns a reference to
        the HTMLFormElement's actual m_associatedElements vector, we iterate over a new vector of
        Ref<FormAssociatedElement>s created from m_associatedElements.

        This patch also removes an event dispatch assertion added in r212026. This assertion was added to catch any
        other events dispatched in this scope, since dispatching events there would have had security implications, but
        after making iteration over associated elements robust, this NoEventDispatchAssertion is no longer useful.

        [css-grid] Stretching auto tracks should be done as part of the track sizing algorithm

        It should be possible to compile shaders, attach them to a program,
        link the program, detach the shaders, delete the shaders, and then
        ask for the uniform and attribute locations. That is, once you've
        linked, the shaders can be thrown away.

        We were using the attached shaders to look up uniform locations, so
        we now keep around a separate map that remembers what shaders were
        attached when the program links.

        This fixes the bug, but the whole area is still a bit messy. For one,
        we're keeping around all the shader information even after it is

        It reduces the memory consumption and improves the performance. Also, since performance is better we don't need
        to keep the scroll surface allocated all the time, we can create it on demand and keep it allocated only while
        scrolling too fast.

        transformCanLikelyUseFastPath() can read off the end of a string

        Code added in r220382 could read one byte past the end of the string when looking for the 'z'
        of a rotateZ() function. The code was actually incorrect, testing for the 'z at i+6 after
        already incrementing i by 6. This patch makes the code correctly detect rotateZ().
        
        Also, rotate functions at the end of a string could be ignored because kShortestValidTransformStringLength
        was too long, so set it to the length of "rotate(0)", the shortest transform function that we currently
        fast-parse.

        There's an implicit assumption in this code that chars is not indexed past i+kShortestValidTransformStringLength.
        If the 'translate' path is taken, i is incremented by 9 (==kShortestValidTransformStringLength), but that's
        OK because WTF::find() doesn't index into chars if i >= length.

        The SVG fragment identifier is not respected if it is a part of an HTTP URL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163811

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        If an image is referenced more than once in a page and the URL to that
        image is an HTTP URL, one CachedImage is created for all the renderers
        even if the original URLs have different fragmentIdentifiers. In this
        case the fragment will be removed from the request which is associated
        with the shared CachedImage. This CachedImage creates an SVGImage with
        a URL but without a fragmentIdentifier. So SVGImage::draw() does not call
        FrameView::scrollToFragment() and therefore the viewport is not setup
        correctly for displaying the SVG in this case.

        The fix is to move the url from the SVGImage to SVGImageForContainer.
        Because there is one SVGImageForContainer created for every renderer,
        we can move the full URL there. The drawing of an SVGImage has to start
        from the SVGImageForContainer::draw() because the SVGImage may not have
        an intrinsic size and the SVGImageForContainer is the one which knows
        the destination rectangle. So SVGImageForContainer can pass the full url
        to SVGImage::drawForContainer() which can be used to scrollToFragment()
        before calling SVGImage::draw().
        
        For clarity and consistency, all setContainerSizeForRenderer() will be 
        changed to setContainerContext() and the pair SizeAndZoom will be replaced
        by the struct ContainerContext.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        If a tag is missing its closing bracket, the tokenizer just needs to advance()
        the character position without checking m_currentCharacter != '\n'. Newline
        character is a valid ending for partially closed tags.

        [SVG] Leak in SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172545

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff maintains a vector m_wrappers with references to
        SVGPropertyTraits<PropertyType>::ListItemTearOff. Apart from that SVGPropertyTearOff has a
        reference to SVGAnimatedProperty.

        When SVGListProperty::getItemValuesAndWrappers() is called, it creates a
        SVGPropertyTraits<PropertyType>::ListItemTearOff pointing to the same SVGAnimatedProperty (a
        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff) which stores the m_wrappers vector where the ListItemTearOff
        is going to be added to. This effectively creates a reference cycle between the
        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff and all the ListItemTearOff it stores in m_wrappers.

        In order to effectively break the cycle without freeing too many wrappers we should take two
        measures:
        1) Break the reference cycle by storing raw pointers in the m_wrappers Vector
        2) Remove the ListItemTearOff which is being deleted (it notifies the animated property by
        calling propertyWillBeDeleted) from the m_wrappers Vector.

        This is a re-land of r219334 which caused early releases of custom data attribute objects
        added to SVG elements (wkb.ug/175023).

        stopCheck is conceptually equivalent to calling a completion handler with PolicyIgnore just before cleaning up everything,

        InlineTextBox::paintDocumentMarker() does not need to special case painting of grammar and
        dictation alternatives
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175966

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Remove code that forced computing the marker rect for grammar and dictation alternative
        regardless of whether the marker spans the entire width of the line box. InlineTextBox::paintDocumentMarker()
        has performance optimizations to avoid computing the marker rect if it spans the entire line box.
        Prior to r190363 we had to opt out of these optimizations for grammar and dictation alternative
        markers so that we could store their computed marker rect. In r190363 we removed the logic in
        InlineTextBox::paintDocumentMarker() to store the computed marker rect and hence no longer
        needed to opt out of the optimization for these marker types, but inadvertently left in the
        conditional code that opts them out.

        No functionality changed. So no new tests.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Have BitmapTextureGL use direct OpenGL API entrypoints and constants
        instead of leveraging the GraphicsContext3D class. Any GraphicsContext3D
        object passed to BitmapTextureGL would assume rendering to the GL context
        that's current on that thread, translating method invocations to the
        OpenGL API. We can do this by ourselves and benefit by avoiding allocating
        GraphicsContext3D resources like the ANGLE compiler that are by most useful
        for WebGL.

        BitmapTextureGL::create() call sites are adjusted to stop passing a
        GraphicsContext3D reference. BitmapTextureGL::bindAsSurface() doesn't need
        a replacement for the passed-in GraphicsContext3D object since that object
        originated from the TextureMapperGL instance, whose GraphicsContext3D is by
        default of the render-to-current-context nature. Other changes are direct
        translations of GraphicsContext3D methods to OpenGL API calls, or of
        GraphicsContext3D values to OpenGL API constants.

        When the kinetic scrolling reduces its speed, there can be multiple frames where the movement is zero pixels,
        followed by a 1 pixel movement later on. This causes a "jitter" right at the end of the scroll which makes it

        Make ThreadGlobalData RefCounted for web thread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175439

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        When the web thread is enabled, we share ThreadGlobalData between the web thread and the main thread.
        The problem happens when the main thread is dying. It could start deallocating TLS and the web
        thread may see the destructed ThreadGlobalData.

        Even though, the current implementation is safe because the main thread do not perform TLS deallocation
        in the Darwin environment. But this is not true in Windows. And we should not rely on this condition
        that depends on the platforms.

        In this patch, we make ThreadGlobalData ThreadSafeRefCounted. This type verbosely describes that
        ThreadGlobalData could be shared between threads when the web thread enabled. And make the life time
        management simple instead of relying on the platform dependent TLS implementation.

        The issue here is that we manualy set the parent object of the AccessibilitySVGRoot object

        While this std::unique_ptr<T> shares one instance between main thread
        and web thread, this is the same to the current implementation. It is
        safe because the web thread never finishes.

        [Repaint from Layout Removal] Move layer repaint rects into a map
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175393

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Move the two repaint rects held by RenderLayer into a RenderLayerModelObject -> RepaintLayoutRects hash map.
        RepaintLayoutRects is a new struct that holds both rects.

        Eventually more objects than just self painting layers will be caching repaint rects, so this takes a first
        step towards having a common cache for these repaint rects. In addition this change saves memory, since
        layers that aren't self-painting no longer have empty repaint rects taking up space in RenderLayer.

        * bindings/js/DOMPromiseProxy.h: Added.
        (WebCore::DOMPromiseProxy<IDLType>):
        
            DOMPromiseProxy is a new class (set of classes) to represent promises that works with the 
            standard toJS<> / JSDOMConvert infrastructure used by the bindings generator. From the
            implementation perspective, it is similar to DOMPromiseDeferred, but instead of receiving
            one as a parameter, you can initialize it directly in your constructor and start using it.

            From the bindings perspective, a DOMPromiseProxy can be converted into a JS Promise by calling
            its promise function, which will either create a new promise, or return a cached one.

            To make this work, DOMPromiseProxy maintains a Vector of DeferredPromises that hold onto those
            actualized promises. The reason it has a Vector, is that we need one DeferredPromises per
            DOMWrapperWorld, just like we need one wrapper for an interface per DOMWrapperWorld in the 
            wrapper cache. In most cases, only the normal world will be in play, so the Vector has an inline
            capacity of one.
            
            In addition, DOMPromiseProxy maintains a Variant of either an Exception or the result value type.
            This allows the DOMPromiseProxy to be resolved or rejected at anytime. Then, when the bindings
            request the promise, the stored result / exception can be resolved / rejected into the promise.

        (WebCore::DOMPromiseProxy<IDLVoid>):

            For void promises, we need slightly different semantics (resolve takes no parameters, Value is
            a bit indicating resolved state), so it is specialized.

        (WebCore::DOMPromiseProxyWithResolveCallback<IDLType>):

            In addition to the void specialization, we have DOMPromiseProxyWithResolveCallback. Instead of
            storing the value of the resolution directly, this specialization allows the owner to specify
            callback to be called when the resolved value is needed. This is needed to avoid reference
            cycles when the resolved value is the owner such as is the case with FontFace and FontFaceSet.

            Also adds a mode to DeferredPromise to allow keeping the promise after resolution. Maintain
            the old behavior as the default.

            Change reject to take an Exception as sink rather than an r-value, to allow DOMPromiseProxy
            to copy a Exception into multiple DeferredPromises. For callers already moving into reject,
            this should be no change.

        [GStreamer] Don't use GraphicsContext3D in VideoTextureCoperGStreamer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174774

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        VideoTextureCoperGStreamer class creates a new GraphicsContext3D internally
        that's used to render to whichever OpenGL context is current. Such usage
        doesn't add anything to the user since there's no underlying offscreen-based
        OpenGL context created, and instead all GraphicsContext3D calls are directly
        translated to usual OpenGL API calls. We should avoid using GraphicsContext3D
        in such cases and instead use direct OpenGL API calls.

        This patch achieves that for the VideoTextureCoperGStreamer class. A
        GraphicsContext3D object is still created because it's needed to construct an
        instance of the TextureMapperShaderProgram class, but this will be removed as
        soon as TextureMapperShaderProgram drops the GraphicsContext3D dependence.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Any GraphicsContext3D object that's passed to ClipStack methods is of the

        context that has to be properly handled and all calls are simply passed to
        OpenGL APIs. We should drop such (non-)usage of GraphicsContext3D in favor
        of direct OpenGL API invocations.

        This patch covers TextureMapper's ClipStack. Call sites to the apply() and
        applyIfNeeded() are modified to not pass a reference to any
        GraphicsContext3D object. Internally, OpenGL API entrypoints and constants
        are used instead of GraphicsContext3D invocations.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Move the TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxyProvider class (which is the type
        aliased to PlatformLayer for threaded CoordGraphics) into its own header
        file. This prevents including the TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy.h header
        file in MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.h, avoiding spilling OpenGL types
        and function declarations before the GStreamer GL headers include them
        later in the MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase implementation file.

        In the MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase.h header file, only the new header
        is included, and a forward declaration of the TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy
        class is used. proxy() and swapBuffersIfNeeded() methods are moved into
        the implementation file to avoid requiring the full definition of the
        TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxy class.

        Similar is done for the TextureMapperGC3DPlatformLayer class and the
        Cairo-specific implementation of the ImageBufferData class. The
        CoordinatedGraphicsLayer implementation file also gains an include of the
        TextureMapperPlatformLayerProxyProvider.h header since it requires the full
        definition of that class.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175311

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Add and use TextureMapperContextAttributes, a slim struct that holds
        information about the type and extensions supported by the OpenGL
        context that's being used for one specific TextureMapperGL instance.

        This struct is initialized in the TextureMapperGL constructor for the
        OpenGL context that's been made current on that thread, and that will
        be used for that TextureMapperGL instance through its lifetime. The
        struct is then also copied into any BitmapTextureGL objects that have
        been created through this TextureMapperGL (or its texture pool).

        The struct is initialized with information about GLES2 support (which
        is at this point done through the USE_OPENGL_ES_2 macro) and about
        specific OpenGL extensions that are supported. These are then used in
        TextureMapperGL (NPOT textures) and BitmapTextureGL (BGRA support,
        sub-image unpacking) to deploy specific optimizations or workarounds.

        This ultimately serves as a replacement for clunky static functions
        that need to operate on GraphicsContext3D objects to retrieve this
        information.

        No new tests -- no change in behavior.

        RenderStyle:diff() was inadvertently doing deep compares of StyleRareNonInheritedData etc
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175304

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r210758 changed DataRef::get() from returning a pointer to a reference. This caused all the places
        in RenderStyle::diff() and related functions, where we intended to do a quick pointer comparison,
        to doing deep compares via operator!=. This made the code slightly slower.

        Fix by exposing ptr() on DataRef and using it wherever we wish to do pointer comparison.

        Update sendBeacon to use the FetchRequest / CachedResourceLoader instead of
        the PingLoader. This gets us closer to the specification which is based on
        Fetch and reduces code duplication. This also fixes an issue where our
        Origin header was not properly set on Beacon resquests.

        In a follow-up, we will implement in CachedResourceLoader Fetch's quota for

        RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image() should return the nullImage() if the image is not available

        <rdar://problem/33530130>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        If an <img> element has a non-CachedImage content data, e.g. -webkit-named-image,
        RenderImageResourceStyleImage will be created and  attached to the RenderImage.
        RenderImageResourceStyleImage::m_cachedImage will be set to null at the 
        beginning because the m_styleImage->isCachedImage() is false in this case.
        When ImageLoader finishes loading the url of the src attribute,
        RenderImageResource::setCachedImage() will be called to set m_cachedImage.

        A crash will happen when the RenderImage is destroyed. Destroying the 
        RenderImage calls RenderImageResourceStyleImage::shutdown() which checks
        m_cachedImage and finds it not null, so it calls RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image()
        which ends up calling CSSNamedImageValue::image() which returns a null pointer
        because the size is empty. RenderImageResourceStyleImage::shutdown() calls
        image()->stopAnimation() without checking the return value of image().

        Another crash will happen later when deleting the CachedImage from the memory
        cache if CachedImage::canDestroyDecodedData() is called because the client
        it gets from m_clients is a freed pointer. This happens because RenderImageResourceStyleImage
        has m_styleImage of type StyleGeneratedImage but its m_cachedImage is set
        by RenderImageResource::setCachedImage(). When RenderImageResourceStyleImage::shutdown()
        is called, it calls  StyleGeneratedImage::removeClient() which does not 
        know anything about RenderImageResourceStyleImage::m_cachedImage. So we 
        end up having a freed pointer in the m_clients of the CachedImage.

        Test: fast/images/image-element-image-content-data.html

        * rendering/RenderImageResourceStyleImage.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderImageResourceStyleImage::shutdown):  Revert back the changes
        of r208511 in this function. Add a call to image()->stopAnimation() without
        checking the return of image() since it will return the nullImage() if
        the image not available. There is no need to check m_cachedImage before 
        calling image() because image() does not check or access m_cachedImage.

        If m_styleImage is not a CachedStyleImage but m_cachedImage is not null,
        we need to remove m_renderer from the set of the clients of this m_cachedImage.

        (WebCore::RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image const): The base class method
        RenderImageResource::image() returns the nullImage() if the image not
        available. This is because CachedImage::imageForRenderer() returns
        the nullImage() if the image is not available; see CachedImage.h. We should
        do the same for the derived class for consistency.

        [EME][GStreamer] Register ClearKey CDMFactory
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175136

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Register the ClearKey CDM factory in CDMFactoryGStreamer. A CDMFactoryClearKey
        singleton object is introduced and used for that registration.

        The basic CDMFactoryClearKey and CDMPrivateClearKey methods are implemented,
        marking `org.w3.clearkey` as the supported key system and `keyids` as the
        supported init data type. Additional logic around key system configurations,
        distinctive identifiers, persistent state and related restrictions and
        requirements is implemented.

        This improves the ClearKey EME tests a bit, now progressing to the point of
        failing with a NotAllowedError exception due to the CDMInstance object failing
        to properly initialize because of missing implementation.

        No new tests -- relevant tests have underlying baselines updated to reflect
        changes in behavior.

        [EME] Push CDMFactory into the platform layer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175129

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        This is a follow-up to r219678 that moved the majority of CDM abstraction
        classes into the platform layer, but missed the CDMFactory class.

        The CDMFactory abstraction is now also placed in the platform layer. Only
        change to the interface is that the createCDM() method can't accept a CDM
        object reference anymore since that class is cemented into the WebCore
        layer, and no current implementation used it anyway.

        Additionally, the static Vector object of registered factories is moved
        under the CDMFactory class, along with the register and unregister
        functions. The platformRegisterFactories() function is added to allow for
        platform-specific factory registrations to occur when the registered
        factories are queried for the first time. Empty implementation for this
        function is provided for non-GStreamer platforms, while for GStreamer
        the implementation is kept in CDMFactoryGStreamer.cpp. It's still empty
        for now, but it will register the ClearKey factory there in the near
        future.

        No new tests -- none affected, only refactoring.

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        No new tests -- affected tests are now passing and are unskipped.

        Implement libgcrypt-based support for PKCS#8 imports of EC keys.

        Existing libtasn1 utilities are used to achieve this. First, the provided key data
        is decoded against the PrivateKeyInfo ASN.1 definition. First, the version member
        of that structure is validated, followed by the algorithm member. The latter is
        also properly tested depending on this being an import of an ECDSA or ECDH key.

        Data of the parameters member is decoded against the ECParameters ASN.1 definition,
        and the namedCurve object identifier is validated, making sure it represents a
        valid EC curve and that this curve maches the one specified for the import
        operation.

        Data of the privateKey member is decoded against the ECPrivateKey ASN.1 definition.
        The version member of that structure is properly validated. The optional parameters
        member of that structure is already decoded against the ECParameters ASN.1
        definition. If present, it is checked to contain a valid EC curve identifier that
        matches the specified curve.

        The optional publicKey member of the ECPrivateKey structure is validated, testing
        that its data matches in size an uncompressed EC point, and that the first byte
        of this data is 0x04, as expected for an uncompressed EC point.

        What's left is the private key data on the initial ECPrivateKey structure. That
        data is retrieved and validated, making sure its size matches the size of the
        specified curve. The `private-key` s-expression is then constructed, embedding
        the curve name and the validated private key data. This s-expression is then used
        to construct an EC context.

        If the optional publicKey data was provided, it's used to set the `q` parameter
        for this EC context. Otherwise, the value for `q` is computed on-the-fly for the
        specified EC and the provided private key. The `q` point is then tested through
        the gcry_mpi_ec_curve_point() function, making sure that the derived point is
        indeed located on the given EC.

        Finally, with the private key properly validated, a new CryptoKeyEC object is
        constructed, using the `private-key` s-expression and the parameters that were
        specified for this import operation.

        [WebIDL] Convert MutationCallback to be a normal generated callback
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174140

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        To make this work more nicely, I:
        - Added the ability to for non-nullable interfaces in sequences to be passed
          via a Ref<> rather than a RefPtr<> as a parameter to a callback function.
          (e.g. callback MyCallback = void (sequence<Foo> foos) will now have the 
          signature, CallbackResult<void> handleEvent(const Vector<Ref<Foo>>&) rather
          than CallbackResult<void> handleEvent(const Vector<RefPtr<Foo>>&).
        - Added a new extended attribute for callback functions called [CallbackThisObject=Type]
          which allows you to specify that the callback needs a this object in addition
          to its arguments. When specified, the first argument of the C++ implementation
          function will now correspond to the this object, with the remaining arguments
          shifted over one.
        - Converted callback objects to all inherit directly from ActiveDOMCallback rather
          than having the generated JS callback derived class inherit from it. This allows
          us to have access to a callback's canInvokeCallback() function anywhere (needed
          for MutationCallback) as well as giving a place to put an optional virtual 
          visitJSFunction to allow marking weak callbacks (while not an ideal layering, 
          this matches what we do in EventListener). This change requires each callback to
          have a bit more code to import the ActiveDOMCallback's constructor and requires
          non-JS derived callbacks to pass a ScriptExecutionContext (e.g. the Document).

        Support ::marker pseudo-element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141477

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Implements the ::marker pseudo element as per the CSS Pseudo-Element Module Level 4
        spec., <https://drafts.csswg.org/css-pseudo-4> (Editor's Draft, 24 July 2017).

        The ::marker pseudo element is a convenience pseudo element that allows a person to
        style the appearance of a list item marker. For example, to render all list item
        markers in bolded, blue text you would define a stylesheet with the following content:

        li::marker {
            color: blue;
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        and this could be applied to a page that contains markup of the form:

            <li>Item N</li>
        </ol>

        Formerly to the achieve the same effect you would need to use a stylesheet of the form:

        li {
            color: blue;
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        .list-item-content {
            all: initial;
        }

        and then write your markup to have the form:

        <ol>
            <li><span class="list-item-content">Item 1</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item-content">Item 2</span></li>
            ...
            <li><span class="list-item-content">Item N-1</span></li>
            <li><span class="list-item-content">Item N</span></li>
        </ol>

        The ::marker pseudo element only supports stylizing all font properties and the color property
        of a list item marker.

        <rdar://problem/31416763>

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        r207155 enabled sandboxing on the frame displaying a QuickLook preview. This restricted
        frames within the sandbox from navigating their sandboxed siblings or ancestors, which
        breaks the functionality of multi-sheet Numbers '09 spreadsheet previews. These previews
        contain a frameset with a table of contents frame and a content frame, and the table of
        contents frame needs to be able to navigate the content frame when the sheet selection
        changes.

        Fix this by disabling the SandboxNavigation flag in the QuickLook sandbox. Frames within the
        sandbox will be able to navigate each other, but will not be able to navigate the top frame
        (due to SandboxTopNavigation still being enabled), nor will they be able to navigate any
        other ancestor frame outside the sandbox (due to QuickLook previews being in a different
        origin than the hosting frame). These two cases are covered by existing tests.

        GPUBuffer::length() should return the size of the array buffer backing the GPU buffer, not the rounded-up GPU buffer length
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175079

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This fixes a failure in the GPU.BufferCreate unit test.
        
        The problem is that in order to have a Metal buffer wrap memory we allocated, we have to tell Metal
        that the memory is page-aligned. This means that the Metal buffer reports back a page-aligned size,
        which is different than what the test expected.
        
        It seems that it's most convenient for our GPUBuffer class to return the unaligned length, rather
        than the aligned length. This is just a simple matter of returning the length from the ArrayBuffer
        rather than the Metal buffer.
        
        This fixes the unit test and is probably more sensible for actual users of this class, since the page
        alignment of the length is a goofy implementation detail.

        Gather common constants used across the libgcrypt-specific Web Crypto

        container.

        Additionally, CryptoConstants::matches() helper function is provided. It
        compares the provided data-and-size pair with the given std::array
        container and returns true if the std::memcmp() call returns 0.

        Changes in CryptoKeyEC and CryptoKeyRSA consist mostly of switching to the
        use of CryptoConstants::matches() and the CryptoConstants data arrays, as
        well as some whitespace cleanup.

        load event delay below, one of the regression tests hangs because are permanently stuck

        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::scheduleUpdateForAfterStyleResolution): Added.
        Schedules a call to updateAfterStyleResolution when needed, and equally importantly,
        increments the load event delay count to make sure that loads that are part of that
        update can participate in decision about whether it's time for the load event.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::updateAfterStyleResolution): Added.
        Combines updateWidgetIfNecessary and startLoadingImage, and also deals with the new
        m_needsImageReload boolean in cases where no actual loading is done.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::didMoveToNewDocument): Update load event delay
        count when moving an element that is in the middle of loading. This lets the
        updateAfterStyleResolution function do the right thing even when the element is
        moved without leaving anything stuck in a strange state.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::prepareForDocumentSuspension): Call the new

        just a checkCompleted. This is relevant if the frame we are detaching was delaying
        a load event because it no longer will be and so the load might be complete.

        RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image() should return the nullImage() if the image is not available
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174874
        <rdar://problem/33530130>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        If an <img> element has image content data for a none cached image, e.g.
        -webkit-named-image, RenderImageResourceStyleImage will be created and 
        attached to the RenderImage. RenderImageResourceStyleImage::m_cachedImage
        will be set to null because the m_styleImage->isCachedImage() is false in
        this case. When ImageLoader finishes loading the url of the src attribute, 
        RenderImageResource::setCachedImage() will be called to set m_cachedImage.

        A crash will happen when the RenderImage is destroyed. Destroying the 
        RenderImage calls RenderImageResourceStyleImage::shutdown() which checks
        m_cachedImage and finds it not null, so it calls RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image()
        which ends up calling CSSNamedImageValue::image() which returns a null pointer
        because the size is empty. RenderImageResourceStyleImage::shutdown() calls
        image()->stopAnimation() without checking the return value of image().

        Like the base class virtual method RenderImageResource::image(), 
        RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image() should return the nullImage() if
        the image is not available.

        the image not available. There is no need to check m_cachedImage before 
        calling image() because image() does not check or access m_cachedImage.

        (WebCore::RenderImageResourceStyleImage::image): The base class method
        RenderImageResource::image() returns the nullImage() if the image not
        available. This is because CachedImage::imageForRenderer() returns
        the nullImage() if the image is not available; see CachedImage.h. We should
        do the same for the derived class for consistency.

        It seems that the "-Wunguarded-availability-new" pragma is not widely supported. So, a bunch of the
        Mac bots are now unable to build and that includes EWS.

        REGRESSION(r216944): Fallback fonts erroneously visible when the primary font is loading

        <rdar://problem/33267643>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        During a font load, we try pretty hard to find a font to use that isn't the
        last resort font (which happens to be Times). We do this by iterating through
        all the fonts in the font-family list, as well as through all the relevant
        @font-face blocks which share the requested font family name. 

        Unfortunately, if we find one of these fallback fonts, we were simply using it
        directly, which means that it was being drawn as visible (because the
        visibility setting lives inside the Font object). Instead, we should carry the
        invisibility setting from the interstitial font to this used fallback font.

        This patch is an extension of r219221, which fixed the problem only for system
        fallback fonts. This patch adopts the same methodology to all fallback fonts.

        For media documents, pressing the "done" button on fullscreen video navigates back

        when returning to inline. This allows the gesture to have the same behavior as the

        Hoist DOM binding attribute getter prologue into JavaScriptCore taking advantage of DOMJIT / CheckSubClass
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171637

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        We use DOMAttribute. When DOMAttribute is specified, ClassInfo check is performed by JSC side.
        So, we can drop ClassInfo check from the actual function.

        We also simplify DOMJIT::GetterSetter to make it smaller size.

        Performance improvement can be explained by the following optimizations.

        1. Type checks are typically eliminated in all the JIT tiers. IC / DFG / FTL can
           drop type checks since get_by_id operation already performs a structure check
           which subsumes this type check.
        2. Direct getter call by CallDOMGetter without creating IC in DFG and FTL.

        [EME] Allow CDMInstance type traits specialization
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174886

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        Allow using the trait-based type casting for the CDMInstance class and its
        derivatives. ImplementationType enumeration values are to be used and
        returned from the new implementationType() virtual method. This method is
        leveraged in the type trait specialization that enables using is<>() and
        downcast<>() helpers for CDMInstance objects.

        This will allow differentiating between CDMInstance implementations once
        the media playback pipeline has to retrieve any key information that's
        necessary for playback of encrypted content.

        MockCDMInstance class overrides the implementationType() method, returning
        the ImplementationType::Mock value. Type trait specializations for this
        class aren't added since they're not needed anywhere at this point.

        Implement crypto key serialization for platforms that use libgcrypt.

        Despite the function names and the existing implementation for the Mac port,
        we don't perform the KEK wrapping and unwrapping due to the review feedback
        advising against it.

        Instead the passed-in key data is simply copied and returned as the result of
        the 'wrapping' operation, and similarly the passed-in serialized data is simply
        copied and returned as the result of the 'unwrapping' operation.

        [EME][GStreamer] Multi-key support in the GStreamer ClearKey decryptor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174779

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        In the CENC decryptor, the key ID value is retrieved from the info structure
        on the GstProtectionMeta object. GstBuffer for that value is retrieved and
        passed to the setupCipher() function.

        In the ClearKey decryptor (which extends the CENC decryptor), the single
        GstBuffer object on the private instance that holds the key value is replaced
        with a Vector object that holds pairs of key ID and value GstBuffers. In the
        handleKeyResponse() implementation that Vector is emptied and then refilled
        with key ID and value pairs that are passed in through the drm-cipher-clearkey
        structure that's attached to the GstEvent that signalled new key information.

        In the ClearKey decryptor's setupCipher() implementation the passed-in key ID
        buffer is used to find a matching key ID and value pair stored on the private
        instance. If not found, an error is thrown. If found, the matching key value
        is used for decryption.

        [WPE] WebGL2 support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174249

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Implement WebGL2 support in GraphicsContext3DCairo for the WPE port, but keep
        the implementation specific to libepoxy (which WPE leverages by default).

        In the GraphicsContext3D::create() method, we first construct the
        GraphicsContext3D object that also ensures a current GL context on this thread.
        Only then can we determine through libepoxy whether the underlying GL library
        is able to support WebGL2.

        For WebGL2, the GLES3 support is required. The initial libepoxy implementation
        ensures this only in case of 'non-desktop GL' library of minimum version 3.0.
        This effectively translates to the only supported configuration being the
        EGL and OpenGL ES 3.0 (or higher) combination. If this cannot be ensured, we
        discard the existing GraphicsContext3D object and return null.

        WebGL2 can also be supported via OpenGL (i.e. 'desktop GL'), but this hasn't
        been tested yet. Implementation will in the future be extended to support that
        as required.

        In the GraphicsContext3D constructor itself, the ANGLEWebKitBridge constructor
        has to now receive the second argument, the desired shader specification that's
        used when parsing the provided shaders. This should be SH_WEBGL_SPEC for WebGL1,
        and SH_WEBGL2_SPEC for WebGL2.

        No new tests -- a small set of existing WebGL2 tests is unskipped and passing.

        Async image decoding for large images should be disabled after the first time a tile is painted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174451
        <rdar://problem/31246421>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Flashing because of DOM mutation can be fixed by disabling the asynchronous
        image decoding after the first time a tile was painted.

        We can detect this by consulting the tile repaintCount. If it is zero, then
        it is safe to use asynchronous image decoded. If the tile repaintCount is
        greater than zero, we are not sure if the renderer rectangle has an image
        drawn in it already or not. In this case we have to use the synchronous
        image decoding to avoid causing a flash.

        bindings to work as designed, and have the arguments come in as variadic 
        arguments to setTimeout/setInterval and get added to the ScheduledAction if
        needed. Also, move ContentSecurityPolicy check out of construction, and into

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Baidu.com (which uses jQuery), and various iOS apps make the assumption that getBoundingClientRect() returns a rectangle
        that can be used to set or compare with the scroll position. With visual viewports, that assumption is no longer valid
        when the page is zoomed, or when the keyboard has caused the visual viewport to detach from the layout viewport.

        At this point the compatibility cost of shipping layout viewport-based client rects seems higher than the gain, so revert
        to the shipping behavior. This reverts r216803, and will re-introduce bugs that occurred on zoomed pages on macOS,
        many of which are noted in webkit.org/b/170981.

        [WPE] libepoxy headers can use EGL_CAST, which might not be defined by eglplatform.h

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Newer versions of libepoxy provide EGL definitions that already use the EGL_CAST macro.
        We'd like to compile on systems where the eglplatform.h header doesn't yet provide
        that macro that was added only recently (e.g. it's available in Mesa 17.1, but not
        before).

        To address that, the EpoxyEGL.h header is added that first includes the libepoxy's EGL
        header and then provides the EGL_CAST definition in case the eglplatform.h header doesn't.
        This header should be included in place of <epoxy/egl.h> (which is included in this new
        header).

        The EpoxyEGL.h and EpoxyShims.h headers are also moved under the platform/graphics/epoxy/

        [iOS WK2] 5 DataInteractionTests are failing: observed selection rects after dropping don't match expected values
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174769
        <rdar://problem/33478864>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        These tests began failing after r219541, due to a change in behavior of whether or not we call
        setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false, RevealSelection::No) or setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false, RevealSelection::Yes)
        when performing a text editing drop.

        Before r219541, we would not reveal the selection when performing an edit drag operation. This is because in
        WebPage::performDragControllerAction, we would begin ignoring selection changes by calling
        setIgnoreSelectionChanges(true). However, while taking a text indicator snapshot, we would stop ignoring
        selection in TextIndicator::createWithRange due to us calling setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false,
        RevealSelection::No) at the end of the function. Then, when we return to the scope of
        WebPage::performDragControllerAction and try to setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false), this is a no-op because we've
        already stopped ignoring selection changes.

        After r219541, switching to using TemporarySelectionChange means that TextIndicator::createWithRange now means
        we respect whether or not we were already ignoring selection before taking the snapshot, so we won't always
        setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false) at the end. This means that selection changes will now be correctly ignored
        when performing a drag operation, but this also means that we'll try to reveal the selection, since
        WebPage::performDragControllerAction calls setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false), for which RevealSelection::Yes
        is used by default.

        Revealing the selection in WebPage::performDragControllerAction was unintended in the first place, so we should
        revert to calling setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false, RevealSelection::No). To ensure this, we adopt
        TemporarySelectionChange here and pass only TemporarySelectionOptionIgnoreSelectionChanges, so that we won't
        additionally try to reveal selection after the drop. This is consistent with behavior prior to macOS 10.13 and
        iOS 11. Additionally, this patch also moves the call to ignore selection change from WebKit into WebCore, so
        that whether we ignore selection is consistent across both WebKit1 and WebKit2.

        REGRESSION(r219045): A partially loaded image may not be repainted when its complete frame finishes decoding
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174230

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Because of r219045, we now only repaint the CachedImageClinets which tried
        to draw the image but they could not because they have to wait for the image
        decoding to finish. This was done by keeping a HashSet of these clients 
        and make CachedImage own it. This HashSet is cleared once the image frame
        finishes decoding and all the waited clients are repainted.

        But Multiple asynchronous image decoding requests are allowed for the same
        frame if new data is added to the image source. If we tried to draw the 
        same image twice before it finishes decoding the first request, we will
        not be to record this second request since the HashSet will not add the
        same client twice. When he second request finishes decoding, CachedImage
        will not repaint any client since its HashSet is empty.

        To fix this problem we can do the following. When an image frame finishes
        decoding, CachedImage will keep its HashSet of pending drawing clients as
        long as the image frame is a partially loaded frame.

        TextIndicator uses Range::borderAndTextQuads and ::absoluteTextRects
        in order to get the rects of the indicated text. Currently, these
        functions do not respect clipping, so clipped-out text (e.g. as seen
        inside links on Twitter) generates lots of meaningless indicated rects.

        Change adjustTextIndicatorDataOptionsForEstimatedColorsIfNecessary
        to instead be hasAnyIllegibleColors, and referred to in the same place
        as hasNonInlineOrReplacedElements, so that it follows the same
        upgrade path (leaving textRects empty, so that it is later filled in
        with the absoluteBoundingRect). This was a mistake in r219033, which
        instead would end up painting all content, but filling in textRects
        with the actual individual text rects.

        This alone changes the behavior on Twitter from lots of jagged misplaced
        rects to a too-large bounding rect. Combined with the following changes,
        the bounding rect is reduced to the right size:

        We used to not want to bloat the size of CSSValues with a pointer to the

        we have DeprecatedCSSOMValue, a wrapper for CSSValue that only gets created
        for the bindings, we no longer need the side table, and simply have the

        By definiton simple and normal line layout should always produce the exact same lineboxes. It enables us not
        to force repaint while swapping between these 2 line layouts.
        However in certain cases (font size pixel rounding as an example) they don't agree on how much content fits the line and
        that could result in missing/overlapping content due to the lack of repaint. 

        Unable to test.

        [CG] An image should not invoke many system calls before confirming its format is supported

        We should be careful when invoking system calls before confirming that the

        AudioTrackPrivateMediaStreamCocoa shouldn't set AudioSession::setPreferredBufferSize

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Manually tested for audio side effects.

        AudioChannel::copyFrom fails when AudioChannel lengths don't match.

        This happens because PlatformMediaSessionManager::updateSessionState() owns and sets
        AudioSession::setPreferredBufferSize().

        However, AudioTrackPrivateMediaStreamCocoa::createAudioUnit, when it creates an input
        audio unit is setting AudioSession::setPreferredBufferSize() directly to its own arbitrary value.

        AudioSession::setPreferredBufferSize() should be managed by the higher level 
        PlatformMediaSessionManager, and not modified by audio unit creation, in order to keep harmony
        within the audio pipeline.

        Turning those tests back on revealed a small bug that is unlikely to really affect content
        on the Web. In the case where the size of the video is known right away, without the need
        for loading its metadata, as is the case in the start-support-click-to-start.html test with
        a local media resource, all queued layouts are flushed at once and we may call the layout()
        method of the left ButtonsContainer which originally is set to contain the play/pause button,
        which would remove the play/pause button from the center of the media. So before we potentially
        set the play/pause button as the central button, we first assign the default button set for
        the two ButtonsContainer instances and only add the play/pause button when we're not showing
        the prominent play/pause button.

        Modules/encryptedmedia/ directory where the Web-facing API implementation resides.

        The two interfaces integrated closely with the Web-facing enumerations and
        dictionaries: MediaKeyMessageType, MediaKeySessionType, MediaKeyStatus,
        MediaKeySystemConfiguration, MediaKeySystemCapability, MediaKeysRequirement
        and MediaKeysRestrictions. Definitions of these types are also moved to the
        platform layer without any changes (apart from renaming), and the previous
        types now alias against the types now located in the platform layer.

        getBoundingClientRects not updated for programmatic scrolls
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174538
        rdar://problem/33049012

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Baidu.com has two event handlers on its <input>, and both query the input location with getBoundingClientRect()
        and the current pageYOffset (via jQuery), then try to scroll the input to the top of the screen. The bug is that
        programmatic scrolls did not immediately update the layout viewport rect, so the second call to
        getBoundingClientRect() would return stale coordinates, triggering an extra scroll.

        To fix this, undo the fix for r219320 which tried to keep getBoundingClientRect() current during unstable scroll
        updates by adding a shadow layout viewport rect. Instead, almost always update the layout viewport rect on
        FrameView, even during unstable visible rect updates, but not if content insets are being changed interactively,
        since changing viewport heights cause problems with bottom-fixed elements. Also, we need to compute a new layout
        viewport rect in FrameView::updateLayoutViewport() for programmatic scrolls.

        However, always updating the layout viewport triggered issues with the scrolling tree. The scrolling state tree
        fossilizes layer positions relative to a specific viewport rect, and that relationship has to be maintained.
        There are code paths that recompute fixed/sticky viewport constraints when the layout viewport has changed but
        we haven't done layout or recomputed layer positions (e.g. updating viewport-constrained layers via
        updateScrollCoordinatedLayersAfterFlush()) and in these cases using a new layout viewport for those computations
        results in an inconsistent scrolling tree.

        Fix this by not updating scrolling constraints every time we have to re-register scrolling nodes.
        updateScrollCoordinatedLayersAfterFlush() only needs to update the layer on the scrolling node (to handle
        tiled/non-tiled switches), so make updateScrollCoordinatedLayer() a little more fine-grained, and only update
        constraints when we've just computed layer geometry. This allows for different scrolling nodes to have
        constraints computed at different times, with different layout viewports, which happens.

        Two additional fixes were required to make bottom-fixed bars behave correctly.

        First, FrameView::computeLayoutViewportOrigin() had a bug where rounding of half-pixel values would cause it to
        fall into the if (visualViewport.height() > layoutViewport.height()) clause, but then fail to clamp for
        rubber-banding.
        
        Second, the FrameView::unscaledMaximumScrollPosition() was wrong after zooming on iOS, since it uses visibleSize()
        which is affected by page scale on iOS only (and the function wants scale-independent values). Fix with a hack that
        should be cleaned up via webkit.org/b/174648.

        Setting the minimum font size preference doesn’t affect absolute line-height values, so lines overlap

        When the minimumFontSize API preference is set, we will increase the font size without increasing
        the line height. If the content specifies line-height as an absolute value, there can be two
        unfortunate results:

        - Adjacent lines in a paragraph can overlap
        - If the paragraph (or containin block or whatever) uses overflow: hidden, the first and last lines
        can be cut off and potentially indecipherable.

        Instead, we should use the minimum font size preference as a signal that we should increase the
        line-height as well as the font-size. Eventually, we will want to increase it by an amount
        proportional to the increase in font-size (which can be due to minimumFontSize, minimumLogicalFontSize,
        text autosizing, etc.). However, because minimumLogicalFontSize is on by default, this would cause
        a behavior change on many webpages which use small text, so such a change would be too risky right now.
        Instead, we can pretend that minimumFontSize is the only cause that text increases, and use this as the

        [iOS] REGRESSION: Scrubbing media using built-in controls does not pause media
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174650
        <rdar://problem/33401877>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We would only pause when scrubbing on macOS because we only listened to "mousedown" events on the
        scrubber's backing <input> element to identify that the user had started interacting with the
        scrubber.

        Implementing the same technique on iOS required a little more work than just listening to "touchstart"
        events on the same element. On top of that, we needed to make sure that we would only respond to
        "touchstart" events on the slider's thumb, and not on the track, since only on macOS should the user
        be able to click anywhere on the track to scrub. So we turn off pointer-events for the <input> on iOS
        only, and turn them back on specifically for the thumb.

        There is also some finessing when dealing with touch events where we need to track the identifier of
        the touch that started the user interaction. So we keep track of it in an ivar and wait until we get
        a "touchend" event where the changedTouches list contains a touch with that same identifier to ensure
        the same touch that initiates and ends the scrubbing interaction.

        Finally, we fix another issue that was uncovered while turning back on the ScrubbingSupport tests
        where we would not trash the cached _value ivar when we initiated scrubbing, which was important since
        we would mistakenly use the pre-srubbing value during a scrub.

        The crash was caused by textMarkerDataForFirstPositionInTextControl accessing a nullptr returned by getOrCreate.
        Unfortunately, in order to this fix bug while preserving the exact behavior would require synchronously creating
        a renderer for the editing host when the input type changed since we can't create an accessbility object out of
        a renderer-less node.

        Instead, revert back to pre-r218910 behavior of always using the text control element's axID when notifying
        the value change. While this is inconsistent with the way editing commands report content changes, I've since
        learned that VoiceOver has code to deal with this exact situation.

        [iOS] WebKit media controls are sometimes shown after exiting full screen on vimeo.com
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174627
        <rdar://problem/33301005>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson, provisionally reviewed by Jeremy Jones.

        On iOS 11, both the WebKit media controls and the Vimeo custom controls would appear sometimes when exiting
        from fullscreen when the video was playing and the user would tap the X button, which would pause the video
        as well as exit fullscreen.

        The reason this happens is that the ControlsVisibilitySupport object, which governs whether the WebKit media
        controls should be displayed for a given video, woud listen to "pause" and "webkitfullscreenchange" events
        and determine whether to show the WebKit media controls. We listen to the "pause" event because when media
        pauses, and the video has the "controls" attribute set, we should show the controls and suspend the controls
        auto-hide timer. And we're interested in knowing when we enter and exit fullscreen because we want to override
        the "controls" attribute not being set when we enter fullscreen.

        However, on iOS 11, it appears that the "webkitfullscreenchange" event is not reliably fired as the user enters
        and exits fullscreen, which is tracked by webkit.org/b/174626. So, when the user exits fullscreen, we would be
        informed of the video being paused via a "pause" event, but not of the video exiting fullscreen. And because
        media events are asynchronous, the "pause" event would sometimes be fired before we exited fullscreen, and when
        the _updateControls() would run, we would sometimes determine that we are in fullscreen still and determine
        that the WebKit media controls should be shown.

        Of course, on iOS, the WebKit media controls are not shown and instead we delegate to AVKit to display media controls.
        So we could simply disregard this whole logic in iOS. But we choose to instead use the "webkitpresentationmodechanged"
        when the presentation mode API is supported, as is the case on iOS 11, to determine changes of media fullscreen state.
        This way, should we ever choose to support fullscreen media controls provided by WebKit on iOS, this logic is already
        correct and we write less platform-specific code.

        This, alas, cannot be tested since we can't force the X button to be tapped within the AVKit fullscreen controls.

        Async image decoding for large images should be disabled after the first time a tile is painted
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174451

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Flashing because of DOM mutation can be fixed by disabling the asynchronous
        image decoding after the first time a tile was painted.

        We can detect this by consulting the tile repaintCount. If it is zero, then
        it is safe to use asynchronous image decoded. If the tile repaintCount is
        greater than zero, we are not sure if the renderer rectangle has an image
        drawn in it already or not. In this case we have to use the synchronous
        image decoding to avoid causing a flash.

        * page/RuntimeEnabledFeatures.h: ... from here. Added Forward.h and Noncopyable.h.

        * platform/LocalizedStrings.cpp: Removed unneeded include of NeverDestroyed.h.

        * platform/MIMETypeRegistry.cpp:
        (WebCore::initializeSupportedImageMIMETypes): Added a missing const for a global
        constant array.
        (WebCore::initializeSupportedJavaScriptMIMETypes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::initializeSupportedNonImageMimeTypes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::typesForCommonExtension): Replaced the old mediaMIMETypeMap function
        with this one. Moved the common media types array here since it's only used here.
        Use const auto, makeNeverDestroyed, and a lambda instead of using an isEmpty check.
        Iterate the array using a mdoern for loop. Use HashMap::ensure to avoid the
        double hashing that the old code was doing. And moved the code to find an entry
        in the map in here from the client functions.
        (WebCore::MIMETypeRegistry::getMediaMIMETypeForExtension): Updated to use the
        typesForCommonExtension, and changed logic to use this first, and only call
        getMIMETypeForExtension for extensions not in the map. This gives the same
        result but should be slightly more efficient.
        (WebCore::MIMETypeRegistry::getMediaMIMETypesForExtension): Updated to use the
        typesForCommonExtension function. Comment about strategy is now in there.
        (WebCore::initializeUnsupportedTextMIMETypes): Added a missing const for a global
        constant array. Also started using ASCIILiteral.

        * platform/MainThreadSharedTimer.cpp: Moved include of NeverDestroyed.h here ...
        * platform/MainThreadSharedTimer.h: ... from here. Added Forward.h.

        * platform/SchemeRegistry.cpp:
        (WebCore::add): Added helper functions to keep code below simpler.
        (WebCore::makeNeverDestroyedSchemeSet): Ditto.
        (WebCore::allBuiltinSchemes): Use const auto, makeNeverDestroyed, a lambda,
        and the helper functions above, rather than isEmpty.
        (WebCore::builtinLocalURLSchemes): Use const auto, makeNeverDestroyed, and
        the HashSet constructor instead of isEmpty and add calls. Also changed the
        return type to be const.
        (WebCore::localURLSchemes): Copy the map using assignment instead of an
        isEmpty function and a loop with calls to add.
        (WebCore::builtinSecureSchemes): Use const auto, makeNeverDestroyed, and
        the Vector constructor rather than isEmpty, repeated calls to append,
        and shrinkToFit.
        (WebCore::secureSchemes): Use auto and makeNeverDestroyedSchemeSet rather
        than isEmpty and repeated calls to add.
        (WebCore::builtinSchemesWithUniqueOrigins): More of the same.
        (WebCore::schemesWithUniqueOrigins): Ditto.
        (WebCore::builtinEmptyDocumentSchemes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::emptyDocumentSchemes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::schemesForbiddenFromDomainRelaxation): Ditto.
        (WebCore::builtinCanDisplayOnlyIfCanRequestSchemes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::canDisplayOnlyIfCanRequestSchemes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::builtinCORSEnabledSchemes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CORSEnabledSchemes): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsLocal): Replaced check for
        empty string with check for null string, since that's slightly more efficient
        for non-null, non-empty strings, and the hash table can handle empty strings
        just fine.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsNoAccess): Added null check here.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsNoAccess): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsDisplayIsolated): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsDisplayIsolated): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsSecure): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsSecure): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsEmptyDocument): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldLoadURLSchemeAsEmptyDocument): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::setDomainRelaxationForbiddenForURLScheme): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::isDomainRelaxationForbiddenForURLScheme): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::canDisplayOnlyIfCanRequest): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerAsCanDisplayOnlyIfCanRequest): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsNotAllowingJavascriptURLs): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsNotAllowingJavascriptURLs): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsAllowingLocalStorageAccessInPrivateBrowsing): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::allowsLocalStorageAccessInPrivateBrowsing): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsAllowingDatabaseAccessInPrivateBrowsing): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::allowsDatabaseAccessInPrivateBrowsing): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsCORSEnabled): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldTreatURLSchemeAsCORSEnabled): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsBypassingContentSecurityPolicy): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::removeURLSchemeRegisteredAsBypassingContentSecurityPolicy): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::schemeShouldBypassContentSecurityPolicy): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsAlwaysRevalidated): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldAlwaysRevalidateURLScheme): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::registerURLSchemeAsCachePartitioned): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::shouldPartitionCacheForURLScheme): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::isUserExtensionScheme): Tweaked #if a bit.
        (WebCore::SchemeRegistry::isBuiltinScheme): Added null check.

        * platform/cocoa/WebVideoFullscreenModelVideoElement.mm:
        (WebVideoFullscreenModelVideoElement::observedEventNames): Use const auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, and the Vector constructor rather than a call to size
        and then append eacn time this funciton is called.

        * platform/gamepad/cocoa/GameControllerGamepadProvider.h: Moved include of
        NeverDestroyed.h from here ...
        * platform/gamepad/cocoa/GameControllerGamepadProvider.mm: ... to here.

        * platform/gamepad/mac/HIDGamepadProvider.cpp: Moved include of
        NeverDestroyed.h here ...
        * platform/gamepad/mac/HIDGamepadProvider.h: ... from here.

        * platform/graphics/FontCascade.cpp:
        (WebCore::FontCascade::hasValidAverageCharWidth): Use const auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, and the HashSet constructor.

        * platform/graphics/ImageBuffer.cpp:
        (WebCore::ImageBuffer::transformColorSpace): Removed unneeded use of
        NeverDestroyed<Vector<int>> here, instead using const std::array.

        * platform/graphics/ImageBuffer.h: Changed platformTransformColorSpace to take
        const std::array<uint8_t, 256>& instead of const Vector<int>&, since the whole
        pointer of the argument is that it's a table to map bytes onto other bytes.

        * platform/graphics/MediaPlaybackTarget.h: Removed unneeded include of
        NeverDestroyed.h, unneeded unused noMediaPlaybackTargetContext function,
        and unneeded include of MediaPlaybackTargetContext.h, forward declaring instead.
        Made most functions in this class pure virtual instead of having default
        implementations.

        * platform/graphics/avfoundation/MediaPlaybackTargetMac.h: Added include
        of MediaPlaybackTargetContext.h now that it was removed above.

        * platform/graphics/avfoundation/MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundation.cpp:
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundation::staticMIMETypeList): Use const auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, and the HashSet constructor.

        * platform/graphics/avfoundation/objc/MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC.mm:
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC::isAvailable): Reversed the sense
        of the boolean logic here to make this simpler and easier to read.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC::getSupportedTypes): Changed
        the implementation here, which empties out the passed in hash set, to use
        the clear function rather than assignment from a global empty hash set. Added
        a FIXME because it seems peculiar that this would be considered OK.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC::supportsType): Used ? : to make
        this a little more terse; I think it's clearer.

        * platform/graphics/cairo/ImageBufferCairo.cpp:
        (WebCore::ImageBuffer::platformTransformColorSpace): Updated for change to
        argument type.

        * platform/graphics/cg/ImageDecoderCG.cpp: Removed unneeded include of
        NeverDestroyed.h.
        (WebCore::appendImageSourceOption): Streamlined code using auto with
        adoptCF; there is no need to write out the type of the RetainPtr.
        (WebCore::imageSourceOptions): Instead of NeverDestroyed<RetainPtr>, just use
        const auto and leakRef.
        (WebCore::imageSourceAsyncOptions): Ditto.

        * platform/graphics/gtk/GdkCairoUtilities.cpp:
        (WebCore::getDefaultCairoFontOptions): Instead of using LazyNeverDestroyed
        on a pointer, just use a global pointer. There is no need to use any kind
        of NeverDestroyed on a type with a trivial destructor such as a pointer.

        * platform/graphics/ios/FontCacheIOS.mm:
        (WebCore::platformFontWithFamilySpecialCase): Instead of using
        NeverDestroyed<RetainPtr> just use a raw pointer global.
        * platform/graphics/mac/FontCacheMac.mm:
        (WebCore::platformFontWithFamilySpecialCase): Ditto.

        * platform/graphics/mac/MediaPlayerPrivateQTKit.mm:
        (WebCore::createFileTypesSet): Return the HashSet instead of adding to it.
        Use Objective-C for/in syntax for an NSArray, not C++ for syntax, although
        it seems the C++ syntax was working fine.
        (WebCore::mimeCommonTypesCache): Fixed return type so we won't copy the
        HashMap every time this function is called. Use const auto and makeNeverDestroyed
        instead of using a boolean to do one time initialization.
        (WebCore::mimeModernTypesCache): Ditto.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateQTKit::disableUnsupportedTracks): Marked a
        constant array const.

        * platform/ios/Device.cpp:
        (WebCore::deviceClass): Use a lambda to initialize a variable here instead
        of using std::call_once. This function does not need to be thread safe.
        (WebCore::deviceName): Use const NeverDestroyed instead of LazyNeverDestroyed
        and std::call_once. This function does not need to be thread safe.

        * platform/ios/DragImageIOS.mm: Make defaultLinkIndicatorOptions be a
        constant instead of a variable.
        (WebCore::cascadeForSystemFont): Added helper function.
        (WebCore::createDragImageForLink): Use const auto and makeNeverDestroyed
        instead of LazyNeverDestroyed and dispatch_once. This code does not need
        to be thread safe since its arguments include, for example, a DOM element.

        * platform/ios/LegacyTileLayerPool.h: Removed unneeded include of
        NeverDestroyed.h.

        * platform/ios/QuickLook.mm:
        (WebCore::QLPreviewGetSupportedMIMETypesSet): Use a global raw pointer
        instead of NeverDestroyed<RetainPtr<NSSet>>.
        (WebCore::createQLPreviewProtocol): Deleted.
        (WebCore::QLPreviewProtocol): Use a global raw pointer instead of
        a NeverDestroyed<Vector<char>>. It's cleaner to use fastStrdup instead
        of appending to an array, and less wasteful of memory too.

        * platform/ios/WebCoreMotionManager.mm: Removed unneeded include of
        NeverDestroyed.h.
        * platform/ios/WebSQLiteDatabaseTrackerClient.h: Ditto.
        * platform/mac/DragImageMac.mm: Ditto.
        * platform/mediastream/CaptureDeviceManager.cpp: Ditto.
        * platform/mediastream/RealtimeMediaSourceSupportedConstraints.cpp: Ditto.

        * platform/mock/MockRealtimeMediaSource.cpp:
        (WebCore::MockRealtimeMediaSource::audioDevices): Use auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, and a lambda instead of checking size each time.
        (WebCore::MockRealtimeMediaSource::videoDevices): Ditto.

        * platform/mock/mediasource/MockMediaPlayerMediaSource.cpp:
        (WebCore::mimeTypeCache): Use const auto, makeNeverDestroyed, and the
        HashSet constructor instead of an explicit boolean to initialize.

        * platform/network/BlobRegistryImpl.cpp:
        (WebCore::blobUtilityQueue): Use a global with a raw reference instead
        of a NeverDestroyed<Ref>.

        * platform/network/NetworkStateNotifier.cpp:
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::singleton): Renamed this from
        networkStateNotifier. We must have missed this when we changed to use the
        singleton idiom consistently. Also changed to use normal NeverDestroyed
        rather than using LazyNeverDestroyed and call_once, because this is not
        used from multiple threads and has no special thread safety requirements.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::NetworkStateNotifier): Moved the constructor
        here and construct the timer. Before the timer was used only on the Mac
        platform but now it is there for all platforms.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::onLine): Moved function here from the header.
        It's a littlel less trivial than before because it now triggers a call to
        updateState as needed.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::addListener): Renamed from
        addNetworkStateChangeListener since there is only one kind of listener and
        the old name was too wordy. Changed to call the new startObserving function,
        and guaranteed to call it onlh once. The platform-specific logic for iOS is
        now inside the iOS version of that function instead of here.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::updateState): Moved here now that it is the
        same for all platforms. The actual state updating is done in a function named
        updateStateWithoutNotifying, which is implemented for each platform.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateSoon): New function which takes
        advantage of the timer to coalesce network state updates.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateWithoutNotifying): Empty stub
        version of this function.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::startObserving): Ditto.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::notifyNetworkStateChange): Deleted. Code from
        this has moved into updateState.

        * platform/network/NetworkStateNotifier.h: Greatly cut down what part of this
        class is platform-specific.

        * platform/network/ios/NetworkStateNotifierIOS.mm:
        (-[WebNetworkStateObserver initWithBlock:]): Simplified this class so it
        takes a block, rather than using a pointer to the C++ notifier and doing
        WebThreadRun.
        (-[WebNetworkStateObserver dealloc]): Ditto.
        (-[WebNetworkStateObserver networkStateChanged:]): Ditto.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateWithoutNotifying):
        This now calls isNetworkReachable.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::startObserving): Check the
        Settings::shouldOptOutOfNetworkStateObservation function, and if it's OK
        to observe, then create the observer. This code now takes care of the
        WebThreadRun and calls updateStateSoon.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::NetworkStateNotifier): Deleted. The
        constructor is now platform independent.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::~NetworkStateNotifier): Deleted. This
        object is never destroyed so we should not write a destructor for it.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::registerObserverIfNecessary): Deleted.
        Replaced by startObserving.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::onLine): Deleted. This function is now
        platform-independent.
        (WebCore::setOnLine): Deleted. The logic from this is now in
        updateState and updateStateWithoutNotifying.

        * platform/network/mac/NetworkStateNotifierMac.cpp:
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateWithoutNotifying): Renamed
        this from updateState and tightened up the code a bit. Also changed
        to not assume anything. If there is an error, we leave m_isOnLine alone.
        Default behavior is now in the platform-independent code, and the default
        is to treat things as on-line if updateStateWithoutNotifying was called
        and it was never able to update the state even once.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::startObserving): Moved most of the code
        from the constructor into this function.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::dynamicStoreCallback): Deleted. This is
        now a lambda inside startObserving.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::networkStateChangeTimerFired): Deleted.
        This function is now platform-independent and is named updateState.

        * platform/network/win/NetworkStateNotifierWin.cpp:
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::updateStateWithoutNotifying): Renamed
        from updateState and tightened the code up a bit. Also changed
        to not assume anything. If there is an error, we leave m_isOnLine alone.
        Default behavior is now in the platform-independent code, and the default
        is to treat things as on-line if updateStateWithoutNotifying was called
        and it was never able to update the state even once.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::addressChanged): Deleted.
        This function is now platform-independent and is named updateState.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::addressChangeCallback): Renamed from
        addrChangeCallback. Simplified by using the singleton function instead
        of relying on the context pointer.
        (WebCore::NetworkStateNotifier::startObserving): Moved most of the code
        from the constructor here.

        * platform/text/LocaleToScriptMappingDefault.cpp:
        (WebCore::scriptNameToCode): Use makeNeverDestroyed.
        (WebCore::localeToScriptCodeForFontSelection): Ditto.

        * platform/text/ios/LocalizedDateCache.h: Moved include of
        NeverDestroyed.h from here ...
        * platform/text/ios/LocalizedDateCache.mm: ... to here.

        * platform/wpe/RenderThemeWPE.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTheme::singleton): Use a theme that is never destroyed
        rather than Ref that is never destroyed.

        * platform/wpe/RenderThemeWPE.h: Use friend NeverDestroyed rather than
        a create function since RenderTheme is no longer reference counted.

        * rendering/RenderTheme.h: Made RenderTheme no longer reference counted.

        * rendering/RenderThemeGtk.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderThemeGtk::create): Deleted.
        (WebCore::RenderTheme::singleton): Use a theme that is never destroyed
        rather than Ref that is never destroyed.

        * rendering/RenderThemeGtk.h: Use friend NeverDestroyed rather than
        a create function since RenderTheme is no longer reference counted.
        * rendering/RenderThemeIOS.h: Ditto.

        * rendering/RenderThemeIOS.mm:
        (WebCore::RenderThemeIOS::create): Deleted.
        (WebCore::RenderTheme::singleton): Use a theme that is never destroyed
        rather than Ref that is never destroyed.

        * rendering/RenderThemeMac.h: Use friend NeverDestroyed rather than
        a create function since RenderTheme is no longer reference counted.
        Also marked a lot of functions final rather than override and initialized
        data members in the class deifnition.

        * rendering/RenderThemeMac.mm: Moved some SPI interfaces to the top of the
        file. They should really go into SPI headers.
        (-[WebCoreRenderThemeNotificationObserver init]): Removed the theme argument
        here because the theme is a singleton and we don't need a pointer to it.
        Add the observer here instead of doing it in the caller.
        (-[WebCoreRenderThemeNotificationObserver systemColorsDidChange:]): Call
        platformColorsDidChange through the singleton rather than using a pointer.
        (-[WebCoreTextFieldCell _coreUIDrawOptionsWithFrame:inView:includeFocus:]):
        Tightened up the code a bit by using CFAutorelease instead of using a
        combination of NSMakeCollectable, autorelease, and a typecast to accomplish
        the same thing.
        (WebCore::RenderTheme::singleton): Use a theme that is never destroyed
        rather than Ref that is never destroyed.
        (WebCore::RenderThemeMac::create): Deleted.
        (WebCore::RenderThemeMac::RenderThemeMac): Moved initialization into the
        class definition and observing into the WebCoreRenderThemeNotificationObserver
        init function.
        (WebCore::RenderThemeMac::~RenderThemeMac): Deleted. No need for this since
        the object will never be destroyed.
        (WebCore::RenderThemeMac::mediaControlsBase64StringForIconNameAndType):
        Removed an unnecessary conversion from C string literal to WTF::String and
        then to NSString. Instead, just use an NSString literal.

        * rendering/RenderThemeWin.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderThemeWin::create): Deleted.
        (WebCore::RenderTheme::singleton): Use a theme that is never destroyed
        rather than Ref that is never destroyed.

        * rendering/RenderThemeWin.h: Use friend NeverDestroyed rather than
        a create function since RenderTheme is no longer reference counted.

        * rendering/svg/RenderSVGResource.cpp:
        (WebCore::removeFromCacheAndInvalidateDependencies): Moved a global into
        the code where it is used.

        * svg/SVGAnimatedLength.cpp: Removed unneeded include of NeverDestroyed.h.

        * svg/SVGAnimationElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGAnimationElement::isSupportedAttribute): Use const auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, a lambda, and the new HashSet::add overload instead of
        an isEmpty check and lots of separate add function calls.
        * svg/SVGClipPathElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGClipPathElement::isSupportedAttribute): Ditto.
        * svg/SVGComponentTransferFunctionElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGComponentTransferFunctionElement::isSupportedAttribute): Ditto.
        * svg/SVGCursorElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGCursorElement::isSupportedAttribute): Ditto.

        * svg/SVGElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::createAttributeNameToCSSPropertyIDMap): Replaced the populate
        function with this create function.
        (WebCore::createAttributeNameToAnimatedPropertyTypeMap): Ditto.
        (WebCore::attributeNameToAnimatedPropertyTypeMap): Changed return type to
        const reference. Use const auto and makeNeverDestroyed instead of using
        isEmpty and a populate function.
        (WebCore::createCSSPropertyWithSVGDOMNameToAnimatedPropertyTypeMap):
        More of the same.
        (WebCore::cssPropertyWithSVGDOMNameToAnimatedPropertyTypeMap): Ditto.
        (WebCore::SVGElement::childShouldCreateRenderer): Use an array instead of
        a HashSet since we are checking against only 3 or 4 values.
        (WebCore::addQualifiedName): Deleted.
        (WebCore::SVGElement::animatableAttributeForName): Use const auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, and a lambda to efficiently build the map in this function.
        (WebCore::SVGElement::cssPropertyIdForSVGAttributeName): Use const auto and
        makeNeverDestroyed instead of using isEmpty and a populate function.

        * svg/SVGFilterElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGFilterElement::isSupportedAttribute): Use const auto,
        makeNeverDestroyed, a lambda, and the new HashSet::add overload instead of
        an isEmpty check and lots of separate add function calls.
        * svg/SVGFilterPrimitiveStandardAttributes.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGFilterPrimitiveStandardAttributes::isSupportedAttribute): Ditto.
        * svg/SVGForeignObjectElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGForeignObjectElement::isSupportedAttribute): Ditto.

        [iOS DnD] Web process uses too much memory when beginning a drag on a very large image
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174585
        <rdar://problem/33302541>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, attempting to drag a very large image fails, either due to us telling CoreGraphics to create an image
        buffer that is too large, or because the web process exceeds its memory limit and gets jetsamed. There are two
        places where we can optimize our memory use during the drag initialization sequence, and this patch improves
        both.

        First, on iOS, we attempt to encode and send over a WebCore::Image in the PasteboardImage when writing to the
        item providers upon starting a drag. Currently, this Image is only used in the drag and drop codepath, in
        PlatformPasteboard::writeObjectRepresentations, to grab the size of the image being written for the purpose of
        specifying estimated display size. Serializing and deserializing an Image calls into Image::nativeImage, which
        attempts to draw the contents of the image into a buffer so that it can be shipped across to the UI process.
        Instead, we can simply compute the size in the web process while we already have the Image, and simply send that
        across. For copy/paste, this doesn't result in any behavior change, since we don't use the PasteboardImage's
        image in the first place.

        Secondly, when starting a drag, we try to allocate create an image buffer the size of the WebCore::Image for the
        purpose of generating the drag preview. Instead, this patch establishes a limit on the size of this drag preview
        image, such that if the Image's size is larger, we'll scale down the drag preview image to be the maximum
        allowed size.

        Test: DataInteractionTests.CanStartDragOnEnormousImage.

        We now correctly account for all of those cases and implement the following behavior when clickng as the tracks

            - dismiss the panel if the click is outside of the panel
            - dismiss the panel and the media controls if the click is outside the video and the media controls have

        Rename RenderStyle::fontSize() to RenderStyle::computedFontPixelSize()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174509

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We have three font size functions:
        - computedFontSize(): returns a float
        - specifiedFontSize(): also returns a float
        - fontSize(): returns the rounded computedFontSize()

        FontDescription uses the convention of labelling rounded values as "pixel",
        so a better name font fontSize() is computedFontPixelSize().

        Also, because font sizes can never be negative, switch the type from an int
        to an unsigned.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        StyleBuilderConverter::convertLineHeight() converts line-height: <number> into a
        "percentage" length. Then, when layout needs to know what the computed value of
        line-height is, RenderStyle::computedLineHeight() multiplies this percentage by
        the computed font size.

        With autosizing, the computed font size already incorporates the autosizing
        multiplier, so we shouldn't also incorporate this multiplier into the percentage
        value itself. getComputedStyle()'s lineHeightFromStyle() was compensating for
        this double application by multiplying the percentage by the font-size's specified
        value instead of its computed value, which is incorrect.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Currently, if TextIndicator fails to take a snapshot in TextIndicator::createWithRange, we will enter an
        inconsistent state in the web process where Editor will continue to ignore selection changes until the next time
        Editor::setIgnoreSelectionChanges(false) is called. This causes us to indefinitely defer EditorState updates to
        the UI process, which leads to selection UI appearing unresponsive.

        To fix this, we introduce a new TemporarySelectionChange object to simplify selection changes and/or
        EditorState-update-ignoring behaviors within the scope of a single function. The constructor applies these
        temporary changes, and the destructor reverts them as needed to their prior values.

        This patch only adopts TemporarySelectionChange in order to fix this bug, but future patches will replace the
        remaining places where we temporarily change selection and/or ignore selection with this helper.

        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyRSA PKCS#8 exports
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173697

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Implement the PKCS#8 import operation for RSA keys for platforms that use
        libgcrypt.

        In CryptoKeyRSA::exportPkcs8(), we bail early with an invalid access exception if
        this export is not being done for a private key. Otherwise, we start with creating
        the `RSAPrivateKey` ASN.1 structure, writing out '0' under the `version` element
        and then retrieving the modulus, public and private exponent and both primes.
        MPI data for those parameters is written out into corresponding elements in the
        `RSAPrivateKey` structure. We then manually compute values of both exponents and
        the coefficient parameters, using the private exponent's and both primes' MPI
        values. The p and q parameters (i.e. the primes) are switched in libgcrypt,
        deviating from the standard practice, so we have to operate with those two
        accordingly. We eliminate the optional `otherPrimeInfos` attribute on the
        `RSAPrivateKey` structure. Support for this attribute will be added later.

        We then create the `PrivateKeyInfo` ASN.1 structure, and write out '0' under the
        `version` element. The id-rsaEncryption object identifier is written out under
        the `algorithm.algorithm` element. In the future, an object identifier that
        matches this key's algorithm will have to be written out here (id-RSASSA-PSS or
        id-RSAES-OAEP), along with the appropriate parameters structure, but no test in
        WebKit or the web-platform-tests suite covers this detail. For now, a null value
        is written out under the `algorithm.parameters` element.

        Data for the `RSAPrivateKey` structure is retrieved and written out under the
        `privateKey` element.  The optional `attributes` element on the `PrivateKeyInfo`
        structure is eliminated.

        Data that was encoded through the `PrivateKeyInfo` structure is then retrieved
        and returned from the exportPkcs8() method.

        No new tests -- related tests are now passing and are unskipped.

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Implement the PKCS#8 import operation for RSA keys for platforms that use
        libgcrypt.

        In CryptoKeyRSA::importPkcs8(), the provided key data is decoded against the
        'PrivateKeyInfo` ASN.1 structure. We then validate the `version` element and
        check that the `privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm` element contains a supported
        object identifier. This check is for now mostly superficial, only ensuring
        that the object identifier is either id-rsaEncryption, id-RSAES-OAEP or
        id-RSASSA-PSS. This has to be further extended to also check the
        id-sha{1,256,384,512}WithRSAEncryption identifiers as well as decoding the
        `privateKeyAlgorithm.parameters` element against a specific ASN.1 structure, if
        necessary (RSASSA-PSS-params or RSAES-OAEP-params), and cross-checking the
        specified digest algorithm with the algorithm that's specified through the main
        object identifier or the structure contained in `privateKeyAlgorithm.parameters`.
        This is avoided for now because no test in WebKit or the web-platform-tests
        suite covers this detail of the specification.

        Data under the `privateKey` element is decoded against the `RSAPrivateKey` ASN.1
        structure, and the `version` element of that structure is validated. We then
        retrieve data from that structure for the modulus, public exponent, private
        exponent, both primes, both exponents and the coefficient parameters, bailing if
        any of them is missing. Because libgcrypt switches the use of p and q parameters,
        deviating from the standard use, we have to recompute the u parameter (the
        coefficient). With that calculated, we're then able to construct the `private-key`
        s-expression, embedding into it all the necessary parameters, and transferring
        the ownership of this object to the new CryptoKeyRSA object that's then returned
        from the importPkcs8() method.

        No new tests -- related tests are now passing and are unskipped.

        This patch adds a timer to CoreAudioSharedUnit.
        In case the capture callback is not called after one second, the shared unit is said to fail.
        Each source is notified that capture is failing.
        This will in turn trigger onend track event so that web pages can remedy capture failure.

        Timer starts with 10 seconds for audio data to start being captured.
        It is then decreased to 2 seconds.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This could happen when a Page containing an SVGImage is removed from PageCache and
        this resulted in the destruction of the SVGImage. Because the SVGImage has an internal
        utility Page, it will also call PageCache::removeAllItemsForPage(WebCore::Page&) upon
        destruction, causing us to reenter.

        Address the issue by not calling PageCache::removeAllItemsForPage() for utility pages
        since those cannot be in PageCache in the first place.

        Also add assertions to make sure:
        1. We never insert a utility page into PageCache
        2. PageCache::removeAllItemsForPage() does not reenter

        No new tests, because I was unable to write a test which reproduced the crash. This
        is in theory testable using an API test which enables PageCache, loads a page
        containing an SVGImage, navigates away from this page so that it goes into PageCache,
        and then calls [WebView _close]. However, when I tried writing such test, I could
        not get the SVGImage to get destroyed while PageCache::removeAllItemsForPage() is
        called for the top-level page for some reason. Something seems to be keeping the
        SVGImage alive longer. I tried disabling the MemoryCache but it did not help.

        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyRSA SPKI exports
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173695

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Implement the SPKI export operation for RSA keys for platforms that use
        libgcrypt.

        In CryptoKeyRSA::exportSpki(), we bail early with an invalid access exception if
        this export is not being done for a public key. Otherwise, we start with creating
        the `RSAPublicKey` ASN.1 structure, filling in the modulus and public exponent
        data that's retrieved from the `public-key` s-expression in the signed MPI format.

        We then create the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` ASN.1 structure and fill it out with
        the necessary data. The id-rsaEncryption object identifier is written out under
        the `algorithm.algorithm` element, and a null value is written out under the
        `algorithm.parameters` element. This doesn't follow the specification at the
        moment, since id-RSASSA-PSS would have to be written for the RSA-PSS algorithm,
        and id-RSAES-OAEP for the RSA-OAEP algorithm, along with specific parameter
        structures. But no test in WebKit or the web-platform-tests suite covers this,
        so this deviation should be addressed later.

        Data of the previously-constructed `RSAPublicKey` structure is retrieved and
        written out under the `subjectPublicKey` element, before finally retrieving
        data of the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` structure and returning that to the caller.

        A helper mpiSignedData() function is added, providing overloads for gcry_mpi_t
        and gcry_sexp_t parameters. MPI data for that parameter is retrieved and the
        first byte of that data is tested, inserting an additional 0x00 byte at the
        beginning of the Vector if that first byte has the first bit set, avoiding this
        data accidentally being interpreted as a signed integer.

        No new tests -- related tests are now passing and are unskipped.

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Implement the SPKI import operation for RSA keys for platforms that use
        libgcrypt.

        The passed-in key data is decoded against the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` ASN.1
        structure. We then validate the `algorithm.algorithm` element, ensuring that
        the value under that represents a supported object identifier. This check is
        for now mostly superficial, only ensuring that the object identifier is either
        id-rsaEncryption, id-RSAES-OAEP or id-RSASSA-PSS. This has to be further extended
        to also check the id-sha{1,256,384,512}WithRSAEncryption identifiers as well as
        decoding the `algorithm.parameters` element against a specific ASN.1 structure,
        if necessary (RSASSA-PSS-params or RSAES-OAEP-params), and cross-checking the
        specified digest algorithm with the algorithm that's specified through the main
        object identifier or the structure contained in `algorithm.parameters`. This is
        avoided for now because no test in WebKit or the web-platform-tests suite covers
        this detail of the specification.

        After the algorithm is identified as supported, we proceed with decoding the
        `subjectPublicKey` data against the `RSAPublicKey` ASN.1 structure. From there,
        we retrieve the `modulus` and `publicExponent` data from which we can construct
        an RSA `public-key` s-expression that can be used through libgcrypt. A new
        CryptoKeyRSA object is then created, taking over ownership of the `public-key`
        s-expression, and returned.

        And r219332 caused the height of the widget to be calculated as
        the height of the button (16 pixels), which was incorrect as
        each button should be first expanded vertically to fit the

        on a new function spinButtonSize() that takes this into account,

        [GTK][WPE] border-radius with non visible border doesn't work on images that have their own RenderLayer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174157

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Do not allow direct compositing of images when they have a border-radius property on WebKitGTK+ and WPE.
        These platforms don't support clipping using rounded rectangles during composition, which is required
        when using border-radius and the border is not visible. Due to this, they need to perform the clippping
        with cairo.

        This is a temporal fix, until appropriate clipping is implemented in the TextureMapper.

        Paginated mode: Infinite recursion in RenderTable::layout
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174413

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch is a workaround for avoiding infinite recursion when the table layout does not stabilize.
        Apparently we leak some context (computed padding in this case) from the current to the subsequent layout.
        The subsequent layouts always end up producing different line heights for some of the cells in the <thead>.
        In paginated mode, when the section moves (<thead>, <tbody> etc) we call layout again recursively.
        This could lead to infinite recursion for unstable table layout.

        Unable to come up with a reduction yet.

        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyEC PKCS#8 exports
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173648

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Implement the PKCS#8 export operation for EC keys for platforms that use
        libgcrypt.

        First, the `ECParameters` and the `ECPrivateKey` ASN.1 structures are created
        and filled out accordingly. For the former, the appropriate object identifier
        is written under the `namedCurve` element of the structure. For the latter, we
        write out '1' under `version`, and eliminate the optional `parameters` element.
        An libgcrypt EC context is then used to retrieve the private and public key
        MPIs that are then written out under the `privateKey` and `publicKey` elements,
        respectively.

        After that, we can proceed to create and fill out the `PrivateKeyInfo` structure.
        0 is written out under the `version` element, and the id-ecPublicKey object
        identifier is written out under the `privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm` element. This
        doesn't strictly follow the specification, since the id-ecDH identifier should be
        used for ECDH keys, but no test in WebKit or the web-platform-tests suite covers
        this, so this specific detail should be revisited later.

        Data of the previously-constructed `ECParameters` structure is retrieved and
        written out under the `privateKeyAlgorithm.parameters` element. Similarly is done
        for the `ECPrivateKey` structure, writing out its data under the `privateKey`
        element. Finally, the optional `attributes` element of the `PrivateKeyInfo`
        structure is eliminated, and the encoded data of this structure is retrieved and
        returned.

        No new tests -- relevant tests are now passing and are unskipped.

        [WPE] Use libepoxy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172104

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        No new tests -- no changes in behavior.

        Implement the proper libepoxy header inclusion for ports that enable it.

        The library acts as a loading facility working on top of the system-provided
        OpenGL and EGL libraries, with the headers providing a complete collection of
        specification-defined OpenGL and EGL types, constants and entrypoints.

        Support is added through the USE(LIBEPOXY) build guard. Note that this guard
        isn't exclusive with USE(OPENGL), USE(OPENGL_ES_2) or USE(EGL), so the
        USE(LIBEPOXY) condition is tested before those.

        In case of OpenGL headers, the <epoxy/gl.h> header is included, and in
        case of EGL headers, the <epoxy/egl.h> header. <epoxy/egl.h> includes
        <epoxy/gl.h> on its own, so in some cases the inclusion of the latter is
        omitted.

        EpoxyShims.h header is added, doing a job similar to OpenGLESShims.h. The
        EXT-suffixed GL entrypoints are redefined to the non-suffixed versions.
        No suffixed constants are defined because those are defined by the libepoxy
        headers to the well-known values.

        ImageDecoder: Gifs with infinite animation only play once very often
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173403

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        It doesn't always happen, it's easier to reproduce when loading big files from the network, but it also depends
        on every file. The problem is that ImageFrameCache is caching the repetition count value always when the size is
        already available. In the case of gif files, the loop count value can be at any point of the image stream, so
        having the size available doesn't mean we also have the loop count. So, if the value is queried before it's
        available, the default value is cached (repeat once) and then always used. We should clear the cached value when
        new data is added to the decoder, like we do with other cached values that can change when more data is decoded.

        [WebIDL] Convert MutationCallback to be a normal generate callback
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174140

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        To make this work more nicely, I:
        - Added the ability to for non-nullable interfaces in sequences to be passed
          via a Ref<> rather than a RefPtr<> as a parameter to a callback function.
          (e.g. callback MyCallback = void (sequence<Foo> foos) will now have the 
          signature, CallbackResult<void> handleEvent(const Vector<Ref<Foo>>&) rather
          than CallbackResult<void> handleEvent(const Vector<RefPtr<Foo>>&).
        - Added a new extended attribute for callback functions called [CallbackNeedsCanInvoke]
          that adds a virtual function called canInvoke() to the generated callback.
          All it does is forward to ActiveDOMCallback's canInvokeCallback, but it
          allows the implementation to get to it. We may one day want to move the 
          inheritance of ActiveDOMCallback from the generated source to the base class.
        - Added a new extended attribute for callback functions called [CallbackThisObject=Type]
          which allows you to specify that the callback needs a this object in addition
          to its arguments. When specified, the first argument of the C++ implementation
          function will now correspond to the this object, with the remaining arguments
          shifted over one.

        [WK2 iOS] REGRESSION (r216803) During momentum scroll, getBoundingClientRect returns wrong coordinates (missing images on pinterest, elle.com and many other sites)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174286
        rdar://problem/32864180

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        r216803 made getBoundingClientRects relative to the layout viewport, but when scrolling we
        only update that on stable viewport updates (at the end of the scroll). This meant that during
        unstable updates, getBoundingClientRects() used a "frozen" viewport origin so things on-screen
        would appear to be off-screen, causing sites to fail to dynamically load images etc. when
        scrolling.

        Fix by pushing an optional "unstable" layout viewport rect onto FrameView, which gets used by
        FrameView::documentToClientOffset(). This is cleared when we do a stable update.

        This is a short-term solution. Longer term, I would prefer to always call setLayoutViewportOverrideRect(),
        but fix the scrolling tree logic to work correctly in this case.

        Add a bit more scrolling logging.

        Adding a source causes a selectMediaResource block to be enqueued.
        If dataLoadingPermitted prevents creating the m_player but sets the srcAttr, then
        the enqueued selectMediaResource will be in a bad state, with a srcAttr but no m_player.

        This fix prevents selectMediaResource from being called, if data loading is not permitted
        when adding a source element, to match how it prevents player creation when setting srcAttr.

        This fix also adds a debug assert to catch the problem earlier and adds an early return to

        Cleanup lifetime issues of UniqueIDBDatabase and IDBBackingStore.
        <rdar://problem/32908525> and https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174244

        Reviewed by David Kilzer and Alex Christensen. 

        No targeted test possible, implicitly covered by all IDB tests.

        The original idea behind UniqueIDBDatabase lifetime was that they are ThreadSafeRefCounted and
        we take protector Refs when any operation that needs it alive is in flight.
        
        This added variability to their lifetime which made it difficult to enforce a few different 
        design invariants, namely:
            - UniqueIBDDatabase objects are always created and destroyed only on the main thread.
            - IDBBackingStore objects are always created and destroyed only on the database thread.
        
        This patch removes the ref counting and instead ties UniqueIDBDatabase lifetime to a
        std::unique_ptr that is owned by the IDBServer.
        
        Whenever any operations on the UniqueIDBDatabase are in flight it is kept alive by virtue
        of that unique_ptr in the IDBServer. Once a UniqueIDBDatabase is completely done with all of
        its work, the following happens:
            - On the main thread the IDBServer removes the unique_ptr owning the UniqueIDBDatabase
              from its map.
            - It hands the unique_ptr to the UniqueIDBDatabase itself, which schedules one final 
              database thread task.
            - That database thread task is to destroy the IDBBackingStore, kill its message queues,
              and then message back to the main thread for one final task.
            - That main thread task is to release the unique_ptr, resulting in destruction of the
              UniqueIDBDatabase object.
        
        This is safe, predictable, solves the lifetime issues that r218516 originally tried to solve,
        and solves the lifetime issues that r218516 introduced.

        (This patch also adds many more assertions to cover various design invariants throughout the
        lifecycle of a particular UniqueIDBDatabase)

        we should ignore fallback entires whose fallback namespace URL is not prefixed with

        <rdar://problem/32083177>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Currently, in DragController.cpp, defaultOperationForDrag maps a drag source operation mask of
        DragOperationGeneric to DragOperationMove across all platforms. However, on iOS, where cross-app drag moves do
        not trigger a drop, this means drop handlers won't fire unless the dropEffect is explicitly set to copy.

        To fix this, we introduce DragController::platformGenericDragOperation(), which returns DragOperationCopy on iOS
        and DragOperationMove (the existing behavior) elsewhere. defaultOperationForDrag then maps a drag source
        operation mask of DragOperationGeneric to platformGenericDragOperation().

        [SVG] Leak in SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172545

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff maintains a vector m_wrappers with references to
        SVGPropertyTraits<PropertyType>::ListItemTearOff. Apart from that SVGPropertyTearOff has a
        reference to SVGAnimatedProperty.

        When SVGListProperty::getItemValuesAndWrappers() is called, it creates a
        SVGPropertyTraits<PropertyType>::ListItemTearOff pointing to the same SVGAnimatedProperty (a
        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff) which stores the m_wrappers vector where the ListItemTearOff
        is going to be added to. This effectively creates a reference cycle between the
        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff and all the ListItemTearOff it stores in m_wrappers.

        We should detach those wrappers in propertyWillBeDeleted() in order to break the cycle.

        [GStreamer] vid.me videos do not play
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172240

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        In r142251, code to hide the WK HTTP source elements from elsewhere in
        the pipeline was removed. This has the nasty side-effect of
        auto-plugging the WK HTTP source into things it really should not be
        used in, especially the adaptive streaming demuxers. The reasons this
        is bad are documented in several places on Bugzilla, see the parent
        bug report for more details. The high-level issue is that the WK HTTP
        source and its use of WebCore is not thread-safe. Although work has
        been recently done to improve this situation, it's still not perfect.

        Another issue is the interface hlsdemux expects its HTTP source to
        implement, specifically seeking in READY.

        This does rely on HTTP context sharing being available in GStreamer,
        upstream bug is here:
        https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761099. The failing case
        can be demonstrated with
        https://github.com/thiagoss/adaptive-test-server but manual testing on
        popular video hosting sites, including vid.me, shows that this doesn't
        bite us at the moment, just something else to fix in the future.

        There are some QoS issues with the adaptive streaming code in
        GStreamer, but it seems much better to offer a below par QoS in lieu
        of crashing/livelocking when playing certain streams, and issues can be
        raised upstream when they arise.

        This patch does take us further away from the future goal of having all
        networking operations go through the network process, but in return it
        solves some nasty crashes and livelocks that have been irritating
        users for some time. With the pressure off on this issue, work can be
        planned to consider how to make the WK HTTP source a better citizen
        inside the GStreamer pipeline when we migrate the netcode to go
        through the network process.

        A new test is added to check that the single file HLS playlists
        (new in version 4) can be played, which was the primary cause of
        this bug report.

        schemas.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::load): Refactor to use the
        setPlaybinURL helper method.
        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::loadNextLocation): Ditto.
        * platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.h: Add
        the setPlaybinURL helper method.

        (webKitWebSrcGetProtocols): Only advertise webkit+https?, this
        ensures we won't get auto-plugged by pipeline elements asking for
        an element to fetch https? resources (like adaptive demuxers).
        (convertPlaybinURI): Undo the trick when another element asks us
        for our URI.

        REGRESSION(r216944): Font loads can cause Chinese characters to draw as .notdef
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173962
        <rdar://problem/32925318>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Previously, there was no signalling between our font loading code
        which determined whether or not a font should be invisible (because
        its in the middle of loading) and our system fallback code which
        created fonts when we fall off the end of the fallback list. Because
        of this, we were doing two things wrong:

        1. When we started downloading a font, we would try to use a fallback
        font. However, if the fallback font didn't suppor the character we're
        trying to render, we would just bail and draw .notdef
        2. Even if we continued down the fallback list, and fell of the end,
        we wouldn't realize that the system fallback font should also be drawn
        as invisible.

        This patch solves these two problems by:
        1. Performing a search to find the best (local) fallback font with
        which to fall systemFallbackFontForCharacter(). This way, if you say
        "font-family: 'RemoteFont', 'Helvetica'" we will use Helvetica as
        the lookup to ask the system to search for.
        2. Give the Font class an accessor which can create a duplicate, but
        invisible font. Give FontCascadeFonts::glyphDataForVariant() the
        correct tracking to know when to use this invisible duplicate.

        [GStreamer] vid.me videos do not play
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172240

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        In r142251, code to hide the WK HTTP source elements from elsewhere in
        the pipeline was removed. This has the nasty side-effect of
        auto-plugging the WK HTTP source into things it really should not be
        used in, especially the adaptive streaming demuxers. The reasons this
        is bad are documented in several places on Bugzilla, see the parent
        bug report for more details. The high-level issue is that the WK HTTP
        source and its use of WebCore is not thread-safe. Although work has
        been recently done to improve this situation, it's still not perfect.

        Another issue is the interface hlsdemux expects its HTTP source to
        implement, specifically seeking in READY.

        This does rely on HTTP context sharing being available in GStreamer,
        upstream bug is here:
        https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761099. The failing case
        can be demonstrated with
        https://github.com/thiagoss/adaptive-test-server but manual testing on
        popular video hosting sites, including vid.me, shows that this doesn't
        bite us at the moment, just something else to fix in the future.

        There are some QoS issues with the adaptive streaming code in
        GStreamer, but it seems much better to offer a below par QoS in lieu
        of crashing/livelocking when playing certain streams, and issues can be
        raised upstream when they arise.

        This patch does take us further away from the future goal of having all
        networking operations go through the network process, but in return it
        solves some nasty crashes and livelocks that have been irritating
        users for some time. With the pressure off on this issue, work can be
        planned to consider how to make the WK HTTP source a better citizen
        inside the GStreamer pipeline when we migrate the netcode to go
        through the network process.

        A new test is added to check that the single file HLS playlists
        (new in version 4) can be played, which was the primary cause of
        this bug report.

        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff maintains a vector m_wrappers with references to

        reference to SVGAnimatedProperty.

        When SVGListProperty::getItemValuesAndWrappers() is called, it creates a
        SVGPropertyTraits<PropertyType>::ListItemTearOff pointing to the same SVGAnimatedProperty (a
        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff) which stores the m_wrappers vector where the ListItemTearOff
        is going to be added to. This effectively creates a reference cycle between the
        SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff and all the ListItemTearOff it stores in m_wrappers.

        We should detach those wrappers in propertyWillBeDeleted() in order to break the cycle.

        REGRESSION: Stack overflow in RenderBlockFlow::layoutBlock after increasing the font size to max in some RTL vertical books.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174144
        <rdar://problem/32781038>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We set the start/end margin on the ruby renderer to support overhanging content. The margins ensure that
        adjacent boxes on the line are placed properly respecting the overhanging content.
        The line breaking algorithm also takes this value into account as it affects the line's available width.
        We need to reset this value before laying out the lines, otherwise we might end up using this value on the line twice;
        first as the renderer's margins (as the result of the previous layout) and second as the renderer's overhanging value.
        Since this is not strictly part of the renderer's layout context (i.e. we set them during the line layout and not at
        RenderRubyRun::layout) we can't rely on the ruby's layout logic to reset them.

        WTF::Thread should have the threads stack bounds.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173975

        Reviewed by Keith Miller.

        When creating WebThread, we first allocate WebCore::ThreadGlobalData in UI thread
        and share it with WebThread.
        The problem is that WebCore::ThreadGlobalData has CachedResourceRequestInitiators.
        It allocates AtomicString, which requires WTFThreadData.

        Before this patch, it was OK because WTFThreadData does not touch threading related
        things except for ThreadSpecific<>. However, after this patch, it touches
        WTF::Thread::current() which requires WTF::initializeThreading().

        In this patch, we call WTF::initializeThreading() before allocating WebCore::ThreadGlobalData.
        And we also call AtomicString::init() before calling WebCore::ThreadGlobalData since
        WebCore::ThreadGlobalData allocates AtomicString.

        This fixes crashes in the iOS web threading environment (UIWebView).

        Currenly, if the page clears the current selection after dragging starts on selected content, the web process
        will crash while attempting to write pasteboard data for a nonexistent selection. This patch adds a trivial
        check for this case, bailing if no DHTML dragging data was specified by the page during a selection drag and the
        selection has been cleared.

        Also removes some unused code for estimating the bounds of the current selection. On iOS, dragging was actually
        crashing earlier, in this codepath. However, this information isn't even used anymore, since the drag anchor
        point is no longer necessary on iOS.

        Patch mostly by Myles.

        When we receive a low memory warning, we clear the style resolver. Previously, we were using
        this as an opportunity to also purge the CSSFontSelector. However, purging the font selector
        is wasteful, since the exact same set of CSSFontFace objects will be recreated as soon as the
        CSSFontSelector is recreated. It's also harmful because this purge operation causes fonts to
        be removed from the document's working set, and therefore triggers a relayout. Instead, this
        call should be softened to only delete any transitory caches the CSSFontSelector owns.

        We can simply delay the rebuild of the CSSFontSelector to
        StyleResolver::appendAuthorStyleSheets(), when it's really needed. This way, we can sidestep
        this whole problem.

        There's also an added benefit: Now, buildStarted() doesn't have to be idempotent, so we can
        enforce a stricter calling sequence with ASSERT()s.

        Renderer logicalWidth should be set by layout. Direct override by RenderView when printing means

        Because Skia is a variation font, its PostScript name contains values to apply to its variation
        axes. However, WebKit's variation code was overwriting these intrinsive values with ones specified
        by CSS. Therefore, the intrinsic ones were being ignored. The solution is just to pass a flag from
        the lookup code to the variations code describing if the font was created via a PostScript name,
        and to not apply the CSS properties to it if it was.

        Pasting single words copied to UIPasteboard inserts URLs in editable areas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174082
        <rdar://problem/33046992>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, our heuristics for coercing plain text to URLs when reading URLs off of the UIPasteboard allows URLs
        to be created as long as -[UIPasteboard valuesForPasteboardType:inItemSet:] returns a non-null NSURL. However,
        UIPasteboard automatically coerces any NSString into an NSURL if it initializes an NSURL via +URLWithString:.
        Thus, single-word strings such as "hello" that are written to the pasteboard as "public.utf8-plain-text" can
        be read back as NSURLs for "public.url". This currently causes bugs in shipping software: e.g. copying and
        pasting a single word from an editable input or textarea and pasting into a rich contenteditable area using
        WebKit1 inserts a link. However, when combined with another change in WebKit that attempts to read "public.url"
        before "public.text" when reading plain text from the pasteboard, this now also affects pasting in plain text
        areas, where pasted plain-text strings that are not URLs will paste as URL-encoded strings anyways (for
        instance, replacing "[hello]" with "%5Bhello%5D").

        To fix this, and existing issues with pasting single words in contenteditables, we make
        PlatformPasteboard::readString and PlatformPasteboard::readURL only accept a coerced NSURL as an URL if it also
        parses as a valid URL in WebKit (otherwise, we return an empty string).

        Tests:
            UIPasteboardTests.DoNotPastePlainTextAsURL

        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyEC SPKI exports
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173646

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        No new tests -- affected tests are now passing and are unskipped.

        Implement libgcrypt-based support for SPKI exports of EC keys.

        Initially, the ECParameters structure is created so that it will be later embedded
        into the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure. First the root element of this structure
        is written into, specifying namedCurve as the chosen member (even if other choices
        are not really available). We then write out the object identifier into this
        namedCurve member that properly represents this key's curve type.

        The SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure is created next. We write out id-ecPublicKey
        identifier as the chosen algorithm identifier. Web Crypto specification demands
        that the id-ecDH identifier is used in case of ECDH keys, but no existing test in
        the W3C test suite expects this, so this should be revisited later. Data of the
        previously-constructed ECParameters structure is written out into the
        AlgorithmIdentifier's parameters member.

        The `q` MPI data is then retrieved. Its size is validated, as well as the first
        byte of data in order to ensure the MPI represents an uncompressed EC point.
        The data is then written into the subjectPublicKey member.

        Finally the encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure data is extracted and returned
        from the platformExportSpki() function, completion the export operation.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173617
        <rdar://problem/32969819>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        On systems where USE_PLATFORM_SYSTEM_FALLBACK_LIST is set to true, the code in
        platformFontWithFamilySpecialCase() is still used when @font-face blocks specify
        src:local(system-ui), which made the assertion erroneously fire.

        Unfortunately, our architecture is such that an @font-face block represents a
        single entry in the font-family fallback list, which means it would be quite
        difficult to make local(system-ui) in an @font-face block expand at the level
        of the font cascade. So, this patch simply reverts to the previous behavior for
        local(system-ui) (which doesn't include the entire Core Text cascade list).
        This means that "font-family: system-ui" and "src: local(system-ui)" have
        different behavior, which is undesirable, but architecturally difficult to
        solve. I've added some FIXMEs to the code in the relevant places and filed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174023.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, TextIndicatorOptionUseBoundingRectAndPaintAllContentForComplexRanges ensures that links backed by a
        RenderReplaced element don't render blank text indicators by additionally forcing the
        TextIndicatorOptionPaintAllContent option in order to capture the RenderReplaced content. If estimated
        background color is requested, this patch adds an additional path for "upgrading" the text indicator to paint
        all content: if the text color is not legible against the estimated background color, then it is likely that the
        background color estimate failed or the link itself was not legible in the first place; in the former case, to
        ensure that the link is still legible, we upgrade the given TextIndicatorOptions to paint all contents in the
        range.

        There is currently no way to test this, and also no simple way to introduce infrastructure to test text
        indicators.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174016

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The bug was caused by WebKit allowing the opening of a new window via window.open but disallowing
        the initial navigation within the newly opened window while a beforeunload event is being dispatched.

        Because some websites which opens a window during a beforeunload event relies on the opened page
        to communicate back in order to close it. This resulted in a newly opened popup window with about:blank
        being left out on those websites.

        Fixed the bug by allowing the navigation of a new window as well as an existing another window.
        More concretely, we disallow navigations within the same frame tree as the one in which a beforeunload
        event is being dispatched, and allow navigations elsewhere (i.e. different window / page).
        During the destruction of a frame-less document, disallow all the navigations.

        [iOS DnD] Drag caret rect is incorrectly computed when dropping in editable content in iframes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174017
        <rdar://problem/32959782>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We're currenly computing the drag caret rect (for the purposes of presentation at the client layers)
        incorrectly, in per-frame document coordinates instead of root view coordinates in the mainframe. This means
        drag caret geometry from embedded iframes in the document will show up in the content view with a rect in the
        coordinate space of the iframe.

        To fix this, we need to convert the drag caret rect to root view coordinates. This patch teaches
        DragCaretController to do this, and tweaks WebKit/WebKit2 to use caretRectInRootViewCoordinates.

       Updated test is showing some more failing but this is due to the fact that we are no longer totally lying on the configuration of the
        underlying libwebrtc backend.

        Previously, we were creating a libwebrtc peer connection and then setting its configuration.
        libwebrtc does not like the configuration to be changed and may refuse to set the configuration.
        Instead of doing that, we are now creating the libwebrtc peer connection with the provided configuration.

        ICE candidate pool size is disabled as it is creating issues with running tests on bots.

        The layout viewport returned by FrameView::layoutViewportRect() is affected by page (Command-+) zooming,
        since it's computed using scroll positions, so when we use its origin to convert into client coordinates
        (which are zoom-agnostic), we need to account for page zoom, so fix FrameView::documentToClientOffset()
        to do this.

        Callers of documentToClientOffset() were checked, revealing that event client coordinates were also
        wrong with page zoom and are fixed in the same way. It was found that SimulatedClick was using an
        entirely wrong rect to compute its location: Element::clientRect() is NOT in client coordinates,
        so change this code to use getBoundingClientRect() instead.

        Minor refactoring in MouseRelatedEvent to make getting to the FrameView cleaner.

        [WebIDL] Add a new extended attribute to model the forced return value optimization used on Node and Crypto
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173961

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Node and Crypto were both using custom bindings to implement an optimization
        for operations that always returned one one of the arguments passed in. The
        optimization directly returns the JSValue argument, avoiding wrapping and 
        unwrapping, and all the cache lookups that might entail. This allows that 
        optimization to work without custom bindings by adding a new extended attribute
        [ReturnValue] that can annotate an argument. When used, the implementation
        function is expected to return either void or ExceptionOr<void>.

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        The problem is that WebPageProxy::getLoadDecisionForIcon() sends 0 as callback ID when the decision is to not
        load the icon. Since r218896 we always notify the client even when the decision is to not load the icon, in
        which case the UI doesn't really expect a callback. When WebPageProxy::dataCallback is called with a 0 callback ID,
        CallbackMap::take() crashes in RELEASE_ASSERT(callbackID).

        This does the basic separation of eval-blocked and
        WebAssembly-blocked, but currently only blocks neither or both. I
        think we'll eventually consider allowing one to be blocked but not
        the other, so this separation makes sense and means that when we
        want to do the change it'll be tiny. At a minimum we want a
        different error message, which this patch provides (a lot of the
        code ties blocking to the error message).

        There are two types of font formats which support features: AAT and OTF. Each of them has
        a different idea about what the identity of a feature is. We were specifying both types
        of feature identities to Core Text; however, this is causing Core Text to get confused.
        Instead, we should only apply AAT features to AAT fonts and OTF features to OTF fonts.

        The crashed is most likely caused by updateLayersAfterAncestorChange calling [CALayer setPosition]

        Safari's Speedometer score massively regresses when accessibility is enabled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173912

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        The bug was caused by HTMLTextFormControlElement::setInnerTextValue triggering a synchronous layout
        via constructing VisiblePosition when the accessibility tree is present.

        Added AXObjectCache::postTextReplacementNotificationForTextControl which avoids the construction of
        VisiblePosition and other means of triggering a synchronous layout. This patch also fixes a subtle bug
        that HTMLTextFormControlElement was creating TextMarkerData with axID set to that of the text control
        element instead of the root editable element inside its shadow tree even though the typing command uses
        axID of the root editable element. While I couldn't find any user-visible behavioral change from this
        code change, new code is more self-consistent.

        Also added LayoutDisallowedScope which asserts that no synchronous layout happens in setInnerTextValue
        so that we don't introduce a new performance regression like this in the future.

        No new tests. Existing tests in accessibility directory covers this.

        [GTK] Some web pages disappear immediately after rendering
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173768

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        This is happening with websites having a "hidden" class in HTML tag when a media element is added. In the GTK+
        port the media controls CSS contains the following code:

        .hidden {
            display: none !important;
        }

        That causes the whole HTML document to become display: none. That's why we just render a white page, and also
        the reason why it only happens with the GTK+ port and only with some specific websites. We should limit the
        scope of the hidden class to the media control elements.

        <rdar://problem/32236827>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa and Tim Horton.

        Allows elements to be dragged from contenteditable areas for both WebKit1 and WebKit2 iOS. There are two main
        changes in WebCore: move the touch point adjustment code into EventHandler::tryToBeginDataInteractionAtPoint, so
        that the clientPosition specified will be adjusted to an appropriate clickable node if needed. This is necessary
        because UIWebDocumentView and WKContentView no longer send adjusted points to WebCore when requesting drag
        start. See <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173855> for a followup regarding the globalPosition and
        clientPositions passed in to the MouseEvents when performing a drag or synthetic click.

        Secondly, image elements in Mail's contenteditable area are not draggable unless the heuristic in
        DragController::draggableElement is tweaked to not reject image dragging across the board if the
        loadsImagesAutomatically setting is turned off. Instead, even if images are not automatically loaded, allow the
        image drag to commence if the image renderer already has a cached image.

        When under memory pressure MemoryCache::singleton().pruneLiveResources(true) is called inFrameView::didPaintContents()
        after top level paint. We end up decoding and pruning bitmaps repeatedly for each tile, which is not great.

        Situation gets worse with async decoding. Painting now doesn’t actually decode the image, it just starts the decoding.
        When it completes we trigger another paint to get the bits to the tiles. The paint for the first tile then calls
        pruneLiveResources and loses the bitmap and the second tile triggers another round of async decoding. We have code
        that prevents pruning of visible images but non-visible images in tiling area can hit this bug easily.

          parseReadOnlyMembers up into parseInterfaceMember to make it clearer that they are top level members
          and match the grammar.
        - Rename parseAttributeOrOperationOrIterator to parseOperationOrReadWriteAttributeOrMaplike to match the
          grammar language and make it clear what it does.
        - Add parseAttributeOrOperationForStringifierOrStatic which contains most of the logic for parsing stringifiers
          and static members, which have almost identical grammars.
        - Remove creator special which no longer exists in the spec.

        <rdar://problem/32940942>

        Reviewed by Mark Lam.

        The crash was happening because the WebLowPowerModeObserver would dispatch
        a lambda to the main thread but the LowPowerModeNotifier object could be
        dead by the time we get to the main thread.

        To address the issue, keep a strong ref to the WebLowPowerModeObserver in
        the lambda we dispatch to the main thread to make sure it stays alive until
        we execute the lambda. In the LowPowerModeNotifier destructor, we now reset
        the WebLowPowerModeObserver's notifier pointer to nil and I added a null
        check for this notifier in the lambda.

        Stop registering the AES-CFB algorithm as something that's supported by
        the libgcrypt implementation. This algorithm was previously included in
        the Web Crypto API specification, but has since been dropped from it.

        Conveniently, libgcrypt only recently gained support for the CFB8 AES
        cipher mode that's required by the specification, meaning we could only
        support this algorithm with future releases of the libgcrypt library.

        @font-face rules with invalid primary fonts never download their secondary fonts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173138
        <rdar://problem/32554450>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We have logic in CSSFontAccessor::font() which disallows downloading a CSSFontFace if that CSSFontFace
        is already in the Succeeded state. However, it was possible for a succeeded CSSFontFace to still fail
        to create a font. In this situation, we wouldn't be able to use the downloaded font, and we wouldn't
        try to download the next item in the src: list because the CSSFontFace is succeeded.

        This patch strengthens the meaning of the Succeeded state. Previously, it just meant that the bytes
        in the file were downloaded successfully. This patch extends this to also mean that the bytes in the
        file can be successfully interpreted as a font. This way, the CSSFontFace in the example above won't be
        set to the Succeeded state, so we will continue follow the src: list and download the secondary fonts.

        This has an added benefit that the CSS Font Loading API's promises will be called more appropriately.
        The transition to the Succeeded state will trigger a resolve of the promise. Now, these promises will
        only be resolved if the fonts are actually parsed and understood by our text system.

        Test: fast/text/font-fallback-invalid-load.html

        * css/CSSFontFaceSource.cpp:
        (WebCore::CSSFontFaceSource::fontLoaded): Move to the failed state if we can't understand the font
        data. This is the crux of this patch.
        (WebCore::CSSFontFaceSource::font): This function should only be called if we are in the Succeeded
        state, which means now we know we should always be able to understand the bytes of the file. Therefore,
        we can change some if statements into ASSERT()s.
        * loader/cache/CachedSVGFont.cpp:
        (WebCore::CachedSVGFont::createFont): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CachedSVGFont::ensureCustomFontData): Similarly to CSSFontFaceSource::fontLoaded(), this
        adds another check to our criteria for transitioning into the Succeeded state, which will guarantee that
        later we will always be able to create the font object.

        A FrameLoadRequest groups together the information to perform a load into a single object
        that is more manageable to pass around than its constituent parts. Code that receives a
        FrameLoadRequest is expected to extract out the information it needs to complete its task.
        And it does not make sense to re-use the same FrameLoadRequest object for more than one
        load. Therefore, it is sufficient to make FrameLoadRequest a move-only type.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        We have a longstanding issue that some media/modern-media-controls tests time out due to
        requestAnimationFrame callbacks not being serviced, which is tracked by webkit.org/b/173628.
        We added some logging to identify when ScriptedAnimationController would get suspended in
        webkit.org/b/173326. This logging points to the fact that the reason rAF callbacks aren't
        serviced is because Document::requestAnimationFrame() suspends rAF when the page reports
        that scripted animations ought to be suspended, which is true when m_scriptedAnimationsSuspended
        is true. This patch adds logging that tracks when this flag is set, provided a new setting

        Implement libgcrypt-based support for SPKI imports of EC keys.

        Using libtasn1 through the utility functions and wrappers, the given key data
        is decoded against the SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 definition. The algorithm
        member is then properly validated, making sure that the key algorithm idenfitier
        is supported and that the algorithm parameters specify the correct EC curve.

        The public key bit string is then retrieved and validated, ensuring it represents
        an uncompressed EC point that is of valid size for the specified EC curve. The
        point is then tested through an EC context to make sure it's positioned on the
        specified EC curve.

        Finally, the curve name and uncompressed point data are embedded into a
        `public-key` s-expression that will be used through the libgcrypt API. This is
        then used, along with other information, to create a valid CryptoKeyEC object.

        Media document experience with long-loading files is poor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173575
        <rdar://problem/32178119>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        In order to avoid showing media controls at a different size than that of the video when we've
        received enough information to determine whether it's audio or video and what the video frame size
        is, we do not show any UI until we have enough information to show the controls in their correct
        initial state. This works well with local files and fast-loading files, but does not work well with
        invalid files, which never load and fail to ever show any UI, and files that load slowly where there
        is no visible feedback that content will be visible.

        Instead, we now default to showing audio controls in their loading state, which provides a seamless
        transition if we will be loading an audio file since the controls are initially in the correct state,
        and at least provide feedback that data is loading even if we eventually transition to a video layout.

        Additionally, we remove the invalid placard background in case the media is invalid, showing only the
        crossed-out play icon in the center of the page in that state.

        NavigationAction has too many constructors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173484

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        A NavigationAction object is an immutable object that represents the details of a
        navigation, including the type of a navigation (e.g. link click), what triggered
        the navigation, and the external URL policy to use for the navigation. Over time
        the number of NavigationAction constructor overloads (not including copy/move
        constructors) has grown to 12 to support different combinations of details.
        We can use default values to reduce the number of constructors to 2 (not including
        copy/move constructors).

        No behavior changed. So, no new tests.

        (WebCore::FrameLoader::continueLoadAfterNewWindowPolicy): Pass NavigationType::Other when
        instantiating NavigationAction.

        the constructor overload that takes a NavigationType takes the Event* as the fourth argument,

        can be used from WebKit on the Apple Windows port. Move ShouldOpenExternalURLsPolicy to be after

        value used when no rotation needs to be performed, and it's currently triggering an assertion.

        [iOS] Always include frames in the scrolling tree when async frame scrolling is enabled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173405

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Currently "async frame scrolling" is ignored on iOS. This commit changes that behavior to
        align on macOS and is a preliminary step to implement iframe scrolling on iOS (bug 149264).

        [Mac] Add an experimental feature setting for async frame scrolling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173359

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The necessary work to use compositing for frames and include them in the scrolling tree on
        macOS was performed in r217726 and r217730. ScrollingTreeIncludesFrames was used to
        determine when this behavior should be enabled. However, this does not work well on iOS where
        ScrollingTreeIncludesFrames defaults to true and really means "include the frames in the
        scrolling tree when necessary". Hence we instead introduce a new "async frame scrolling"
        switch to enable the behavior on macOS, which will also be used in a follow-up commit on iOS.
        This new setting is also made an "experimental feature", so that it will be more convenient
        for developer to try it.

        <rdar://problem/31418761> and https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173473

        No new tests (No known change in behavior)

        I discovered the need to make these changes here due to a transient bug
        introduced in r218015 but already explicitly fixed in r218409.
        
        This change adds an assert to guard against a detached DocumentLoader having active IconLoaders.

        It also clears out all pending IconLoader and icon load decisions when stopLoading() is called, 
        as even attempting to start an icon load after detachment is a waste of cycles.
        
        * loader/DocumentLoader.cpp:
        (WebCore::DocumentLoader::stopLoading): Also explicitly clear all IconLoaders and icons pending
          load decision.
        (WebCore::DocumentLoader::finishedLoadingIcon): Assert that this DocumentLoader is not detached.

        [WebIDL] Properly model buffer source / typed arrays as their own IDL types

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        - Adds IDL type hierarchy for buffer source types.
        - Includes a special type, IDLArrayBufferView, which WebIDL defines as the union
          of DataView and all the typed array types, but we model as shared base class.
          This should not be observable, and allows us to avoid using a Variant for ArrayBufferView
          and instead use the existing base class.
        - Add builtin typedefs for BufferSource and DOMTimeStamp as defined in WebIDL. As noted
          above, rather than define a typedef of ArrayBufferView that maps to a union, we treat
          it as a special type.

        * bindings/IDLTypes.h:

        - IDLBufferSource is the root

        - And then the specific typed array types derive from IDLTypedArray, and are defined
          in JSDOMConvertBufferSource so we don't have to include a ton of typed array includes

        [GCrypt] AES_CTR support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171420

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Implement AES_CTR support for build configurations that use libgcrypt.

        Both encryption and decryption operations are handled in a single gcryptAES_CTR() function,
        with the specific operation being passed as the first argument. The appropriate AES
        algorithm is picked, and a gcry_cipher_hd_t object is created and has the given key set.
        This key will remain the same throughout the gcry_cipher_hd_t lifetime, even after
        gcry_cipher_reset() calls.

        The encrypt/decrypt operation is wrapped into a helper lambda functor that accepts the
        given counter and input data. It resets the cipher object, sets the counter data, and
        performs the specified operation, returning the output data.

        libgcrypt doesn't support setting counter data on a gcry_cipher_hd_t object with only
        part of that data being used as the actual counter, with the rest acting as a nonce, like
        the Web Crypto specification allows. We have to implement the support for that on our own.

        We compute the number of blocks we'll be processing and the upper exclusive limit for the
        given counter length. We immediately bail if the counter limit is less than the computed
        block count, since that would mean that the counter values would be repeated.

        We short-cut to a direct operation call if the counter length matches size of the counter
        data -- we don't have to adjust the counter data in any way if that's the case.

        Otherwise we move counter data into the MPI format. The nonce and the actual counter MPIs
        can split out of the counter data MPI with the modulus operation and the counter limit MPI.

        We take another shortcut straight to the operation call if we're able to determine that the
        'counter leeway' value, i.e. the difference between the initial counter MPI and the counter
        limit MPI, is larger or equal to the predicted block size -- if that's the case, the counter
        won't wrap around and change the nonce data.

        In worst-case scenario the counter data will wrap around and we have to address that. The
        current implementation takes the slowest possible path for the moment, encrypting/decrypting
        each block separately. For each step the counter is combined with the nonce, the resulting
        MPI data retrieved and passed to the operation function, and the returned block output
        appended to the final output vector. The counter MPI is then incremented and ran through the
        modulus operation, limiting the MPI value to the previously-computed counter limit.

        No new tests -- relevant tests are passing and are unskipped.

        Add heuristic to avoid flattening "fullscreen" iframes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171914

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Some authors implement fullscreen popups as out-of-flow iframes with size set to full viewport (using vw/vh CSS units).
        When iframe flattening is enabled, such iframes may unexpectedly become larger than the viewport.
        This commit adds a simple heuristic to avoid frame flattening in that case.
        It is experimented by introducing a "enable for non-fullscreen iframes" state for the frame
        flattening setting.
        The default frame flattening is still either disabled or (fully) enabled on all platforms.
        InternalSettings is also adjusted so that the tests can still set the frame flattening setting.

        Crash when re-entering MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::cancel()

        <rdar://problem/31185739>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When a MediaDevicesRequest is started, it creates a MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest
        object and passes a completion handler to that MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest
        object. The completion handler holds a reference to the MediaDevicesRequest object
        so that its stays alive until the MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest either completes
        or is canceled. MediaDevicesRequest also holds a reference to the
        MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest object via its m_enumerationRequest data member.

        When the document is destroyed, both MediaDevicesRequest::contextDestroyed() and
        MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::contextDestroyed() gets called and the other is not
        pre-determined. If MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::contextDestroyed() gets called
        first then it calls MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::cancel(). Calling cancel() ends
        up destroying the completion handler. Destroying the completion handler ends up
        dereferencing and destroying the MediaDevicesRequest object. The MediaDevicesRequest
        destructor would call MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::cancel() again, causing us to
        re-enter it and assign nullptr to the completion callback again. Re-entering
        std::function's operator=(nullptr_t) is not safe because of the way it is implemented
        as we end up trying to destroy the lambda twice and crashing. Using a WTF::Function
        instead fixes this particular issue because re-entering WTF::Function's operator=(nullptr_t)
        is safe.

        However, this fix is not sufficient. Calling the MediaDevicesRequest destructor also
        dereferencing and destroys the MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest object. As a result,
        when MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::contextDestroyed() returns from its call to cancel
        |this| is already dead when we call ContextDestructionObserver::contextDestroyed().
        To address this issue, we now protect |this| in MediaDevicesEnumerationRequest::contextDestroyed().

        [MSE] Seeking or entering fullscreen can cause extreme CPU usage
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173505

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When support for painting MSE to WebGL was added in r217185, the implementation of
        SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::isReadyForMoreSamples() was modified to support asking
        the decompression session if it was ready. That change, however, caused an extreme
        performance regression in the normal playback path, where WebKit will effectively
        append samples endlessly to the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer, which admirably enqueued
        each of them for decoding. Eventually, the cost of iterating over the CMBufferQueue
        overwhelmed the cost of decoding, and caused the extreme lag seen when seeking.

        Make sure to property query the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer for isReadyForMoreMediaData
        before enqueuing.

        A previous version of this patch exposed some errors which caused failing tests:

        In sourceBufferPrivateDidReceiveSample(), we were using local versions of
        presentationTimestamp and decodeTimestamp as keys to the decodeQueue; those local versions
        were floating point values (because MediaTime + float = float), but the sample itself uses
        non-floating point MediaTimes. This causes samples to be left in the queue when they should
        be removed.

        In didBecomeReadyForMoreSamples(), we were getting spurious assertions when a
        AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer or a AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer would fire a callback from
        -requestMediaDataWhenReadyOnQueue:usingBlock: even after it had been told to
        -stopRequestingMediaData. Apparently it's expected behavior and so an ASSERT_NOT_REACHED is
        inappropriate here.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The bug was caused by WebKit wrapping CSS string values with single quotation marks instead of
        double quotation marks as spec'ed in https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#serialize-a-string and
        implemented in Firefox and Chrome.

        The website eval's the computed value of the `content` CSS property with the value `'{name: "flat"}'`
        after stripping single quotation marks from both ends. Prior to r209495, WebKit serialized this CSS value
        in single quotations without escaping double quotations. After r209495, double quotations are escaped
        with backslashes as `'{name: \"flat\"}'`. As a result, `eval` is invoked with `{name: \"flat\"}`
        after stripping single quotations from both ends, which resulted in an exception.

        Chrome and Firefox don't encounter this exception despite of the fact they escape double quotations
        as well because serialize with double quotations as `"{name: \"flat\"}"`. Because there is no code
        to strip double quotations, eval is invoked with the same string, resulting in the entire value as
        being parsed as string, instead of an object with a single key "name" with the value of "flat" as
        was the case in WebKit prior to r209495. While this behavior was most certainly not the intent of
        the website author, Chrome and Firefox don't encounter an exception and the website continues to work.

        This patch aligns WebKit's behavior to that of the CSS OM specification, Firefox, and Chrome by
        serializing CSS string values using double quotation marks instead of single quotation marks.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When support for painting MSE to WebGL was added in r217185, the implementation of
        SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::isReadyForMoreSamples() was modified to support asking
        the decompression session if it was ready. That change, however, caused an extreme
        performance regression in the normal playback path, where WebKit will effectively
        append samples endlessly to the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer, which admirably enqueued
        each of them for decoding. Eventually, the cost of iterating over the CMBufferQueue
        overwhelmed the cost of decoding, and caused the extreme lag seen when seeking.

        Make sure to property query the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer for isReadyForMoreMediaData
        before enqueuing.

        API Test: Tests/WebKit2/MediaStreamTrackDetached.mm

        Move the definition of a MediaStream as a MediaProducer from the stream itself to its constituent
        MediaStreamTracks. This ensures that, even if a MediaStreamTrack is removed from its stream, the
        document (and thus the clients) are notified that media capture is still occurring.

        Though MediaStream is no longer a MediaProducer, it still uses the MediaProducer's state concept
        to determine when to fire events. However it's mediaState() implementation will be moved into
        MediaStreamTrack, and will instead simply bitwise-or together each of it's track's mediaState().

        The MediaStream notifies the document that its state has changed asynchronously, so do the same
        for MediaStreamTrack (which reduces the number of calls to the client when changes all occur
        during a single run loop).

        Because the MediaStreamTrackPrivate may be started externally (not by the MediaStreamTrack directly),
        add a new client method that notifies observers when the track has been started, and the
        MediaStreamTrack will use this notification to update the document with it's new mediaState().

        [Cocoa] Expand system-ui to include every item in the Core Text cascade list
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173043
        <rdar://problem/21125708>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The concept of the system font on Cocoa platforms represents the entire Core Text cascade list.
        However, previously, WebKit only represented system-ui by pulling out the first item in the Core
        Text cascade list. Instead, we should make all text rendered with "system-ui" match what the
        platform would natively render.

        Previously, we walked through the strings in the font-family property and looked them up one by
        one. However, now we want to abstract this idea of a font family to possibly hold a
        CTFontDescriptorRef instead of a string. This way, we expand a font-family list of ["fontA",
        "system-ui", "fontB"] to ["fontA", ... a bunch of CTFontDescriptorRefs ..., "FontB"]. We can
        then modify the consumer of this object to have two codepaths: the old string-based codepath,
        and a new, platform-specific codepath which simply embeds the CTFontDesriptorRefs inside a Font
        object.

        We don't want to simply pull out the family name from each item in the Core Text fallback list
        because that is a lossy translation. There is more information in these font descriptors which
        cannot be represented by CSS. Therefore, we must keep the descriptors alive and add the new
        codepath for them.

        We also don't want to run the CSS font matching algorithm on each member of the Core Text
        fallback list because it may yield different results from Core Text's font matching algorithm.
        Our goal is to draw text as closely as possible to the system APIs. If we ran it, we may find
        a font which is closer to the requested traits, but it would look out of place on the system.

        This new codepath is only enabled on macOS High Sierra and iOS 11, because enabling it on all
        operating systems would make fixing https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173300 impossible.

        API Test: Tests/WebKit2/MediaStreamTrackDetached.mm

        Move the definition of a MediaStream as a MediaProducer from the stream itself to its constituent
        MediaStreamTracks. This ensures that, even if a MediaStreamTrack is removed from its stream, the
        document (and thus the clients) are notified that media capture is still occurring.

        Though MediaStream is no longer a MediaProducer, it still uses the MediaProducer's state concept
        to determine when to fire events. However it's mediaState() implementation will be moved into
        MediaStreamTrack, and will instead simply bitwise-or together each of it's track's mediaState().

        The MediaStream notifies the document that its state has changed asynchronously, so do the same
        for MediaStreamTrack (which reduces the number of calls to the client when changes all occur
        during a single run loop).

        Because the MediaStreamTrackPrivate may be started externally (not by the MediaStreamTrack directly),
        add a new client method that notifies observers when the track has been started, and the
        MediaStreamTrack will use this notification to update the document with it's new mediaState().

        Using -[WebItemProviderPasteboard setItemProviders:] to swap out item providers before a drop breaks item provider loading
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173338
        <rdar://problem/32777720>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, replacing the list of UIItemProviders right before a drop is handled results in
        WebItemProviderPasteboard failing to load non-"public.content"-conformant items. This is because DragController
        computes and sends to the UI process a list of UTIs to load (preferredTypeIdentifiers: one type identifier for
        each item provider in WebItemProviderPasteboard). However, if the list of item providers changes immediately
        before a drop is performed, WebItemProviderPasteboard will get into an inconsistent state where it has a
        different number of preferred type identifiers to load than available item providers. This causes
        WebItemProviderPasteboard to fail when choosing what type identifiers to load from each item provider.

        To fix this, we instead have the web process propagate a list of supported type identifiers to the UI process,
        which is a property of only the drop destination rather than both the destination and item providers. When
        performing a drop, we then use the current item providers on WebItemProviderPasteboard to consult this list of
        supported type identifiers to resolve our list of preferred type identifiers to load.

        Globally renames updatePreferredTypeIdentifiers to updateSupportedTypeIdentifiers.

        We found two issues related to media documents while rebaselining the dedicated tests.

        First, we needed to expose the --inline-controls-bar-height CSS variable to <video>
        elements in media documents that are actually showing an audio UI. Previously we would
        only expose the variable to <audio> elements.

        Also, due to webkit.org/b/173387, we would fail to identify certain media documents as
        video because the videoTracks weren't set yet when the "loadedmetadata" event would be
        triggered. So now we also look at the videoWidth and videoHeight properties, which should
        provide accurate information in the "loadedmetadata" event handler.

        Previously, we had set the background color of the video layer to black in order to make the rect
        occupied by the HTMLMediaElement fully opaque. This worked around a graphics corruption bug. Since
        then, the code in RenderVideo::foregroundIsKnownToBeOpaqueInRect(...) has been fixed to fully account

        REGRESSION (r217997): mint.com header renders incorrectly when initially loaded
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173302
        <rdar://problem/32731747>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        r217997 updated ImplicitAnimation::reset() to not call updateStateMachine(AnimationStateInput::RestartAnimation)
        if the compositeAnimation is suspended. If the compositeAnimation is suspended, we would call
        updateStateMachine(AnimationStateInput::AnimationStateInput::PlayStatePaused), which was expected to be a no-op.
        This was needed because otherwise, changing the style of the animated element would restart the animation
        even though it was supposed to be suspended. One thing I did not realize is that calling
        updateStateMachine(AnimationStateInput::AnimationStateInput::PlayStatePaused) on an animation that is already
        in PausedNew state, will cause it to move to PausedWaitResponse state. This is an issue because upon resuming
        we would call AnimationBase::updatePlayState(AnimPlayStatePlaying) which would return early because
        AnimationBase::paused() would return false. To address the issue, we no longer call updateStateMachine(PlayStatePaused)
        in ImplicitAnimation::reset() when the compositeAnimation is suspended, so that the animation stays in
        PausedNew state until we resume. When we resume, AnimationBase::paused() returns false and we actually resume
        the animation.

        REGRESSION(r216901): ImageDecoders: rendering of large images is broken since r216901
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172502

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        When using GTK and WPE image decoders, the decoded frames are stored inside a Vector of
        ImageFrames inside the decoders. These ImageFrames have and ImageBackingStore with the
        pixels. When a NativeImagePtr is requested, a cairo surface is created from the data
        in those ImageBackingStores, but the data keeps being owned by the backing stores. Due
        to this, if the decoder that created the image gets destroyed, the backing stores for
        the decoded frames get destroyed as well, causing the cairo surfaces that were using
        that data to contain garbage (and potentially cause a crash).

        To fix this, we change ImageBackingStore so the pixels are stored in a SharedBuffer. The
        buffer will be reffed everytime a cairo surface is created with it, and the cairo surfaces
        will unref the buffer when they are destroyed. This way, the pixel data won't be freed
        while there are cairo surfaces using it.

        No new tests, no behaviour change.

        Event handlers should not be called in frameless documents
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173233

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        As per the HTML specification [1], for event handlers on elements, we should use the
        element's document to check if scripting is disabled [2]. Scripting is considered to
        be disabled if the document has no browsing context (i.e. a frame in WebKit terms).

        In JSLazyEventListener::initializeJSFunction(), instead of using the element's
        document to do the checks, we would use the script execution context. In most cases,
        a node's document and its script execution context are the same so this is not an
        issue. However, if the node's document is a document created via JS, its nodes'
        script execution context will be the document's context document (i.e the one that
        created the document, see implementation of Node::scriptExecutionContext()). In those
        cases, using the wrong document is an issue because the document's context document
        (aka script execution context) may allow scripting but we still do not want to call
        the event handler because its document is frameless.

        This impacts documents created by JS, using the following APIs:
        - DOMParser.parseFromHTML
        - new Document()
        - DOMImplementation.createDocument / createHTMLDocument
        - XHRs whose responseType is Document.

        [GStreamerGL] Release GstVideoFrame when there is a flush event from the pipeline
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172427

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        Without GStreamerGL MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer copies the video frame from
        the decoder's buffer to the texture to display a video. So it makes possible
        to release the GstSample when it got a flush start event to free the decoder's
        buffer to the decoder without side-effects.

        Unlike the traditional way to render video, GStreamer GL does not copy a
        texture from the decoder to the texture mapper's buffer to draw video frame.
        It uses same GstMemory with the gst pipeline to manage the texture to prevent
        copy operations. So without releasing a layer buffer, there is no way to
        return GstMemory to the buffer pool.

        This patch releases current GstSample when the player got the flush start
        event.  It destructs the platform layer buffer any time there is a flush start
        event.

        However, it is not enough to release the GstMemory. The platform layer proxy
        should copy current buffer to show it to the compositor instead of a blank
        frame. It prevents flickerings until getting a new frame after handling flush
        events.

        No new tests, there shouldn't be behavior changes

        [Cocoa] Expand system-ui to include every item in the Core Text cascade list
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173043
        <rdar://problem/21125708>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The concept of the system font on Cocoa platforms represents the entire Core Text cascade list.
        However, previously, WebKit only represented system-ui by pulling out the first item in the Core
        Text cascade list. Instead, we should make all text rendered with "system-ui" match what the
        platform would natively render.

        Previously, we walked through the strings in the font-family property and looked them up one by
        one. However, now we want to abstract this idea of a font family to possibly hold a
        CTFontDescriptorRef instead of a string. This way, we expand a font-family list of ["fontA",
        "system-ui", "fontB"] to ["fontA", ... a bunch of CTFontDescriptorRefs ..., "FontB"]. We can
        then modify the consumer of this object to have two codepaths: the old string-based codepath,
        and a new, platform-specific codepath which simply embeds the CTFontDesriptorRefs inside a Font
        object.

        We don't want to simply pull out the family name from each item in the Core Text fallback list
        because that is a lossy translation. There is more information in these font descriptors which
        cannot be represented by CSS. Therefore, we must keep the descriptors alive and add the new
        codepath for them.

        We also don't want to run the CSS font matching algorithm on each member of the Core Text
        fallback list because it may yield different results from Core Text's font matching algorithm.
        Our goal is to draw text as closely as possible to the system APIs. If we ran it, we may find
        a font which is closer to the requested traits, but it would look out of place on the system.

        <rdar://problem/32554450>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We have logic in CSSFontAccessor::font() which disallows downloading a CSSFontFace if that CSSFontFace
        is already in the Succeeded state. However, it was possible for a succeeded CSSFontFace to still fail
        to create a font. In this situation, we wouldn't be able to use the downloaded font, and we wouldn't
        try to download the next item in the src: list because the CSSFontFace is succeeded.

        This patch strengthens the meaning of the Succeeded state. Previously, it just meant that the bytes
        in the file were downloaded successfully. This patch extends this to also mean that the bytes in the
        file can be successfully interpreted as a font. This way, the CSSFontFace in the example above won't be
        set to the Succeeded state, so we will continue follow the src: list and download the secondary fonts.

        This has an added benefit that the CSS Font Loading API's promises will be called more appropriately.
        The transition to the Succeeded state will trigger a resolve of the promise. Now, these promises will
        only be resolved if the fonts are actually parsed and understood by our text system.

        invoked immediately, if a synchronous timeout is specified and loading finishes before the synchronous timeout
        is reached. To do this, we first factor out the completion logic into a new block. If the synchronous timeout
        exists and dispatch_group_wait returns 0 (indicating that the dispatch group finished without hitting the

        Use the utility functions from the GCryptUtilities.h header instead
        of writing the same code in both CryptoKeyEC and CryptoKeyRSA
        implementations. The switches are straightforward, the only difference
        is that the GCryptUtilities functions return a std::optional<> object,
        meaning we have to address possibly invalid return value.

        The mpiData() function is overloaded, making it possible to pass to it
        either a gcry_sexp_t or gcry_mpi_t object. Additionally, mpiLength()
        function is added, overloading again for gcry_sexp_t and gcry_mpi_t.
        This function is used from mpiData() as well as in CryptoKeyRSA when
        retrieving the RSA modulus length.

        didMoveToNewDocument doesn't get called on an Attr inside a shadow tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173133

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The bug was caused by moveShadowTreeToNewDocument never calling didMoveToNewDocument on Attr nodes.
        Fixed the bug by using the same traversal code as moveTreeToNewScope in moveShadowTreeToNewDocument
        by extracting the traversal code as a templatized traverseSubtreeToUpdateTreeScope.

        Also removed the code to increment the DOM tree version in moveTreeToNewScope. This code was there
        to invalidate the HTML collection caches which used to clear the cache whenever the DOM tree version
        changed before r122621 (five years ago! by me). Since we now eagerly invalidate each node list and
        HTML collection's caches via NodeListsNodeData::adoptTreeScope and NodeListsNodeData::adoptDocument.

        WebPreviewLoader's SubresourceLoader can reach a terminal state while data is loading from
        QLPreviewConverter (the user can cancel, for instance). We can't call functions like
        didReceiveResponse() in this state, because the loader no longer points to a CachedResource,
        leading to null pointer dereferences.

        Fix this in WebPreviewLoader by checking if the SubresourceLoader is in a terminal state
        before calling didReceiveResponse(), didReceiveData(), didFinishLoading(), and didFail().

        Fixes web process crashes in the QuickLook.CancelNavigationAfterResponse API test.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        CSS transitions added while page is not visible would not start when the page becomes
        visible. The issue was that when CompositeAnimation::updateTransitions() was called
        while the page is hidden (and animations are therefore suspended), it would not
        populate m_transations with ImplicitAnimation objects. We would therefore have later
        no transitions to resume when the page becomes visible later on. This patch updates
        CompositeAnimation::updateTransitions() to properly populate m_transitions and instead
        pause the ImplicitAnimation it creates if animations are currently suspended. This
        behavior is more consistent with the one of CompositeAnimation::updateKeyframeAnimations().

        I also needed to update ImplicitAnimation::animate() to not restart a paused animation
        if the animation is currently paused. This is similar to what is done in
        KeyframeAnimation::animate(). Without this, the paused ImplicitAnimation we add to
        m_transition would incorrectly get unpaused while the page is still hidden and the
        animations are still supposed to be suspended. This issue was showing when running the
        test I am adding in this patch.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        We need to premultiply alpha when creating a cairo surface from a GStreamer video frame, if the frame
        has an alpha component. Currently this is wrongly done in VideoSinkGStreamer, as it assumes that every
        frame is going to be rendered with cairo, which is not the case when using accelerated compositing.
        The premultiply must happen inside ImageGStreamerCairo, which is where we know that the frame is
        going to be rendered with cairo, and where the premultiply can be performed when gstreamer-gl is
        enabled as well.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Renamed TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded to setTreeScopeRecursively and moved to Node.

        The old name was really confusing because due to the existence of Document::adoptNode, a DOM API,
        which removes the adopted node from its parent if there was one before adopting the node.
        Most confusingly, this function called TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded.

        Also inlined the tree scope check to avoid calling to moveTreeToNewScope when there is nothing to do.

        This patch effectively reverts r104528.

        Add the notion of phase, momentum phase and swipe velocity to PlatformWheelEvent.

        Depending on whether the scrolling ended normally or triggered a swipe, the scroll animator will either compute

        [GCrypt] ECDSA signing results can be smaller than the EC key size
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171535

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        The libgcrypt-based implementation of the ECDSA signing operation does not
        properly address the resulting `r` and `s` integers that do not potentially
        match the EC key in terms of size.

        To address that, the retrieved MPI data for both integers is handled depending
        on the size of said data. Strictly requiring an amount of bytes that matches
        the key data size N, we simply take the last N bytes if the MPI data is equal
        or larger than N in size. If smaller, we first append enough zero bytes to the
        output Vector object before attaching the MPI data in whole so that the amount
        of appended bytes matches N.

        No new tests -- covers an implementation detail that is not trivial to test,
        but can rely sufficiently on existing tests.

        [Cocoa] Expand system-ui to include every item in the Core Text cascade list
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173043
        <rdar://problem/21125708>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The concept of the system font on Cocoa platforms represents the entire Core Text cascade list.
        However, previously, WebKit only represented system-ui by pulling out the first item in the Core
        Text cascade list. Instead, we should make all text rendered with "system-ui" match what the
        platform would natively render.

        Previously, we walked through the strings in the font-family property and looked them up one by
        one. However, now we want to abstract this idea of a font family to possibly hold a
        CTFontDescriptorRef instead of a string. This way, we expand a font-family list of ["fontA",
        "system-ui", "fontB"] to ["fontA", ... a bunch of CTFontDescriptorRefs ..., "FontB"]. We can
        then modify the consumer of this object to have two codepaths: the old string-based codepath,
        and a new, platform-specific codepath which simply embeds the CTFontDesriptorRefs inside a Font
        object.

        We don't want to simply pull out the family name from each item in the Core Text fallback list
        because that is a lossy translation. There is more information in these font descriptors which
        cannot be represented by CSS. Therefore, we must keep the descriptors alive and add the new
        codepath for them.

        We also don't want to run the CSS font matching algorithm on each member of the Core Text
        fallback list because it may yield different results from Core Text's font matching algorithm.
        Our goal is to draw text as closely as possible to the system APIs. If we ran it, we may find
        a font which is closer to the requested traits, but it would look out of place on the system.

        [GTK][WPE][GSTREAMER_GL] Change the colorspace used by the video frames provided by GStreamer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173050

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        We are currently requesting RGBA as the color format of the video frames to gstreamer. This is a problem
        because when those frames are rendered with the CPU, the R and B components are swapped as cairo expects
        ARGB and GStreamer delivers ABGR.

        In order to fix this without performing color conversions on the CPU, what we do is change the format
        used by GStreamer for the video frames. We do that taking into account the endianness used. So with
        little endian we will use BGRx or BGRA and with big endian xRGB or ARGB. Thanks to this, when downloading
        the frames to the CPU they will automatically be turned into the ARGB expected by cairo. Also, when
        rendering the frames using OpenGL, we indicate that the color space needs to be converted to the RGBA
        expected by the destination texture (but this color conversion is performed by the GPU so there's no
        penalty).

        IsInShadowTreeFlag does not get updated for a non-container node
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173084

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        insertedInto and removedFrom were only called on ContainerNode nodes when they're not connected to a document.
        As a result IsInShadowTreeFlag could have gotten out-of-date when a node was inserted or removed from a shadow root
        which is not connected to a document.

        Fixed this inconsistency by always falling insertedInto and removedFrom on all nodes.

        * dom/ContainerNodeAlgorithms.cpp:
        (WebCore::notifyNodeInsertedIntoDocument): Merged notifyDescendantInsertedIntoDocument. Now takes a Node instead
        of a ContainerNode.

        It it possible that the main thread will modify the m_tap member by calling

        provided by MediaToolbox in the callback. We assume the tap ref is retained by

        [GCrypt] RSA-PSS support

        Reviewed by Jiewen Tan.

        Implement RSA-PSS support for Web Crypto API in ports that use libgcrypt.

        For the signing operation, the digest algorithm is determined and used to
        compute the hash of the passed-in data. The given salt length and hash results
        are embedded into a data s-expression, specifying PSS as the preferred type of
        padding. This s-expression and the provided key are then passed to the
        gcry_pk_sign() call which computes the signature. The MPI data of this signature
        is retrieved and its size validated before being passed to the success callback.

        For the verification operation, the hash of the passed-in data is computed as
        before, embedding it into a data s-expression along with the specified salt
        length. The passed-in signature data is embedded into a sig-val s-expression.
        The two s-expressions are passed to the gcry_pk_verify() call along with the
        key. If the returned error code for this operation is GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR the
        verification is deemed successful, while in case of any other error code (which
        might indicate a verification failure or an operation error) we simply signal

        Creating a TextIndicator that is hundreds of thousands of pixels tall
        is not a good idea. We introduced TextIndicatorOptionDoNotClipToVisibleRect

        contain the entire image, instead of just the visible fragment.
        Instead, rename this option to ExpandClipBeyondVisibleRect, and make it
        not unclip *entirely*, but expand the clip significantly (50% in each direction)
        beyond the bounds of the current visible rect. Also, make use of exposed
        area information for this clipping; otherwise, clients with very large views
        inside scrollable areas (like Mail) would still try to create large TextIndicators.

        As part of the table layout, RenderTableSection::layoutRows calls the RenderTableCell's layout() directly
        (skipping the RenderTableRow parent). If during this call the RenderTableCell (or any of its descendant) marks the ancestor
        chain dirty, this dirty flag on the RenderTableRows will never be cleared and we'll end up early returning from RenderTableSection::paint.
        For certain type of float objects, we need to invalidate the line layout path during layout (and we mark the ancestors dirty).
        This patch takes a conservative approach and marks the ancestors dirty only when the renderer is not dirty yet, but
        as part of webkit.org/b/172947 we should revisit and validate whether the setNeedsLayout() is required at all.

        variable itself and therefore we do not need to pass it ourselves.

        [GStreamer] Use the same draw timer and mutex when AC disabled or building without OpenGL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172923

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        We have two different paths to do the same. When building without OpenGL, the VideoRenderRequestScheduler has
        its own timer and we need to add ifdefs to handle that. But when building with OpenGL we still support
        non-accelerated rendering that does the same than the VideoRenderRequestScheduler timer, but using the media
        player timer instead. We can simplify the code and remove more ifdefs by using the media player timer and mutex
        in all cases for non-accelerated rendering.

        Update media controls to match latest design specs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172932

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The media controls specs have changed and we now implement them. The main controls bar now
        appears to be floating, with a rounded corners and a margin around it. Some of the controls
        it used to contain now may appear outside of it. Specifically, the fullscreen and
        picture-in-picture buttons now are displayed in a dedicated controls bar in the top-left
        corner and the mute button, on iOS (where we don't support changing the volume when inline),
        is displayed in the top right corner.

        Another small UI improvement is that we display an activity indicator when we are waiting
        for data to initiate or resume playback instead of showing the elapsed time label. We also
        make displaying the scrubber more important than displaying other controls, except for the
        play/pause button, when width becomes scarce. Finally, we no longer use a speci layer type
        for the controls bar backgrounds, we now use the same "backdrop-filter" and tint overlay
        on both macOS and iOS.

        Since this work had previously been done through WebKitAdditions, we remove the specific
        build phase code that we added for this purpose and are now only ever looking for media
        controls code in the WebCore source tree.

        Refactor -[WebItemProviderPasteboard valuesForPasteboardType:inItemSet:] to check readable types
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172891
        <rdar://problem/32204540>

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Tweaks some logic in PlatformPasteboardIOS and WebItemProviderPasteboard to correctly construct objects in
        -valuesForPasteboardType:inItemSet:. Previously, we have a hard-coded map of UTI type to Class in the form of
        static helpers titled is{RichText, String, URL, Image, Color}Type in WebItemProviderPasteboard. We would use
        these functions to determine whether an NSAttributedString, NSString, NSURL, UIImage or UIColor should be
        constructed using the loaded item provider data. This is incorrect for some UTIs, such as public.html, which
        cannot actually be used to construct an NSAttributedString -- this caused -valuesForPasteboardType:inItemSet: to
        always return nil when attempting to create an object corresponding to public.html.

        To fix this, we refactor -valuesForPasteboardType:inItemSet: to instead iterate through UIItemProviderReading-
        conformant classes in search for a class that can be created for the given UTI type. If no such class exists, we
        then fall back to custom WebKit handling of the dropped UTI type, which so far only includes reading an NSString
        with public.plain-text if the UTI is public.html (i.e. reading the HTML source from loaded item provider data).

        Covered by 2 new API tests:
        DataInteractionTests.ExternalSourceHTMLToContentEditable
        DataInteractionTests.ExternalSourceAttributedStringToContentEditable

        In some cases, -[WebItemProviderPasteboard valuesForPasteboardType:inItemSet:] may now return an
        NSAttributedString when an NSString was previously created. This adjusts for that possibility by returning just
        the plain text, -[NSAttributedString string], if the read object was an NSAttributedString.

        Modify Netflix controlsManager quirk to prevent only scrubbing

        rdar://problem/32228660

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        Instead of preventing Netflix from getting a controlsManager at all, this patch 
        ONLY prevents touch bar scrubbing from working. This means that Netflix will now 
        get controls in the TouchBar, it means that the play/pause and PiP buttons will be 
        functional, and it means that the timeline will accurately represent the current 
        time, BUT users will not be able to use the timeline to scrub the video. This also

        [GStreamer] Deadlock in MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::changePipelineState, web process often locks up on seeking in a youtube video that has already fully buffered
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170003

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        When video sink is requested to render a frame, the GstBaseSink preroll mutex is taken. Then WebKit media player
        schedules a repaint in the main thread, taking the draw mutex and waiting on draw condition. It can happen that
        before the repaint is done in the main thread, a pause is requested in the main thread, causing a change state
        from PLAYING to PAUSE. When the change state reaches the video sink gst_base_sink_change_state() tries to get
        the preroll mutex. This causes a deadlock because the main thread is waiting to get the preroll mutex, but the
        other thread is waiting for the main thread to do the repaint. GStreamer handles this case by calling unlock()
        on the video sink before trying to get the preroll mutex, but the media player doesn't cancel the pending
        repaint when using coordinated graphics. This patch adds a new signal to WebKitVideoSink "repaint-cancelled" to
        notify the media player to cancel the pending prepaint.

        [GTK][WPE] Do not force video sample's buffer release when the platformLayerProxy is inactive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172916

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        When MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase's plarformLayerProxy was inactive, a copy of the video sample
        was being done (without the buffer) and set, causing the sample's buffer to get freed. This was done
        to avoid stalling the gstreamer pipeline in situations where the video was set to display:none, as the
        platformLayerProxy would keep all the available buffers. But this can't happen nowadays as setting
        the video to display:none invalidates the proxy, causing it to release the references to the
        gstreamer buffers it's using. Also, the current code is causing a crash when using gstreamer-gl and
        the video is hidden but its contents are being painted through webgl or an accelerated canvas. So,
        remove this sample copy as it's not necessary anymore.

        [GTK][WPE] Fix the condition to decide whether the MediaPlayer can be rendered accelerated
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172852

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Before this change, in order to determine whether the MediaPlayer rendering could be accelerated we
        needed the player to have a renderer or it would return false. The renderer was needed in order to
        access the RenderLayerCompositor and check whether the chrome would be overwriting the accelerated
        compositing setting. But we don't have that option in WebKitGTK+ or WPE, so we can just check the
        accelerated compositing setting directly.

        Another problems with the approach before this change is that accelerated rendering was being disabled
        when the video element was not visible, as there's no video renderer. Due to this, cases where the video
        is painted through an accelerated canvas or webgl would not be using hardware accelerated copies.

        <rdar://problem/32548614>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        After implementing dragged content fading, RenderReplace::paint is now always guarded by unnecessary calls to
        GraphicsContext::save and GraphicsContext::restore, even when there is no dragged content being rendered. To
        address this, we initialize our GraphicsContextStateSaver with saveAndRestore = false, indicating that we don't
        want to immediately try and save the context.

        If we are in a dragged content range, we will then call GraphicsContextStateSaver::save, which saves the
        graphics context and also causes the GraphicsContextStateSaver to eventually try and restore() when it is
        destroyed. Otherwise, in the common codepath where the renderer is not in a dragged content range, the
        constructor and destructor of GraphicsContextStateSaver will be no-ops with respect to saving and restoring the
        graphics context.

        [css-grid] Logical margin incorrectly applied during the tracks sizing algorithm of auto tracks

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        When computing min-content and max-content of the content-sized tracks
        we are using the marginIntrinsicLogicalWidthForChild function, which
        uses the grid's writing-mode to determine wether to use the child's
        margin width or height. This is not correct when the grid item is
        orthogonal.

        This patch changes how we compute the tracks width so we use always
        the item's marginLogicalWidth, which depends only on its own writing
        mode.

        [GTK+][WPE] Allow TextureMapperShaderProgram to perform colorspace conversions with the source texture pixels
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172749

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        Currently TextureMapperGL is only able to paint properly textures that are in RGBA format. There are
        situations where we will want it to be able to handle other formats (for example BGRA for gstreamer-gl).
        To make this possible without having to perform the color conversion in the CPU, we add a new color
        conversion matrix to TextureMapperShaderProgram. This matrix will perform the color space conversion
        in the GPU, just after sampling the source texture.

        Also, add a new flag to TextureMapperGL to indicate that a color conversion is required to handle a
        texture. This flag will be set to the TextureMapperPlatformLayerBuffers as required, and TextureMapperGL
        will set the appropriate color space matrix to the shader. Initially only the flag for BGRA->RGBA conversion
        is defined, but support for new transformations can be added as needed.

        VideoTextureCopierGStreamer also uses the TextureMapperShaderProgram to perform texture sampling, but for
        the moment it just sets an identity matrix because when using gstreamer-gl, the format of the video frames
        is RGBA. This will be changed soon to use BGRA.

        No new tests.

        We need to consider orthogonality when using the item's logical margin to

        The issue this patch fixes is only reproducible when the grid layout logic

        [GTK] Cache RenderThemeGadget hierarchies for rendering themed elements with GTK+ 3.20+
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162673

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Because of the way the new theming system works in GTK+ >= 3.20 we are currently creating a gadget hierarchy
        every time we need to render a styled element or get layout information about it. That's happening on every
        repaint, and it's specially problematic for overlay scrollbar indicators that fade in/out when shown/hidden. We
        need to cache the gadgets and simply apply the state before every paint or layout query. When using GtkWidgetPath,
        calling gtk_style_context_save() breaks the gadget hierarchy, and style classes need to be set when building the
        GtkWidgetPath. That means we can't cache RenderThemeGadgets, call save, apply style classes and state, and then
        call restore. We need to cache gadget hierarchies with fixed style classes. Fortunately, setting the state does
        work, so we don't need to also cache a different hierarchy for every possible state. For example, for the
        particular case of scrollbars we would cache VerticalScrollbarRight, VerticalScrollbarLeft, HorizontalScrollbar,
        VerticalScrollIndicatorRight, VerticalScrollIndicatorLeft and HorizontalScrollIndicator. In practice, we will
        only have 4 of those at the same time in the cache.
        This patch adds RenderThemeWidget to represent a hierarchy of gadgets with fixed style classes that can be
        cached and reused to render or query style of those "widgets". It also simplifies the RenderThemeGtk and
        ScrollbarThemeGtk code by removing a lot of duplicated code to build the gadget hierarchies.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172806

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Currently, the scrolling coordinator does not manage scrolling of frames other than the main
        one (bugs 171667 and 149264) and so ScrollingCoordinator::updateSynchronousScrollingReasons
        is only relevant for the main frame. This commit refactors a bit ScrollingCoordinator so that
        updateSynchronousScrollingReasons is considered for all the frames whose scrolling is
        coordinated by the ScrollingCoordinator so non-main frames will be considered in the future.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        ScrollingStateScrollingNode::ChangedProperty::NumScrollingStateNodeBits was introduced in
        r133022 so that ScrollingStateFrameScrollingNode and ScrollingStateOverflowScrollingNode
        know the number of bits use for properties in their parent class.

        In r172649, r210560, r185762 and r183702 new properties were added to
        ScrollingStateScrollingNode but NumScrollingStateNodeBits was not increased accordingly. This
        means that there are potential conflicts between these new properties and those of derived
        classes ScrollingStateFrameScrollingNode and ScrollingStateOverflowScrollingNode. It is not
        clear how to write a test case reproducing such conflict, though.

        We updated getClientRects() to return an array of DOMRect objects instead of
        a ClientRectList type, to match the latest specification. As it turns out, this
        is not Web-compatible as some content (as Google Spreadsheet) relies on the
        return type having an item() operation.

        This patch re-introduces a DOMRectList type, with an item() operation. The

        [GTK][WPE][GSTREAMER_GL] Do not use cairo to copy video textures to an accelerated canvas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172542

        Reviewed by Žan Doberšek.

        When drawing gstreamer-gl video frames into an accelerated canvas, we are currently using cairo to copy
        the video textures into a new texture that will be painted into de destination canvas. While this eases
        the code, it doesn't allow us to control the copy process. This is a problem because in order to use
        gstreamer-gl properly, we will need to perform colorspace transformations during the copy. So, remove
        this cairo copy and use VideoTextureCopierGStreamer instead.

        The usage of VideoTextureCopierGStreamer is pretty much the same than in the webgl case, except that
        no destination texture is provided. For that case, add a custom texture to hold the result that can
        be requested after the copy.

        Use the parent box style to adjust RenderStyle for alignment.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The css-flexbox spec defined align-self in terms of the parent
        element, which is what this code did.

        The css-align spec defines these properties in terms of the style of
        the containing box instead, which means display: contents styles
        should not be used for this adjustment, but the parent box style
        instead.

        For example, align-items is defined as:

        > This property specifies the default align-self for all of the boxes
        > (including anonymous boxes) participating in this box’s formatting
        > context.

        Note that the css-align spec was recently updated to align (no pun
        intended) with Gecko, and make the |auto| value compute to itself.
        This patch puts us in a more recent spec than before, but not totally
        up-to-date.

        [WebIDL] @@iterator should only be accessed once when disambiguating a union type
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172684

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        WebIDL specifies that when determining if the value you are converting to a union
        is a sequence, you must get the @@iterator property and, should it exist, use it
        to iterate the sequence. While we correctly accessing the property to make the 
        determination, we were not passing it into the sequence conversion code, and thus
        the sequence conversion code re-accessed it, which is observable and wrong.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Fix assertion hit when running imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/html/semantics/forms/form-control-infrastructure/form_attribute.html.

        When the form was removed from the document, A descendant would try to find a new form owner in the document. If the descendant had 
        a form content attribute and there was another form in the document with this ID, then we would erroneously associate the descendant with
        that other form, even though that descendant is being disconnected. This is because when the form with the given id is removed, we
        notify the IdTargetObservers of the change. In this case, the form control is an IdTargetObserver and gets notified after
        removedFrom() has been called on the form but *before* removedFrom() has been called on its descendant form control. As a result, the
        form control still thinks it is in the tree (i.e. isConnected() wrongly returns true) and we make the wrong decision and try to
        associate it with another form in the document.

        To address the problem, we leverage the fact that when a form element is being removed, it already notifies its associated form
        controls that it is being removed. When it does, we make sure to clear the control's id observer if the form is its ancestor.
        The ID observer is no longer needed beyond this point since the control is now disconnected from the document, and the ID observer
        callback would erroneously associate it with another form element in the document of the same ID because isConnected() still returns
        true at that point.
        As a result, the control's form owner is kept unchanged, which is the right thing to do here, since it is its ancestor, even
        though both are detached.

        (WebCore::Node::traverseToRootNode):
        Add a traverseToRootNode() method which gets the root node by traversing the ancestors. This logic was duplicated in 3 places:

        - computeRootNode() in FormAssociatedElement.cpp
        - findRoot() in HTMLFormElement.cpp

        Just simplify the logic a bit:
        - Clear the id observer (i.e. m_formAttributeTargetObserver) no matter what. Since the element is no longer part of the document,
          it is no longer needed. We would previously have checks that would basically avoid resetting m_formAttributeTargetObserver to
          null if it is already null. Settign m_formAttributeTargetObserver to null is cheap so there is no reason for those checks. Those
          checks were also confusing because they made it look like we would sometimes keep on id observer after being removed from the
          document.
        - Use new traverseToRootNode() utility function (no behavior change)
        - Drop unnecessary |element| local variable

        (WebCore::FormAssociatedElement::formOwnerRemovedFromTree):
        - Rename to formOwnerRemovedFromTree() to make it clear that it is the element's form owner that is removed, and not just any form.
        - As we traverse the tree up to find the root, also check if we find the form owner. If we do, clear the id observer since we are
          effectively detached from the document and return early since there is no need to reset our form owner in this case.

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        - Codifies naming for both parts of the operation/attribute function implementation:
          - The 'trampoline' which is the actual host function and simply calls IDLOperation,
            IDLOperationReturningPromise or IDLAttribute.
          - The 'body' which is where argument checking and calling into the implementation
            takes place.
        - Made it so all operations, including static ones, use the trampoline / body model,
          simplifying code generation. The one exception is for overloaded operations, which
          now have a trampoline and body for the dispatcher, and only bodies for all the 
          overloads. This is what fixes the bug, since now that the dispatcher has a trampoline,
          it can do the correct this object checking via IDLOperation / IDLOperationReturningPromise.
        - Split out code generation for trampoline and body into separate subroutines and 
          simplified their implementations.
        - Changed GenerateOverloadDispatcher to only generate the body of the function, leaving it
          up to the caller to generate the signature, braces and conditionals if needed.
        - Made more subroutines take an output array and indent, in support of future endeavors
          that will need that support.

        [WebIDL] Another bindings cleanup pass, this time focusing on attributes

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        - Moved attribute getter / setter generation into their own subroutines.
        - As was done for operations, moved trampoline functions for attributes
          below their implementation functions to avoid unseemly forward declaration.
        - Changed to place the getter and setter for an attribute next to each other,
          rather than having all the getters and then all the setters.
        - Moved JSFoo::getConstructor and JSFoo::getNamedConstructor up to be with other
          member functions.
        - Fix an issue where we were generating a setJSFooConstructor function and not
          installing it anywhere. Now we always generate either both the getter and setter
          or neither for the constructor property. Also moved their definition to just above
          all the attributes, rather than the odd placements of between the getters and
          setters which is where they had been.
        - Made InstanceNeedsVisitChildren a complete answer, rather than relying on some
          loop of the attributes to update needsVisitChildren bit.
        - Move use of passing conditionals when adding headers.

        We use that bit of information to determine whether we need to tear
        down the renderers of a display: contents subtree, so better for it to
        not change until the render tree is updated.

        In practice, we may want to remove that bit and use ElementRareData's
        RenderStyle instead (keeping it around as appropriate), to ensure they
        don't go out of sync, but that's out of scope of this patch for now.

        Before r215686, the loop would have a check at the beginning to check if the
        dataRequest's currentOffset was greater than the buffer length and would
        cause the function to return early.

        This check was dropped in r215686, which caused us in some cases to call
        finishLoading / stopLoading() after the loop, even though we did not have
        enough data in the buffer to satisfy the data request.

        To address the issue, we now return early after the loop if remainingLength
        is greater than 0, meaning that we could not satisfy the request. This makes
        sure we do not call finishLoading / stopLoading() prematurely.

        Note that before r215686, the condition of the while loop was 
        "while (remainingLength)" so the only way to get out of the loop was to:
        1. Get remainingLength to 0, in which case we would fall through and
           potentially call finishLoading / stopLoading() after the loop.
        2. Fail the "(data->size() <= [dataRequest currentOffset] - responseOffset)"
           check at the beginning of the loop, meaning that we ran out of data in
           the buffer. This would cause us to return from the function, not fall
           through, so we would not call finishLoading / stopLoading().

        No new tests, I do not know how to write a test for this.

        DocumentThreadableLoader::redirectReceived() should not rely on the resource's loader. The rest of the methods do not.
        It is unsafe for it to rely on the resource's loader because it gets cleared when the load completes. A CachedRawresource
        may be reused from the memory cache once its load has completed.

        This would cause crashes in CachedRawResource::didAddClient() when replaying the redirects because it would call
        DocumentThreadableLoader::redirectReceived() and potentially not have a loader anymore. To hit this exact code path,
        you would need to make repeated XHR to a cacheable simple cross-origin resource that has cacheable redirect.

        [css-grid] Fix behavior of positioned items without specific dimensions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172117

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        Currently positioned items that doesn't have specific dimensions
        are not properly sized. This patch fixes the issues with them.

        The patch removes the extraInline|BlockOffsets from RenderBox,
        so now RenderGrid is responsible of setting the location of the positioned item.
        This will be useful to add alignment support for positioned items later.
        It also removes grid specific logic from RenderBox.

        RenderBox::computeInlineStaticDistance() was modified too.
        The problem here was that the containing block of the positioned gird items
        is the grid area (and not the grid container). The method didn't know
        anything about grid, so it was using the grid container causing wrong values
        when resolving "auto" in both left and right offset properties.

        Note that after this patch we match Chrome and Firefox behavior on these cases.

        REGRESSION (r206481): Don't assume frameCount() is larger than or equal to the size of the image frame cache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172552

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        If an image with many cached ImageFrames is cached but its encoded data is
        freed, then the same image is reused, the encoded data will be fetched.
        But the initial frameCount() might be less than the current size of the
        ImageFrames cache.

        This was causing an assertion in the debug build and crash in the release
        build. Vector::grow() does not handle the case where the new size is smaller
        than the current size safely.

        Previously, when beginning writing images to the WebItemProviderPasteboard, we would create a new UIImage and
        use standard UIImage UIItemProviderWriting utilities to register the image to the pasteboard. This is lossy for
        gifs, since UIImage doesn't inherently know how to represent gifs. Instead, register the raw image data directly
        to the UTI type corresponding to the MIME type of the image, and use UIImage's item provider writing capability
        as a fallback when the raw resourceData is unavailable.

        Snapshotting via -renderInContext: should do synchronous image decodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172485
        rdar://problem/32276146

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When UIWebView clients snapshot the view via -renderInContext: on the UIView's layer,
        WebKit should do synchronous image decodes so that the images show in the snapshot.

        Fix by plumbing through a "snapshotting" paint behavior flag from two source locations:
        WebSimpleLayer, used by compositing layers, and LegacyTileLayer, used for the WK1 tile cache.
        On WebSimpleLayer the flag propagates through PlatformCALayer to GraphicsLayer, and on LegacyTileLayer
        it sets some state on the WAKWindow, which is detected by -[WebFrame _paintBehaviorForDestinationContext:].
        In both cases, the flag becomes PaintBehaviorSnapshotting which is passed down through painting
        in PaintInfo.paintBehavior.

        Fix code that was checking paintBehavior on the FrameView to just looking at PaintInfo.paintBehavior,
        which required passing PaintInfo along in RenderImage::paintIntoRect().

        We can't just use the PaintBehaviorFlattenCompositingLayers flag, because that triggers
        a flattening paint of compositing layers, and we don't want that behavior for -renderInContext:,
        since CoreAnimation calls -renderInContext: on each of our layers and we need to avoid double-painting.
        So PaintBehaviorSnapshotting is now added to the call sites that also set PaintBehaviorFlattenCompositingLayers
        in most cases.

        Tested by SnapshotViaRenderInContext API test.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch decouples the layout call logic from the post layout task timer setup.
        Just because we are switching over to asynchronous performPostLayoutTasks() it should not stop us from
        running layout on a dirty tree (we could encounter a forced layout (which sets m_postLayoutTasksTimer active)
        and a subsequent tree mutation during performPostLayoutTasks()). 

        There are a few different ways to end up here:
        root layout is done -> call performPostLayoutTasks() synchronously -> 
        1. tree stays clean -> no action needed.
        2. tree gets dirty -> setup performPostLayoutTasks timer -> run nested layout -> since m_postLayoutTasksTimer is active()
        we don't try to run performPostLayoutTasks() while in the nested layout and we return with a clean tree.

        Update font-style's implementation in the font selection algorithm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169453

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Previously, we were treating "font-style: oblique" exactly the same as "font-style: italic".
        These values were parsed to the same internal data type. However, variation fonts may have two
        distinct axes: 'slnt' and 'ital'. Therefore, we need to keep a bool of state which represents
        which of these two axes we should be setting when we apply font variations. We can do this by
        making the "font-style" parser a "custom" parser. The implementation of these custom functions
        will set both the italic value on the FontDescription as well as this extra bool.

        We don't, however, want to treat these values as distinct for the purposese of font selection.
        The fact that we treat oblique fonts the same as italic fonts is a feature, not a bug. Therefore,
        the font selection algorithm is not made aware of this distinction. This is why we don't want to
        package up the bool and FontSelectionValue into a class: font selection only cares about the
        FontSelectionValue, so conceptually they shouldn't be joined. (The FontSelectionValue already
        exists within a collection of all the things font selection needs to know about.)

        Now that there is this extra bit of state on the FontDescription, we can do a little better when
        computing the result of getComputedStyle(). Previously, we were always returning "italic" even
        when "oblique" was specified. Now, we can return the correct one. However, this extra bit of
        state is not kept on the CSSFontFace (because it doesn't need to be), which means we can only
        improve the computed style of an element, rather than the cssText of an @font-face rule.

        <rdar://32109532>

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        CachedRawResource::calculateIncrementalDataChunk was calling SharedBuffer::data each time the data
        was appended to the SharedBuffer. This causes the data to be copied from two segments to one segment,
        which causes the O(n^2) behavior I was worried about in r215686. These append/data/append/data calls
        used to cause O(1) copies per byte which was amortized because of the exponential growth of the buffer.
        After this change, there should be 0 copies per byte here, and instead a O(log(n)) binary search in the
        call to std::upper_bound to find the next segment of data with a given starting location in the SharedBuffer.
        We need to store the additional information of the offsets of the beginnings of the segments in a
        SharedBuffer. This doesn't asymptotically increase our memory usage, but it does allow us to asymptotically
        decrease the amount of time it takes to find data at a given offset in a SharedBuffer from O(n) to O(log(n)).

        This allows us to complete http://speedtest.xfinity.com and new functionality in SharedBuffer is covered by API tests.

        Resources in cached parsed stylesheets may bypass content blockers

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Resources in cached parsed stylesheets could bypass content blockers when they were in the memory cache and
        they did not need revalidation.

        To address the issue, I made StyleSheetContents::subresourcesAllowReuse() to check content blockers.
        If a subresource in the cached stylesheet is blocked, then we return false in subresourcesAllowReuse() and
        the cached parsed stylesheet will not be used.

        No new tests, not currently testable.

        Support transform-box to switch sizing box in SVG
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145783

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Add support for the CSS "transform-box" property, as described at
        <https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#transform-box>.
        
        This changes the behavior of percentage values in transform-origin in SVG.
        When these were added in r110532, percentage values in transform-origin were made
        relative to the bounding box, but absolute values relative to the view box.
        <https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/895> has concluded that this behavior
        is confusing. The new behavior is that, for SVG elements, both absolute and
        percentage values are relative to the reference box, which is specified by the
        new transform-box property.

        The initial value for transform-box is border-box, with the svg.css UA stylesheet
        supplying a default of view-box for the relevant SVG elements per
        <https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/styling.html#UAStyleSheet>.

        For non-SVG elements, the used value is always border-box, so there is no change
        in behavior.

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-paint-to-canvas.html

        In order to have access to decoded video data for painting, decode the encoded samples manually
        instead of adding them to the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer. To facilitate doing so, add a new
        utility class WebCoreDecompressionSession, which can decode samples and store them.

        For the purposes of this patch, to avoid double-decoding of video data and to avoid severe complication
        of our sample delivery pipeline, we will only support painting of decoded video samples when the video is
        not displayed in the DOM.

        This patch stops the redundant ellipsis box trigger ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION.

        In RootInlineBox::placeEllipsis we construct an ellipsis box and append it to a static HashMap which
        keeps track of the ellipsis boxes on each line. However when the line already has an ellipsis, we
        re-use the existing one and this newly constructed (but redundant) box gets destroyed as we return from this function.
        In InlineBox's d'tor, we let the parent know that now it has a dangling child and we assert on it
        later, while accessing the children list. However this redundant ellipsis box was never added to the line,
        so the assertion hits incorrectly.

        Bindings: Support runtime-enabled features in specific worlds

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Currently a function, attribute, or interface can be annotated with either EnabledAtRuntime
        or EnabledForWorld (not both) to expose/conceal it depending on the state of a runtime
        feature flag or the DOM world associated with the running JavaScript code, respectively.
        Even though we do not have any functions, attributes, or interfaces that are annotated
        with both EnabledAtRuntime and EnabledForWorld at the time of writing, it seems reasonable
        to support such a combination of annotations. This also has the benefit of making it
        straightforward to support the extended attribute SecureContext by generalizing the logic

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-paint-to-canvas.html

        In order to have access to decoded video data for painting, decode the encoded samples manually
        instead of adding them to the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer. To facilitate doing so, add a new
        utility class WebCoreDecompressionSession, which can decode samples and store them.

        For the purposes of this patch, to avoid double-decoding of video data and to avoid severe complication
        of our sample delivery pipeline, we will only support painting of decoded video samples when the video is
        not displayed in the DOM.

        [REGRESSION](r216901): Delete ImageDecoder if BitmapImage::destroyDecodedData() was called to destroy all the decoded frames
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172325

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When calling BitmapImage::destroyDecodedData() with destroyAll = true, the
        current ImageDecoder has to be deleted regardless the current frame needs
        to be cached or not. This is true except when the image is animating.
        Creating a new ImageDecoder for the animated image will lead to decoding
        all the frames from frame-zero till the current frame.

        Deleting the current ImageDecoder has the benefit of releasing its raster
        data. We also must delete the current ImageDecoder when the CachedImage
        switched its data SharedBuffer.

        The fix is return the condition in BitmapImage::destroyDecodedData() to 
        be as it was before r216901.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch stops the redundant ellipsis box trigger ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION.

        In RootInlineBox::placeEllipsis we construct an ellipsis box and append it to a static HashMap which
        keeps track of the ellipsis boxes on each line. However when the line already has an ellipsis, we
        re-use the existing one and this newly constructed (but redundant) box gets destroyed as we return from this function.
        In InlineBox's d'tor, we let the parent know that now it has a dangling child and we assert on it
        later, while accessing the children list. However this redundant ellipsis box was never added to the line,
        so the assertion hits incorrectly.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172300

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        A hardware-accelerated animation of the transform property
        requires layout to happen if it contains a translate operation
        using percentages, otherwise it may create an incorrect
        animation. The "50% of the time" comes in to play because
        the layout timer may sometimes fire before the animation
        timer. The test case contains a example that is much more
        likely to fail without this fix.

        REGRESSION (r209608): Cross-origin plugin document opened in child window blocked by parent
        window CSP when object-src 'none' is set
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172038
        <rdar://problem/32258262>

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        Fixes an issue where a cross-origin plugin document opened in a child window would inherit
        the Content Security Policy (CSP) of its opener. In particular, a cross-origin plugin
        document opened in a child window would be blocked when the CSP of its opener disallows
        plugins (e.g. object-source 'none').

        Prior to r209608 a document opened in a child window never inherited the CSP from its opener
        and a plugin document loaded in a subframe would unconditionally inherit the CSP from its
        parent frame. So, a plugin document opened in a child window would be allowed to load
        regardless of whether its opener had a CSP that prevented plugins. Following r209608 a
        document opened in a child window would inherit its CSP from its opener if and only if it
        would inherit the security origin from its opener (e.g. about:blank) or was a plugin
        document. The latter condition makes plugin documents opened in a child window unconditionally
        inherit the CSP from their opener and is the cause of this bug. It seems reasonable to exempt
        cross-origin plugin documents opened in a child window from the CSP inheritance rule because
        such documents cannot compromise the origin of their opener. Same-origin plugin documents
        opened in a child window will continue to inherit the CSP from their opener because such
        documents can compromise the origin of their opener.

        Calling the function MTAudioProcessingTapGetSourceAudio when the value of the

        This can for example happen if MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundationObjC::cancelLoad()
        is called on the main thread while MediaToolbox is calling the
        WebCore::AudioSourceProviderAVFObjC::processCallback function on a secondary
        thread. MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundationObjC::cancelLoad() will then call
        AudioSourceProviderAVFObjC::setPlayerItem(nullptr), which will call
        AudioSourceProviderAVFObjC::destroyMix(), which will set m_tap to null. When
        AudioSourceProviderAVFObjC::process is called on the secondary thread, using
        the m_tap member in the call to MTAudioProcessingTapGetSourceAudio, the process
        will crash.

        When the image decoding thread makes a callOnMainThread(), ensure all the objects it needs are protected
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171614

        Reviewed by David Kilzer.

        The asynchronous image decoding was designed to not block the main thread if
        the image is deleted. To achieve that we allow decoding the current frame
        even if it is not going to be used after closing the decoding queue. We 
        protect all the objects which the decoding thread uses. But when a frame
        finishes decoding the native image frame is cached on the main thread. Not
        all of the objects are protected when the callOnMainThread() is dispatched.
        The ImageFrameCache and the ImageDecoder objects are not protected.

        This might lead to two kinds of crashes:
        1. A segfault inside the ImageDecoder trying to access one of its member
        2. A segfault inside the ImageFrameCache trying to access one of its frames

        The fix is to protect the ImageFrameCache and the ImageDecoder when the
        decoding thread makes a callOnMainThread(). Also switch all the pointers
        the decoding threads protect to be ThreadSafeRefCounted.

        Previously, when writing a plain text string to WebItemProviderPasteboard, we would write an NSString directly
        to the item provider by using built-in functionality in NSString+UIItemProvider. However, this causes plain
        strings such as "apple" to be considered URLs, since -[NSURL URLWithString:] creates a non-null NSURL. To fix
        this, we instead write the string as UTF8 data, for the UTI kUTTypeUTF8PlainText, if the plain text is not a
        URL. If the plain text is clearly a URL (determined by constructing a new WebCore URL with no base URL and the
        plaintext string as the absolute URL) then we additionally write an NSURL to the pasteboard.

        runCleanupTasks()) may see a null context->script().

        Hence, WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() should null check context->script()

        REGRESSION(r212513): LastResort is platform-dependent, so its semantics should not be required to perform font loading correctly.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168487

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        There are three ways a Web author can chain multiple font files together:
        1. Multiple entries in the "src" descriptor in an @font-face rule
        2. Multiple @font-face rules with the same "font-family" descriptor
        3. Multiple entries in the "font-family" property on an element

        Before r212513, the code which iterated across #2 and #3 above could have
        triggered each item in the chain to download. r212513 tried to solve this
        by using LastResort as the interstitial font used during downloads, because
        LastResort supports every character and therefore solves #3 above. However,
        this change had a few problems:

        1. Previously, our code would try to avoid using the interstitial font for
        layout or rendering whenever possible (because one of the chains above may
        have named a local font which would be better to use). In order to use the
        benefits of LastResort, I had to remove this avoidance logic and make
        WebKit try to use the interstitial font as often as possible. However, due
        to the large metrics of LastResort, this means that offsetWidth queries
        during font loading would be wildly inaccurate, causing Google Docs to break.
        2. It also means that canvas drawing during font loading would actually draw
        LastResort, causing Bing maps to break.
        3. LastResort is platform-specific, so only platforms which have it would
        actually be able to load fonts correctly.

        Instead, we should keep the older logic about avoiding using the
        interstitial font so that loading has a better experience for the user.
        We solve the unnecessary download problem by giving our loading code a
        downloading policy enum, which has two values: allow downloads or forbid
        downloads. Whenever our loading code returns the interstitial font, we
        continue our search, but we change the policy to forbid downloads.

        There is one piece of subtlety, though: It is more common for web authors
        to put good fallbacks in the "font-family" property than in the "src"
        descriptor inside @font-face. This means that we shouldn't exhaustively
        search through the @font-face src list first. Instead, we should look
        through the src list until we hit a non-local font, and then immediately
        start looking through the other other chains.

        data off of item providers. Previously, we would bail early and not load any data if the temporary URL is
        missing an extension. Since the switch to NSItemProviders from UIItemProviders, some types of temporary files

        Do not delete asynchronously decoded frames for large images if their clients are in the viewport
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170640

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The image flickering problem happens when a large image is visible in the
        view port and for some reason, the decoded frame gets destroyed. When this
        image is repainted, BitmapImage::draw() does not find a valid decoded frame
        for that image. It then requests an async decoding for the image and just
        draws nothing in the image rectangle. Drawing no content between two drawing
        phases in which the image is drawn causes the unwanted flickering.

        To fix this issue we need to protect the decoded frames of all the images
        in the view port from being destroyed. When BitmapImage::destroyDecodedData()
        is called, it is going to check, through the ImageObserver, whether any
        of its clients is visible. And if so, the current decoded frame won't be
        destroyed.

        Tests: Modifying existing tests.

        Simplify RealtimeMediaSource data production and state
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171999

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        RealtimeMediaSource takes 3 booleans:
        - m_isProducingData tells whether data is produced or not. In the case of capturing, it tells whether capture
          happens.
        - m_muted/m_enabled allows JS or WebKit level to start/stop the source.

        Changed MediaStream capture state computation so that capture is reported as follows:
        - m_isProducing is true, capture is happenning and is active
        - m_muted is true, capture is happening but is inactive.

        Except in the case of WebRTC incoming sources, for which sources may be created as muted as per the spec,
        all sources are unmuted, enabled and not producing data when created.

        RealtimeMediaSource is now activable either by calling start/stop or by calling setMuted/setEnabled.
        This in turns will set the boolean values accordingly and will call the underlying
        startProducingData/stopProducingData methods doing the actual stuff.

        Removing from all RealtimeMediaSource subclasses the handling of producing data.
        Making more methods non-virtual/member fields private to simplify the model.

        Crash in libxml2.2.dylib: xmlDictReference
        <https://webkit.org/b/172086>
        <rdar://problem/23643436>

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Speculative fix and code clean-up based on source code
        inspection.  The fix for the crash is in two parts that change
        XSLStyleSheet::parseString():
        1. Always set m_stylesheetDoc to nullptr after freeing it via
           XSLStyleSheet::clearXSLStylesheetDocument().
        2. Add nullptr check before using m_stylesheetDoc from parent.

        Broadly speaking, the changes are:
        - Extract code to reset m_stylesheetDoc into new private
          XSLStyleSheet::clearXSLStylesheetDocument() method.  There is
          a special contract between m_stylesheetDoc and
          m_stylesheetDocTaken that wasn't being followed every time.
          See comment in XSLStyleSheet::compileStyleSheet().
        - XSLStyleSheet::clearDocuments() now calls new
          clearXSLStylesheetDocument() method.  Previously, it was not
          checking or resetting m_stylesheetDocTaken, and it might have
          leaked an xmlDocPtr if m_stylesheetDoc was set and
          m_stylesheetDocTaken was false.
        - XSLStyleSheet::parseString() now calls new
          clearXSLStylesheetDocument() method.  Previously, it did not
          clear m_stylesheetDoc after freeing it, and it could return
          early due to a failure in xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt().
        - In XSLStyleSheet::parseString() use checked arithmetic when
          calculating 'size' for xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt() and
          xmlCtxtReadMemory().  This code used to do an implicit
          unsigned -> signed integer conversion that could overflow.
        - Always iterate m_children using an 'auto& import' variable.

        * xml/XSLStyleSheet.h:
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::clearXSLStylesheetDocument): Add declaration.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::m_disabled): Add default initializer.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::m_stylesheetDoc): Ditto.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::m_stylesheetDocTaken): Ditto.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::m_parentStyleSheet): Ditto.

        * xml/XSLStyleSheetLibxslt.cpp:
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::XSLStyleSheet): Get rid of redundant
        initializers.  Set m_parentStyleSheet if needed.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::~XSLStyleSheet): Call
        clearXSLStylesheetDocument() instead of custom code.  Switch
        m_children fast iteration to use 'auto& import' variable.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::isLoading): Switch m_children fast
        iteration to use 'auto& import' variable.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::clearDocuments): Call
        clearXSLStylesheetDocument() instead of setting m_stylesheetDoc
        to nullptr.  This might fix an occasional xmlDocPtr leak.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::clearXSLStylesheetDocument): Add.  This
        method always sets m_stylesheetDoc to nullptr (after freeing it
        if necessary) and sets m_stylesheetDocTaken to false.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::parseString): Call
        clearXSLStylesheetDocument().  Prior to this, m_stylesheetDoc
        might be left pointing to a freed value, and this method could
        return early if xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt() failed.  Switch to
        using Checked<> to compute required buffer size to parse XSL
        stylesheet, and return early on overflow.  Clean up existing
        return statements to use boolean expressions.  Add nullptr check
        for m_parentStyleSheet->m_stylesheetDoc before using it.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::loadChildSheet): Get rid of local
        variable by calling loadSheet() from last array element.
        (WebCore::XSLStyleSheet::compileStyleSheet): Add debug assert
        that m_stylesheetDoc is not nullptr.

        -- Don't destroy incomplete decoded image frames for large images. This

        WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() should check !scriptController->isTerminatingExecution().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171775
        <rdar://problem/30975761>

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Currently, WorkerThread::stop() calls scheduleExecutionTermination() to terminate
        JS execution first, followed by posting a cleanup task to the worker, and lastly,
        it invokes terminate() on the WorkerRunLoop.

        As a result, before the run loop is terminated, the worker thread may observe the
        TerminatedExecutionException in JS code, bail out, see another JS task to run,
        re-enters the VM to run said JS code, and fails with an assertion due to the
        TerminatedExecutionException still being pending on VM entry.

        WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() already has a check to only allow a task to
        run if and only if !runLoop.terminated() and the task is not a clean up task.
        We'll fix the above race by changing WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() to check
        !context->script()->isTerminatingExecution() instead of !runLoop.terminated().
        Since WorkerThread::stop() always scheduleExecutionTermination() before it
        terminates the run loop, !context->script()->isTerminatingExecution() implies
        !runLoop.terminated().

        The only time that runLoop is terminated without scheduleExecutionTermination()
        being called is when WorkerThread::stop() is called before the WorkerThread has
        finished creating its WorkerGlobalScope.  In this scenario, WorkerThread::stop()
        will still terminate the run loop.  Hence, after the WorkerGlobalScope is created
        (in WorkerThread::workerThread()), we will check if the run loop has been
        terminated (i.e. stop() was called).  If so, we'll scheduleExecutionTermination()
        there, and guarantee that if runloop.terminated() is true, then
        context->script()->isTerminatingExecution() is also true.

        Solutions that were considered but did not work (recorded for future reference):

        1. In WorkerThread::stop(), call scheduleExecutionTermination() only after it
           posts the cleanup task and terminate the run loop.

           This did not work because this creates a race where the worker thread may run
           the cleanup task before WorkerThread::stop() finishes.  As a result, the
           scriptController may be deleted before we get to invoke scheduleExecutionTermination()
           on it, thereby resulting in a use after free.

           To make this work, we would have to change the life cycle management strategy
           of the WorkerScriptController.  This is a more risky change that we would
           want to take on at this time, and may also not be worth the gain.

        2. Break scheduleExecutionTermination() up into 2 parts i.e. WorkerThread::stop()
           will:
           1. set the scriptControllers m_isTerminatingExecution flag before
              posting the cleanup task and terminating the run loop, and
           2. invoke VM::notifyNeedsTermination() after posting the cleanup task and
              terminating the run loop.

           This requires that we protect the liveness of the VM until we can invoke
           notifyNeedsTermination() on it.

           This did not work because:
           1. We may end up destructing the VM in WorkerThread::stop() i.e. in the main
              web frame, but only the worker thread holds the JS lock for the VM.

              We can make the WorkerThread::stop() acquire the JS lock just before it
              releases the protected VM's RefPtr, but that would mean the main thread
              may be stuck waiting a bit for the worker thread to release its JSLock.
              This is not desirable.

           2. In practice, changing the liveness period of the Worker VM relative to its
              WorkerScriptController and WorkerGlobalScope also has unexpected
              ramifications.  We observed many worker tests failing with assertion
              failures and crashes due to this change.

           Hence, this approach is also a more risky change than it appears on the
           surface, and is not worth exploring at this time.

        In the end, changing WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() to check for
        !scriptController->isTerminatingExecution() is the most straight forward solution
        that is easy to prove correct.

        Also fixed a race in WorkerThread::workerThread() where it can delete the
        WorkerGlobalScope while WorkerThread::stop() is in the midst of accessing it.
        We now guard the the nullifying of m_workerGlobalScope with the
        m_threadCreationAndWorkerGlobalScopeMutex as well.

        UPDATE: the only new thing in this patch for re-landing (vs one previously landed)
        is that instead of nullifying m_workerGlobalScope directly (thereby deleting the
        WorkerGlobalScope context), we'll swap it out and delete it only after we've
        unlocked the m_threadCreationAndWorkerGlobalScopeMutex.  This is needed because
        the destruction of the WorkerGlobalScope will cause the main thread to race against
        the worker thread to delete the WorkerThread object, and the WorkerThread object
        owns the mutex that we need to unlock after nullifying the m_workerGlobalScope
        field.

        This issue is covered by an existing test that I just unskipped in TestExpectations.

        Elements should be inserted into a template element as its content's last child
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171373
        <rdar://problem/31862949>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Before this change, our HTML parser obeys the following premises:
        1) A fostering child whose parent is a table should be inserted before its parent and under its grandparent.
        2) When inserting into a template element, an element should be inserted into its content.

        Let's walk through the example:
        a) Before eventhandler takes place
        template
        table
            svg <- parser
        b) After eventhandler takes place
        template
            table
                svg <- parser
        c) after parsing svg
        template
            content
                svg
                (table)
            table

        Finally, in the example, the svg element will be inserted into the content of the template element while
        having its next sibling point to the table element. However, the table element is actually under the
        template element not its content.

        This messy tree is constructed because the second premise is incompleted. It should be: When inserting into
        a template element, an element should be inserted into its content as its last child.
        Quoted from Step 3 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#appropriate-place-for-inserting-a-node
        A correct tree will then looks like:
        template
            content
                svg
            table

        Make getBoundingClientRect() and getClientRects() return rects which are relative to the layout
        viewport, rather than the visual viewport. This goes part of the way to fixing webkit.org/b/170981,
        which aims to make pinch-zoom invisible to web pages ("inert visual viewport"). It fixes issues on various
        sites like Facebook when zoomed.

        Factor coordinate conversion code into functions on FrameView, which now documents
        the various coordinate systems in a big comment. Document::adjustFloatQuadsForScrollAndAbsoluteZoomAndFrameScale()

        to use these helpers.

        There are two behavior changes here:

        1. FrameView::documentToClientOffset() now uses the origin of the layout viewport in the "document to client"
           coordinate mapping.
           
        2. The two document functions would apply the scale and offset in the wrong order. We need
           to first undo the effects of CSS zoom, page zoom and page scale, and then map from document
           to client coordinates.

        WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() should check !scriptController->isTerminatingExecution().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171775
        <rdar://problem/30975761>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        Currently, WorkerThread::stop() calls scheduleExecutionTermination() to terminate
        JS execution first, followed by posting a cleanup task to the worker, and lastly,
        it invokes terminate() on the WorkerRunLoop.

        As a result, before the run loop is terminated, the worker thread may observe the
        TerminatedExecutionException in JS code, bail out, see another JS task to run,
        re-enters the VM to run said JS code, and fails with an assertion due to the
        TerminatedExecutionException still being pending on VM entry.

        WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() already has a check to only allow a task to
        run if and only if !runLoop.terminated() and the task is not a clean up task.
        We'll fix the above race by changing WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() to check
        !context->script()->isTerminatingExecution() instead of !runLoop.terminated().
        Since WorkerThread::stop() always scheduleExecutionTermination() before it
        terminates the run loop, !context->script()->isTerminatingExecution() implies
        !runLoop.terminated().

        The only time that runLoop is terminated without scheduleExecutionTermination()
        being called is when WorkerThread::stop() is called before the WorkerThread has
        finished creating its WorkerGlobalScope.  In this scenario, WorkerThread::stop()
        will still terminate the run loop.  Hence, after the WorkerGlobalScope is created
        (in WorkerThread::workerThread()), we will check if the run loop has been
        terminated (i.e. stop() was called).  If so, we'll scheduleExecutionTermination()
        there, and guarantee that if runloop.terminated() is true, then
        context->script()->isTerminatingExecution() is also true.

        Solutions that were considered but did not work (recorded for future reference):

        1. In WorkerThread::stop(), call scheduleExecutionTermination() only after it
           posts the cleanup task and terminate the run loop.

           This did not work because this creates a race where the worker thread may run
           the cleanup task before WorkerThread::stop() finishes.  As a result, the
           scriptController may be deleted before we get to invoke scheduleExecutionTermination()
           on it, thereby resulting in a use after free.

           To make this work, we would have to change the life cycle management strategy
           of the WorkerScriptController.  This is a more risky change that we would
           want to take on at this time, and may also not be worth the gain.

        2. Break scheduleExecutionTermination() up into 2 parts i.e. WorkerThread::stop()
           will:
           1. set the scriptControllers m_isTerminatingExecution flag before
              posting the cleanup task and terminating the run loop, and
           2. invoke VM::notifyNeedsTermination() after posting the cleanup task and
              terminating the run loop.

           This requires that we protect the liveness of the VM until we can invoke
           notifyNeedsTermination() on it.

           This did not work because:
           1. We may end up destructing the VM in WorkerThread::stop() i.e. in the main
              web frame, but only the worker thread holds the JS lock for the VM.

              We can make the WorkerThread::stop() acquire the JS lock just before it
              releases the protected VM's RefPtr, but that would mean the main thread
              may be stuck waiting a bit for the worker thread to release its JSLock.
              This is not desirable.

           2. In practice, changing the liveness period of the Worker VM relative to its
              WorkerScriptController and WorkerGlobalScope also has unexpected
              ramifications.  We observed many worker tests failing with assertion
              failures and crashes due to this change.

           Hence, this approach is also a more risky change than it appears on the
           surface, and is not worth exploring at this time.

        In the end, changing WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() to check for
        !scriptController->isTerminatingExecution() is the most straight forward solution
        that is easy to prove correct.

        Also fixed a race in WorkerThread::workerThread() where it can delete the
        WorkerGlobalScope while WorkerThread::stop() is in the midst of accessing it.
        We now guard the the nullifying of m_workerGlobalScope with the
        m_threadCreationAndWorkerGlobalScopeMutex as well.

        When an AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer is disconnected from the CA renderer, none of its samples will be decoded
        and enqueued for rendering. Once the layer is attached to a renderer again, it's stuffed full of samples which
        will never be decoded as their decode time has long passed.

        Pass the visibility state of the element through to the MediaPlayer so that MediaPlayerPrivateMediaStreamAVFObjC

        [GTK] GIF images are not properly loaded the first time
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170432

        Reviewed by Carlos Alberto Lopez Perez.

        When the GIF image is loaded for the first time, it's always read from the network, and the decoder is usually
        fetched with chunks of data. Then the data is cached in disk by the network process, so that when loaded from
        the cache, the whole encoded data is available to fetch the encoder. The problem is that we are failing to
        decode the image when giving chunks of data, that's why it only happens the first time loaded. If the first
        chunk of data provided is enough to get some metadata, including the size, but not frame contents, the load fails
        in CachedImage::addIncrementalDataBuffer() because the EncodedDataStatus reported is SizeAvailable but
        Image::isNull() returns true. An Image is considered to be Null when its size is empty, and the size is
        calculated always using the first frame in ImageFrameCache. Since we still don't have frames, the image is
        always Null in this case. It is not expected that EncodedDataStatus returns SizeAvailable and the image is Null,
        that's why it's considered an error and the load finishes with a decode error. However, the non CG ImageDecoder
        has a m_size member to handle this particular case, and it's when m_size is set when EncodedDataStatus changes
        to SizeAvailable. We should return the ImageEncoder size as the ImageSize when we have a decoder but
        not frames yet.

        WorkerThread::stop() should call scheduleExecutionTermination() last.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171775
        <rdar://problem/30975761>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Currently, WorkerThread::stop() calls scheduleExecutionTermination() to terminate
        JS execution first, followed by posting a cleanup task to the worker, and lastly,
        it invokes terminate() on the WorkerRunLoop.

        As a result, before run loop is terminate, the worker thread may observe the
        TerminatedExecutionException in JS code, bail out, see another JS task to run,
        re-enters the VM to run said JS code, and fails with an assertion due to the
        TerminatedExecutionException still being pending on VM entry.

        WorkerRunLoop::Task::performTask() already has a check to only allow a task to
        run if and only if !runLoop.terminated() and the task is not a clean up task.
        We'll fix the above race by ensuring that having WorkerThread::stop() terminate
        the run loop before it scheduleExecutionTermination() which throws the
        TerminatedExecutionException.  This way, by the time JS code unwinds out of the
        VM due to the TerminatedExecutionException, runLoop.terminated() is guaranteed
        to be true and thereby prevents re-entry into the VM.

        Currently, WorkerThread::stop() calls scheduleExecutionTermination() to terminate

        it invokes terminate() on the WorkerRunLoop.

        As a result, before run loop is terminate, the worker thread may observe the
        TerminatedExecutionException in JS code, bail out, see another JS task to run,
        re-enters the VM to run said JS code, and fails with an assertion due to the
        TerminatedExecutionException still being pending on VM entry.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Simplify relationship between Attr and Element now that Attr is childless
        after r216259.

        No new tests, no Web facing behavior change.

        * dom/Attr.cpp:
        (WebCore::Attr::setValue):
        Attr::setValue() was only called by Element::setAttributeInternal() to make sure
        we updated the Attr node's Text child. However, now that Attr has no Text child,
        Element no longer needs to update the Attr node's value.
        Attr::setValueForBindings() was thus renamed to setValue(). Its implementation
        was also simplified by calling Element::setAttribute() on its ownerElement, if
        it has one, instead of duplicating a bunch of code from Element::setAttributeInternal().

        (WebCore::Attr::setNodeValue):
        Call setValue() instead of setValueForBindings() now that it has been renamed.

        * dom/Attr.h:
        * dom/Attr.idl:
        Rename valueForBindings / setValueForBindings to value / setValue.

        * dom/Document.h:
        Split shouldInvalidateNodeListAndCollectionCaches() into 2 methods, one taking an Attr name
        and another that does not. There are now 2 calls sites instead of one, so we no longer need
        to branch in this function.

        * dom/Element.cpp:
        (WebCore::Element::setAttributeInternal):
        Drop code calling Attr::setValue() on the Attr node since Attr::setValue() was only
        duplicating logic from Element::setAttributeInternal() after r216259. There is nothing
        on Attr that needs updating when an element attribute gets updated.

        (WebCore::Element::attributeChanged):
        Call the new invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestorsForAttribute(). This
        is the only call site that passes an attribute name.

        * dom/Node.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::shouldInvalidateNodeListAndCollectionCaches):
        (WebCore::Document::shouldInvalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesForAttribute):

        (WebCore::Node::invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestors):
        (WebCore::Node::invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestorsForAttribute):
        - invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestors() used to invalidate childNodeLists
          if the Node was an attribute node. Drop this as this is no longer needed as of r216259.
        - After the change to Attr::setValue(), call sites for
          invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestors() either had no parameters, or both
          parameters present and non-null. There is therefore no longer any need to handle
          having an attrName but no attributeOwnerElement. To make this obvious, I split this
          into 2 methods: invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestors() and
          invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestorsForAttribute(attrName). We no longer
          need the attributeOwnerElement parameter as it was only used to exit early.

        The problem here is that our animation code is tied to renderers. We don't have renderers during
        the initial style resolution so animations are not applied yet. When constructing renderers we set
        their style to the initial animated style but this step can't implement inheritance.

        Normally this is invisible as the first animation frame will immediately inherit the style correctly.
        However in this case the animation is discrete and the first frame is the same as the initial state.
        With r207372 we optimize the descendant style change away.

        This patch fixes the problem by tracking that the renderer has initial animated style and inheriting
        it to descendants during next style resolution even if it doesn't change.

        This code was added in r203252 as part of a patch improving the handling of

        pre-layout of orthogonal boxes in FrameView. That is not true in the case of WebKit so we do
        not need this code at all. Actually it was causing incorrect renderings in some tests.

        Certain SVG filters should only be allowed to operate

        this by including a flag in PaintInfo and LayerPaintingInfo,
        and have RenderWidget make sure the documents have acceptable
        SecurityOrigins as it goes to paint.

        This could be used as the first step in a "safe painting"
        strategy, allowing some content to be rendered into a 
        canvas or via the element() CSS function... but it is only

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The CSS Box Alignment specification defines the <content-distribution>
        set as some of the allowed values for the Content Distribution
        properties, align-content and justify-content. The 'space-evenly' value
        is not among the ones allowed for these properties according to the CSS
        Flexible Box specification.

        The CSS Flexbible box specification states that it must follow the CSS
        Box Alignment specification, so this new value must be considered as
        part of an upgraded level of the spec, which should be implemented
        eventually.

        Since we have already shipped an implementation of the new CSS Box
        Alignment values for CSS Grid Layout, we need to implement it for

        font-stretch: normal selects expanded fonts instead of condensed fonts

        CSS Fonts level 3 says: "If the value of ‘font-stretch’ is ‘normal’ or one of the condensed
        values, narrower width values are checked first, then wider values."

        CSS Fonts level 4 erroneously was incompatible with this, but was updated in
        https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/commit/4559389d183bbaaf3321af5ba1c924caa7c488bb
        to be consistent with this.

        Now, CSS Fonts level 4 states: "If the desired stretch value is less than or equal to100,
        stretch values below the desired stretch value are checked in descending order followed by
        stretch values above the desired stretch value in ascending order"

        Handle IDLPromise<> properly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166752

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        This patch implements WebIDL Promise type conversion. According to the spec,
        Promise takes a value and convert it to Promise by using Promise.resolve function.
        We implement JSPromise::resolve in JSC and use it in JSDOMConvertPromise.

        In conversion phase, we just convert the value to JSC::JSPromise* and hold it in
        PromiseRejectionEvent. On the other hand, In this patch, we newly introduce a new
        type DOMPromise and use it in RejectedPromiseTracker. And we also rename the previous
        DOMPromise to DOMPromiseDeferred since it is corresponding to JSPromiseDeferred.
        DOMPromise is DOMGuarded object. So it is strongly referenced from ScriptExecutionContext
        and it is weakly referenced from the object itself. This is important since Strong<JSPromise>
        reference in C++ object that has a wrapper (in this case, PromiseRejectionEvent) easily causes
        cyclic reference. We hold it as DOMPromise instead of Strong<JSPromise> in RejectedPromiseTracker
        to break the cyclic reference edge with weak reference.

        In the meantime, we still use JSC::Strong<> in PromiseRejectionEvent. It leaks memory if promise
        refers the wrapper object of PromiseRejectionEvent. CustomEvent also has the same problem.
        This is a general problem that `attribute any` can create cyclic reference. And they should be
        fixed in a different patch.

        Currently, we do not take the following approach. e.g. There is C++ object that represents Promise.
        And its wrapper object is JSPromise thing. When exposing the C++ object, it will be converted to a
        wrapper object. We do not take this approach because PromiseRejectionEvent can take user-provided promise.
        For example, users can create PromiseRejectionEvent in a form
        `new PromiseRejectionEvent("...", { promise: promise })`. In this case, `event.promise === promise`
        is required. And this is not suitable for the above C++ object model.

        Large part of this patch is mechanical one to replace DOMPromise with DOMPromiseDeferred.

        I believe WebKit had this because Attr used to have Text child nodes. Therefore, modifying
        those Text child nodes via the CharacterData API could modify the value of an attribute,
        requiring us to run attributeChangedCallback for Custom Elements. However, as of
        <https://trac.webkit.org/r216259>, Attr can no longer have Text child nodes.

        nativeSize regardless how big this size is. It turns out this is wrong. CG has an
        optimization to return a scaled down image if areaOf(nativeSize) is greater than
        some maximum value.
 
        This is not what we want for asynchronously image decoding. We want the decoded
        frame to have the size we ask for, not some scaled down frame. The fix is to pass
        always maxPixelSize to CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(). maxPixelSize will be
        equal to maxDimension(sizeForDrawing) if sizeForDrawing is valid it is less than
        maxDimension(nativeSize). Otherwise it will be equal to maxDimension(nativeSize).

        Simple line layout pre-measures space using the primary font,
        even if the space glyph requires a fallback font (and even if the string does not have a space in it at all).
        When this width gets cached (see WidthCache) we might end up using it later during normal line layout and
        it could produce incorrect layout.
        This patch removes the space width caching from Simple line layout, since Font already caches it.

        Set the Response.blob() type based on the content-type header value.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170849

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        There are two problems to fix here:

        1.  Currently the FetchResponse class only called updateContentType()
        when first created even though all the headers were not available.  This
        patch calls updateContentType() again after the headers are populated.

        2.  The fetch design requires propagating the normalized blob
        type to FetchBodyConsumer as well.  Currently this is only done if
        Response.blob() is called after the body is completely loaded.  If
        we hit the consumeOnceLoadingFinished() path, then the type is not
        passed.  This is similar to what was happening in bug 171489 with
        ReadableStream bodies.  This patch sets the type on the
        FetchBodyConsumer in consumeOnceLoadingFinished() as well.

        Theses changes allow WebKit to pass the "Consume response's body: from
        fetch to blob" case in the WPT response-consume.html test.

        Test: http://w3c-test.org/fetch/api/response/response-consume.html

        (WebCore::FetchResponse::BodyLoader::didReceiveResponse): Modified to
        call FetchBodyOwner::updateContentType() after filling m_headers.

        a blob.

        [iOS] REGRESSION (r209409): getBoundingClientRect is wrong for fixed-position elements in resize/orientationchange
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171140

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        WebPage::dynamicViewportSizeUpdate() is called during rotation, and does a layout which needs to have
        an up-to-date layout viewport, since the layout viewport state is detectable in orientationchange and
        resize events via fetching the client rect of fixed elements. Normally we send in the layout viewport
        from the UI process, but in this case we need to compute one in the web process. So factor code
        into FrameView to do the computation, called from both places.

        Emoji with Fitzpatrick modifiers need to take our complex text codepath. When looking through
        the string to determine which code path to use, we ask if a particular codepoint is an emoji
        group candidate. r213499 expanded the set of these candidates to include Fitzpatrick modifiers,
        which means the next "if" statement would never be hit. Instead, we should check that "if"

        any emoji group candidates.

        Attr Nodes should not have children
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171688
        <rdar://problem/31998412>

        Attr Nodes should not have children as per the latest DOM specification:
        - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-attr
        - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-attr-value
        - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-ensure-pre-insertion-validity (Step 1)

        Firefox and Chrome both have been matching the DOM specification for a while so I think
        we should do the same. This aligns us with other browsers, simplifies the code, is
        more efficient and the code being removed has been prone to security bugs.

        [Cocoa] Converting from WebCore::Cookie to NSHTTPCookie always marks cookies as secure
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171700
        <rdar://problem/32017975>

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        The function that we use to convert from WebCore::Cookie to NSHTTPCookie was
        misusing the NSHTTPCookieSecure property. If any value is provided for this key,
        even @NO, CFNetwork interprets that to mean that the cookie has the "secure" flag.
        Thus, in some cases we would store an "insecure" cookie on a site that uses the
        http:// protocol, and be unable to later retrieve the cookie. This is known to
        affect cookies set via WebCookieManager, WKHTTPCookieStore, and WebAutomationSession.

        This is covered by existing test WebKit2.WKHTTPCookieStore.
        The test had a bug that masked this problem.

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Adds a synchronousTimeout: argument to doAfterLoadingProvidedContentIntoFileURLs:. If a positive timeout
        interval is specified by the client, then we will block the main thread for at most that amount of time after
        beginning to load from the item providers.

        To do this, we introduce another `dispatch_group_t` in parallel to the `fileLoadingGroup` that is entered and
        left in the same places. However, instead of attaching a handler block, we simply perform a synchronous wait for
        either the time limit to be reached, or the item providers to finish loading.

        * dom/DocumentMarker.h:

        Introduces the DraggedContent DocumentMarker type, which applies to the Range in the DOM that is being used as
        a drag source. Also adds DraggedContentData, which contains nodes found by the TextIterator in the process of
        finding Ranges to mark.

        (WebCore::DocumentMarkerController::addDraggedContentMarker):
        (WebCore::shouldInsertAsSeparateMarker):
        (WebCore::DocumentMarkerController::addMarker):

        When adding DocumentMarkers of type DraggedContent, keep adjacent RenderReplaced elements separate, rather than
        merging them into existing RenderedDocumentMarkers. This is because the data for each of these (i.e. the target
        node) needs to be preserved.

        (WebCore::DocumentMarkerController::markersFor):

        Bail and return an empty list if the map of document markers cannot possibly contain a dragged content marker.

        * dom/DocumentMarkerController.h:
        * page/DragController.h:
        * page/DragState.h:

        Add draggedContentRange to DragState. This tracks the Range that is being dragged; it is created when the drag
        session has begun, and ends when drag session finishes (either via WebPage::dragEnded or WebPage::dragCancelled).

        * page/EventHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::repaintContentsOfRange):
        (WebCore::EventHandler::dragCancelled):

        Called when a drag is cancelled in the UI process without a session ever getting a chance to begin. We use this
        as a hook to remove all DraggedContent document markers from the document of the dragged content range.

        (WebCore::EventHandler::didStartDrag):

        Called when a drag session has begun in the UI process. We use this as a hook to set up document markers for the
        Range of content being dragged.

        (WebCore::EventHandler::dragSourceEndedAt):

        Called when a drag session ends. We use this as a hook to remove all DraggedContent document markers from the
        document of the dragged content range.

        * page/EventHandler.h:
        * page/FocusController.cpp:
        (WebCore::shouldClearSelectionWhenChangingFocusedElement):

        Prevent the selection from clearing when the previously focused element is editable and also contains the drag
        source element. Ideally, we should experiment with clearing out the selection whenever the element is blurred
        (and not have additional restrictions on editability and containing the drag source), but this change is much
        riskier.

        (WebCore::FocusController::setFocusedElement):
        * rendering/InlineTextBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::InlineTextBox::paint):

        Use RenderText::draggedContentStartEnd to find the range of text (if any) that is dragged content, and paint
        these ranges of text at a lower alpha using TextPainter::paintTextInRange.

        * rendering/RenderReplaced.cpp:
        (WebCore::draggedContentContainsReplacedElement):

        Determines whether or not the element being rendered is contained within a dragged content range. Assuming that
        the DraggedContent type flag is set in DocumentMarkerController, we first look to see whether or not the
        container node is in the document marker map. If so, instead of consulting node offset ranges (since this is, in
        the worst-case, linear in the number of sibling nodes per RenderReplaced) we simply check the DraggedContentData
        to see if the current element being rendered matches one of the target nodes.

        (WebCore::RenderReplaced::paint):

        If the element rendered by this RenderReplaced is dragged content, then render it at a low alpha.

        * rendering/RenderText.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderText::draggedContentRangesBetweenOffsets):

        Determines what range of text, if any, contains dragged content by consulting the Document's DocumentMarkers.

        * rendering/RenderText.h:
        * rendering/TextPainter.cpp:
        (WebCore::TextPainter::paintTextInRange):

        * rendering/TextPainter.h:

        Add TextPainter support for specifying special text offset ranges when rendering a TextRun, such that each

        In TextTrackLoader::processNewCueData() and PNGImageReader::decode() we changed the patter to read data from a
        SharedBuffer at a given offset. The new pattern is not correct, because it assumes the whole segment is always
        read, and the new offset is not correct when that's not the case. This has broken the rendering of png images in
        the GTK+ port, only the first bytes are correctly decoded and drawn, but not the rest of the image.

        When creating a AVAudioSessionCaptureDevice, set the device's enabled state to true if the port description
        has any items in its dataSources property (which is the best analogue to "isActive" we have in AVAudioSession).

        Also, when creating the generic list of CaptureDevices, use the copy constructor to ensure the enabled state

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        FontCascade::getGlyphsAndAdvancesForComplexText() is tasked with calculating paint advances for a
        subrange of RTL text. It does this by creating a ComplexTextController, telling it to iterate to
        the beginning of the subrange (outputting to a GlyphBuffer), then telling it to iterate to the end
        of the subrange (outputting to another GlyphBuffer). Because the text is RTL, the sum of the
        advances gathered so far is the distance from the right edge of the text to the left edge of the
        subrange (because we advance in logical order). Therefore, the x-coordinate we are at now is the
        total width minus the sum of both of the GlyphBuffers. For some reason, when I wrote this code I
        forgot to add in the contribution from the first GlyphBuffer. Unfortunately, this particular
        codepath is rarely hit in practice and completely untested, which made me miss it when I wrote it.

        I was unfortunately unable to reproduce the flaky crash locally. However, the crash trace
        indicates that one of the EventTarget::scriptExecutionContext() overrides is returning a
        stale ScriptExecutionContext pointer. Since a GenericEventQueue is involved, the EventTarget
        is likely a media-related object. I therefore audited media classes that override
        EventTarget::scriptExecutionContext() and found several that look unsafe. I am fixing those
        by having them override ContextDestructionObserver, instead of having a raw
        ScriptExecutionContext pointer member. This makes sure the pointer gets nulled out whenever
        the scriptexecutioncontext gets destroyed, ensuring that those classes's
        EventTarget::scriptExecutionContext() overrides can never return a stale pointer.

        The Fetch API specification requires setting the blob contentType

        actually a ReadableStream.

        Document style resolvers should share user rulesets
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171549

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Large user stylesheets (like those used by ad blockers) can end up using lots of memory if
        a document uses large number of shadow trees. User style is inherently per-document and
        the resulting rulesets can be shared between the document and the shadow trees.

        [GStreamer] Dailymotion live stream videos don't play
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170767

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        The video shows a message saying that an error occurred and nothing is played. There are actually several
        problems with dailymotion. The main issue is that URLs are redirected by the server, and GStreamer needs to
        know the redirected URL. Once GStreamer knows the redirected URL the error message no longer appears, the video
        starts but it always stops after a few seconds. This is because the source receives an early EOS while still
        downloading the fragments. The reason of the early EOS is because dailymotion sends a wrong Content-Length header,
        something that is expected to happen and we correctly handle that case when receiving the data, by updating the
        size accordingly if the bytes received are longer than the expected content length. This particular case
        doesn't work well with GStreamer automatic EOS handling, which is the default. At some point, GStreamer detects
        that the bytes received are at least the expected ones and emits a GST_EVENT_EOS that the GstUriDownloader
        handles finishing the download early. We should always disable automatic EOS, since we know when EOS actually
        happens and we already call gst_app_src_end_of_stream(). This patch also emits a GST_EVENT_CUSTOM_DOWNSTREAM_STICKY
        event to let GStreamer know about the HTTP headers sent and received.

        Implement WebCrypto ECDSA support for configurations that
        are using libgcrypt.

        For signing, the provided data is first hashed with the specified
        digest algorithm and embedded into a data s-expression. It's then
        passed to gcry_pk_sign() along with the private key, returning a
        sig-val s-expression. The r and s parameters are then retrieved from
        that sig-val and their data extracted and concatenated in the output
        Vector<>.

        For verification, the data is again hashed and embedded into a data
        s-expression. The r and s parameters are extracted from the passed-in
        signature Vector<> and embedded into a sig-val s-expression. The data
        and sig-val s-expressions are then passed to gcry_pk_verify() along
        with the public key. The verification succeeds if no error is returned
        and fails if the returned error code is GPG_ERR_BAD_SIGNATURE.

        Implement bit derivation support for the HKDF algorithm for configurations
        that use libgcrypt.

        libgcrypt doesn't provide HKDF support out of the box, so we have to
        implement the two steps manually. In the first one, we retrieve the
        pseudo-random key by using the specified MAC algorithm with the salt data
        as the key and the key data as the input keying material.

        In the expand step, we do the required amount of iterations to derive
        a sufficient amount of data, using the same MAC algorithm with the
        pseudo-random key from the previous step on the data we compose from the
        previous block data, the info data, and the current iteration value. The
        resulting blocks are appended together until they can be clipped to the
        desired output length.

        Add audio device change notifications to AudioSession.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171403

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Add notifications to AudioSession which fire when the current input and output audio devices
        change. Also add a notification when audio services are lost (which will only fire on iOS).
        Take this opportunity to make the existing hardwareMutedStateDidChange() notification be
        platform agnostic, to move the outputDeviceSupportsLowPowerMode() code from AudioHardwareListener,
        and to do a few more clean-ups of the AudioSession code.

        Initialize a new layout state while bailing out of simple line layout only when needed.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171481
        <rdar://problem/31906382>

        '-webkit-border-fit: lines' requires inline box tree.
        We normally bail out of simple line layout early when we see this property. 
        When this property is dynamically set and we already have a simple line layout context,
        RenderBlockFlow::ensureLineBoxes() takes care of the switch by calling layoutLineBoxes().
        This patch makes sure that we create the layout state for this (forced)line layout only when
        we don't yet have one.

        AX: Improve performance of addChildren()/childrenChanged()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171443

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        There's a lot of unnecessary work happening when childrenChanged() is being called.
        Some of the improvements here:
        1. When childrenChanged() is being called on some element, we are marking its parent
           chain dirty. However, in the addChild() method we are then clearing each child of
           that 'dirty' parent, eventually making the entire tree dirty. 
           Added a m_subTreeDirty flag and using the needsToUpdateChildren() check to make sure
           we are only clearing the right chain without updating the unchanged siblings.
        2. In the addChild() method we are calling accessibilityIsIgnored() on each child and that 
           might lead to going up the parent chain again to get necessary information. 
           Since we are already traversing the tree from top to bottom to add children, added a 
           struct to store the information and pass it to the child so to avoid unnecessary traversal.
        3. Reduced the amount work of ARIA text controls perform when updating its parents in childrenChanged() 
           so that we don't update a big portion of the tree while typing.

        No new tests since this didn't change any functionality.

        AX: ARIA "region" role which lacks an accessible name should not be treated as a landmark
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171180

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Remove mapping of LandmarkRegionRole for regions which lack an accessible name.
        Doing so had a side effect of causing a number of DPub ARIA roles to stop being
        mapped as ARIA landmarks. This is due to our internal role mappings, namely
        treating the DPub ARIA landmark roles as if they were regions. Because DPub's
        landmarks do not subclass region, and do not have the same name-from-author
        requirement as region, create a new LandmarkDocRegionRole AccessibilityRole and
        map DPub ARIA's generic landmarks to it.

        No new tests because we already have sufficient coverage. Several existing
        tests were given additional test cases to cover named and unnamed regions,
        and test expectations updated accordingly.

          The "or a non-separator" part is new in the spec (step 3.6.1) and is now implemented.
        - After looking for the '=', only treat what follows as a value if the current character

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        There is a wrong situation in the image decoders where the complete data has been assigned
        to them but the size of the image hasn't been decoded yet. This is causing rendering
        issues in webgl when decoding the images used as textures. To fix this, we refactor how the
        encoded data status is stored to avoid that situation: the status is handled completely
        by ImageDecoder.h, and it's the one forcing the decode of the size when data gets assigned
        to the decoders.

        Align colspan/rowspan limits with the latest HTML specification after:

        The following changes were made:
        - Our rowspan limit was raised from 8190 to 65534
        - A colspan limit of 1000 was introduced. Blink has UseCounter data showing that
          colspans over 1000 are extremely rare and Gecko has data showing that when we
          get a colspan greater than 1000, it is usually a bug. Therefore, this change
          should be fine.
        - The limits are now properly reflected via the IDL attributes instead of lying
          to the Web about the colspan / rowspan we are using internally.

        REGRESSION(r213764): Async decoding of animated images is disabled for ImageDocument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170333

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The way the image drawing settings are transfered from the Settings to
        BitmapImage is problematic. The drawing settings are retrieved from the
        CachedImageObserver which store them in the constructor only if the
        CachedImage as a loader. In the case of ImageDocument, there isn't loader
        set in CachedImage so the settings of ImageDocument are not set. Also
        the CachedImage can be used after loading by another document which may
        have a different drawing settings.

        The fix is to make BitmapImage reads the drawing settings every time it 
        is drawn as a foreground or background image in a RenderElement.

        Reviewed by Andy Estes.

        Frame.h has several std::unique_ptrs that are created in the constructor, never null,
        and destroyed in the destructor.  This is what WTF::UniqueRef is for, and using UniqueRef
        allows us to not check for null values because a UniqueRef can never be null.
        An interesting case was the EventHandler, which we explicitly set to nullptr in the destructor
        of MainFrame, a subclass of Frame.  We added this in r199181 to fix a crash tested by
        fast/events/wheel-event-destroys-frame.html and this improved lifetime also does not crash
        or assert in that test.

        Using UniqueRef also requires const correctness, which this patch adds when necessary.

        Before the patch, we are setting the channel handler client to null and then unregistering from observer to
        libwebrtc data channel. Since this happens in two different threads, there might be a timing issue.

        Removing this risk by first unregistering (done synchronously on the other thread), before setting client to null.
        Made some clean-up related refactoring.

        [ATK] Implement support for new ARIA 1.1 values of aria-haspopup
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171164

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        In ARIA 1.1, aria-haspopup's value type changed from true/false to a token.
        Values: true, false (default, unless it's a combobox), dialog, grid, listbox
        (default for combobox), menu, and tree. Any value of aria-haspopup that is
        not included in the list of allowed values, including an empty string, must
        be treated as if the value false had been provided.

        Add AccessibilityObject::ariaPopupValue() to validate the value, handle implicit
        values, and give platform assistive technologies a means to access that value.

        If there is a valid, non-false value of aria-haspopup, include ATK_STATE_HAS_POPUP
        in the AtkStateSet. Lastly, expose the value (rather than true/false) via the "haspop"
        AtkObject attribute.

        [css-grid] Remove most of the usage of SizingOperation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171225

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        SizingOperation was added as a way to modify the behaviour of the track sizing algorithm
        with the specifics for intrinsic size computations. The problem is that although intrinsic
        size computation does imply indefinite sizes, the opposite is not always true. For example,
        a grid container with height:auto would compute the row sizes with an indefinite size but is
        not part of the intrinsic size (preferred widths) computation.

        That's why it was wrongly used in some parts of the current code, in most of the cases is
        more than enough to check whether the available space is indefinite or not. In order to do
        that we have to keep both available sizes (height & width) around all the time to properly
        support orthogonal flows.

        This change does not imply any change in behaviour.

        [GCrypt] CryptoKeyRSA: implement create(), keySizeInBits(), buildAlgorithm(), exportData()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171213

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        CryptoKeyRSA::create() validates the specified key type along with the
        provided data. If everything is OK, it then proceeds to build the key
        of the appropriate type through an s-expression that is constructed with
        the necessary data. We don't currently support creating private keys
        with any additional prime information (apart from p and q).

        CryptoKeyRSA::keySizeInBits() calls the helper getRSAModulusLength()
        function that find the modulus MPI in the key s-expression and returns
        the modulus data length in bits.

        CryptoKeyRSA::buildAlgorithm() returns KeyAlgorithm that's constructed
        from the appropriate name, this key's modulus length, and this key's
        public exponent data. It also specifies the hash if there is such a
        restriction for this key.

        CryptoKeyRSA::exportData() returns a properly-constructed
        CryptoKeyDataRSAComponents object. The public modulus and exponent are
        used in case the key is public. If the key is private, the secret
        exponent and the p and q prime numbers are retrieved in MPI format.
        They're then used to calculate the dp, dq and qi parameters that are
        exported in the JWK format. Note that libgcrypt internally switches
        the p and q prime numbers such that p < q, but the Web Crypto
        specification and the dependant RFCs expect that q < p. We address
        this by simply switching the roles of the two primes and follow the
        usual q < p assumption when exporting the primes and computing the
        dependant exponents and coefficients.

        No new tests -- existing ones cover this but don't work yet due to missing
        RSA-related CryptoAlgorithm implementations.

        JSArray::isArrayPrototypeIteratorProtocolFastAndNonObservable is wrong because it does not do the necessary checks on the base object
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171150
        <rdar://problem/31771880>

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        This patch moves the sequence converters to use the now fixed
        JSArray::isArrayPrototypeIteratorProtocolFastAndNonObservable test
        inside JSC.
        
        This patch also fixes a few bugs:
        1. Converting to a sequence of numbers must prove that the JSArray
        is filled only with Int32/Double. If there is a chance the array
        contains objects, the conversion to a numeric IDLType can be observable
        (via valueOf()), and can change the iterator protocol.
        2. There are other conversions that can have side effects a-la valueOf().
        This patch introduces a new static constant in the various Converter
        classes that tell the sequence converter if the conversion operation
        can have JS side effects. If it does have side effects, we fall back to
        the generic conversion that uses the iterator protocol. If not, we can
        do a faster version that iterates over each element of the array,
        reading it directly, and converting it.

        Respect fidelity order when reading web content from item providers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171155
        <rdar://problem/31356937>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, when reading web content from pasteboards, we assume the old UIPasteboard/NSPasteboard model wherein
        the destination must determine which of the items is considered to have the highest fidelity for the purposes of
        inserting into an editable area. This destination-side fidelity ranking is determined solely by the NSArray
        returned from Pasteboard::supportedPasteboardTypes, which lists compatible types in order from highest fidelity
        to lowest fidelity. Pasteboard::read effectively iterates over this list of types in order, attempting to read
        highest fidelity types and bailing when it first successfully reads data.

        However, when our pasteboard is backed by UIItemProviders, we should instead read pasteboard types in order of
        fidelity as specified by the source rather than the destination. To accomplish this, we introduce an alternate
        codepath, Pasteboard::readRespectingUTIFidelities, which we take if Pasteboard::respectsUTIFidelities is true
        (currently, this only applies for the purposes of data interaction). This version follows a different flow:
        for each item in the pasteboard, we ask for just the UTIs for that item, in order of fidelity. For each item,
        we then call readPasteboardWebContentDataForType to try and read data for that type, continuing until either
        all UTIs have been attempted, or reading was successful.

        This patch makes two additional adjustments. First, we introduce Pasteboard::getTypesByFidelityForItemAtIndex,
        which is used by Pasteboard::readRespectingUTIFidelities when querying the list of supported UTIs for each
        pasteboard item, sorted by highest to lowest fidelity.

        Secondly, we refactor logic to write to the item provider pasteboard in PlatformPasteboardIOS. Since we are
        now respecting fidelity rankings on the destination, the source must also register UTI types in the right
        fidelity order. While this was mostly achieved using our existing method of writing a list of object
        representations to the pasteboard and then all of the contents of a NSString => NSData dictionary containing
        private UTI data, this approach has two flaws:
        1.  We are unable to register high-priority custom types, followed by representing objects, followed by more
            lower-priority custom types, since we assume that all custom types follow all representing objects.
        2.  Since we're just iterating over a dictionary of NSString => NSData when registering custom UTI
            representations to the item provider, there cannot inherently be any fidelity ordering for custom types.

        To address both of these issues, we introduce two new objects that encapsulate how we register data to the item
        provider pasteboard. WebItemProviderRegistrationInfo represents some data that can be registered to an item
        provider (either an object conforming to UIItemProviderWriting, or an NSString and NSData).
        WebItemProviderRegistrationInfoList represents a list of WebItemProviderRegistrationInfos in order of highest to
        lowest fidelity. In PlatformPasteboardIOS, we transform PasteboardWebContent, PasteboardImage, and PasteboardURL
        into a WebItemProviderRegistrationInfoList, which we then pass along to the WebItemProviderPasteboard. In
        WebItemProviderPasteboard, we traverse the list of WebItemProviderRegistrationInfos in the list and register
        each WebItemProviderRegistrationInfo's representing object or data to the item provider.

        After r214503, we would frequently crash when scrolling giphy pages because we were failing to call
        RenderView::removeRendererWithPausedImageAnimations(renderer, cachedImage) in some cases. This would
        cause a RenderElement to still be associated to a CachedImage in RenderView but not in practice.
        If the CachedImage then gets destroyed and the user scrolls, we end up calling
        RenderElement::repaintForPausedImageAnimationsIfNeeded() with a bad CachedImage.

        StyleCachedImage was properly calling RenderView::removeRendererWithPausedImageAnimations() before
        unregistering the renderer as a client to the CachedImage. However, RenderImageResource was failing
        to do the same. To make this less error-prone, I added a didRemoveCachedImageClient(CachedImage&)
        function to the CachedImageClient interface. It is overriden in RenderElement only to call

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170956

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        SharedBuffer was a mess of different data structures added over the years.
        SharedBuffer::append would allocate large Vector<char>s and call memcpy, and that
        is inefficient and causes crashes when large allocations fail, and the allocations
        and copies aren't even necessary.  There were also const correctness problems in
        ResourceLoader::addDataOrBuffer, and iterating a SharedBuffer was strange because
        sometimes we don't want to add unnecessary copies.

        These problems are solved by making SharedBuffer a Vector of read-only data segments,
        which can be contained in various ways but we don't care because all we want to do is
        read them.  Appending SharedBuffers is now const correct because we just add to a
        Vector<Ref<DataSegment>> and neither SharedBuffer can write to the data.  Sometimes,
        though, we want all the data to be in continuous memory, and if there are multiple
        segments then the data needs to be copied once to a new segment.  We should audit the
        call sites of SharedBuffer::data and see if this is really necessary.

        No change in functional behavior.  Fewer copies of the data are made when buffering
        data in the NetworkProcess.  No extra memory is allocated for bytes we think we might
        need to append in the future.  Data is now only copied into one buffer lazily as needed,
        which could slightly change when small delays from memcpy happen, but it's an overall
        improvement.  We could have a performance hit if we were to call append() then data()
        then append() then data() etc. but that doesn't happen in WebKit because we call append
        repeatedly when buffering the data then call data() once when reading the data.

        Currently, DragController::canProcessDrag bails immediately with `false` if the drag data does not contain
        compatible content. However, if we are dragging over a file input, we want the presence of files in the drag
        data to take priority. To fix this, we teach DragData::containsCompatibleContent to take the purpose of the drag
        into account (by default, this is Editing, but when dragging over a file input, this becomes FileUpload). We
        then consider DragData to have compatible content for the purpose of file uploading if it contains any files.

        This patch reduces redundant text measuring for mid-word breaking by
        1. Adjusting the range for the binary search when the text fragment is longer than the available width
        2. Preserving the width value for the left side of the split fragment (computed during the binary search) so
        that when the fragment is being split we don't need to re-measure it
        3. Checking if the right side fits the next line and only adjust the width (by re-measuring the text) for
        kerning/ligature if it does (if it does not fit, we'll end up re-measuring some part of it
        during the next split)

        [MediaCapture][iOS] AVAudioSession must be active and the correct category before IO AudioUnits start producing data.

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        If an input audio unit is asked to start before the AVAudioSession is in a recording category and active,
        CoreAudio will return an error stating that no input device is available.

        The PlatformMediaSessionManager will automatically set the category of and activate the AVAudioSession when one
        of its associated MediaStreams has a capturing RealtimeMediaSource and is currently producing data.  To solve
        the chicken-or-egg problem of activating the AVAudioSession before the source produces data, move the state bit
        of "producing data" directly into MediaStreams, and notify the PlatformMediaSessionManager that capturing is
        occurring after flipping that bit, but before asking the constituent tracks to begin producing data.

        In places (i.e. UserMediaRequest) where we previously told a stream's tracks to begin producing data, instead
        allow the stream to handle that by telling it to produce data directly.

        SharedBuffer was a mess of different data structures added over the years.
        SharedBuffer::append would allocate large Vector<char>s and call memcpy, and that
        is inefficient and causes crashes when large allocations fail, and the allocations
        and copies aren't even necessary.  There were also const correctness problems in
        ResourceLoader::addDataOrBuffer, and iterating a SharedBuffer was strange because
        sometimes we don't want to add unnecessary copies.

        These problems are solved by making SharedBuffer a Vector of read-only data segments,
        which can be contained in various ways but we don't care because all we want to do is
        read them.  Appending SharedBuffers is now const correct because we just add to a
        Vector<Ref<DataSegment>> and neither SharedBuffer can write to the data.  Sometimes,
        though, we want all the data to be in continuous memory, and if there are multiple
        segments then the data needs to be copied once to a new segment.  We should audit the
        call sites of SharedBuffer::data and see if this is really necessary.

        No change in functional behavior.  Fewer copies of the data are made when buffering
        data in the NetworkProcess.  No extra memory is allocated for bytes we think we might
        need to append in the future.  Data is now only copied into one buffer lazily as needed,
        which could slightly change when small delays from memcpy happen, but it's an overall
        improvement.  We could have a performance hit if we were to call append() then data()
        then append() then data() etc. but that doesn't happen in WebKit because we call append
        repeatedly when buffering the data then call data() once when reading the data.

        [MediaStream] Cleanup and simplify CoreAudioCaptureSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171064

        There is no need for a mutex to guard against internal state changes because we
        don't currently change configuration after the audio unit is allocated. Once
        we do support reconfiguration on the fly, we can just stop the output unit before
        changing configuration because the I/O proc isn't called if the output unit
        is stopped, and AudioOutputUnitStop blocks until the audio device has stopped.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171062
        <rdar://problem/31697835>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Tweaks DragController::draggableElement to traverse the DOM instead of the render tree when finding a draggable
        element. This prevents us from skipping elements that are in the DOM ancestor chain, but appear as siblings to
        the hit-tested node's renderer in the render tree.

        There was also previously a check to ensure that we skip anonymous RenderObjects while traversing up the chain,
        but this is no longer necessary fter this change, since all the elements we traverse in the DOM should have
        renderers that are not anonymous.

        [ATK] Implement support for DPub ARIA roles
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170679

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Create two new WebCore AccessibilityRole values: TextGroup and ApplicationTextGroup.
        These roles make it possible for platforms to distinguish groups which are primarily
        intended to display textual content from groups which are primarily intended to hold
        user-interface objects. Use these roles to fix the ATK mapping of DPub's groups, which
        should be exposed as ATK_ROLE_SECTION; not ATK_ROLE_PANEL.

        Modify the following WebCore AccessibilityRole mappings:
        - doc-abstract changed to ApplicationTextGroupRole because this DPub ARIA role does
          not subclass the ARIA landmark role
        - doc-biblioentry and doc-endnote changed to ListItemRole, because these DPub ARIA
          roles subclass the ARIA listitem role
        - doc-notice and doc-tip changed to DocumentNoteRole because these DPub ARIA roles
          subclass the ARIA note role
        - doc-pagebreak changed to SplitterRole because this DPub ARIA role subclasses the
          ARIA separator role

        No new tests required: New test cases were added to xml-roles-exposed.html, and
        the platform expectations for roles-exposed.html were updated to reflect the
        correct mappings.

        [WK2] Support DataTransfer::files() when performing a DHTML data interaction
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170880
        <rdar://problem/31314689>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Adds support for fetching files from the DataTransfer when performing a data interaction operation handled by
        JavaScript. There are two changes we make here to achieve this:

        First, we teach the Pasteboard on iOS to know what file paths hold the item provider contents used in the
        current data interaction operation. On iOS, Pasteboard::readFilenames is currently hard-coded to return an empty
        vector. To fix this, we add logic to the iOS Pasteboard to remember what the paths of all files that were
        successfully loaded from item providers as the data interaction is taking place. This ensures that at the
        WebCore layer, the implementation of Pasteboard::readFilenames on Mac and iOS is similar -- they both call out
        to the client layer in order to read file paths off of their respective pasteboards. Once in the client layer
        (WebKit1 or WebKit2) we then call into PlatformPasteboard::filenamesForDataInteraction, which then calls into
        WebItemProviderPasteboard if applicable.

        The second tweak is to propagate information about whether the document is preventing default data interaction
        behavior to the client layer. This prevents us from having to save pasteboard content when performing data
        interaction in cases where file information is not needed (i.e. the default behavior is being performed, and
        the target is not a file input). This also avoids compatibility issues with insertion animations when performing
        data interaction in editable areas, due to the extra time spent loading item provider data into a temporary
        file.

        Unit tests in <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170903>.

        or NonDefault, which indicates that the drop destination has explicitly prevented default.

        is cleaned up when list of item providers change (i.e. when the data interaction operation is finished, or if

        There was a race between didAssociateFormControls() and didAssociateFormControlsTimerFired()

        [css-grid] Add support for percentage gaps
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170764

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        Part of the code to support percentage gaps was already imported
        from Blink in r213149 (bug #168657). However parsing was not enabled yet,
        so some pieces were missing.

        This patch accepts percentages in the parsing of grid-column-gap and
        grid-row-gap properties, and the grid-gap shorthand.
        On top of that it gets rid of GridTrackSizingAlgorithm::sizingOperation()
        method as it's not needed. And instead it passes the specific operation
        to each call to RenderGrid::guttersSize(), otherwise we would be getting
        wrong results.

            Optional:
                'values' -> Non-empty array of strings allowed after the equal (=) sign in 
                   the extended attribute. Like before, an empty string indicates it is 
                   ok to not have a value and a star (*) indicates any string is allowed.
                   Not providing a values property at all indicates that no value is
                   allowed.

                'standard' -> An object with information about the standard this attribute
                   comes from. Should only be added to attributes that come from standards.

                'unsupported' -> A boolean with value true, indicating this property is not
                   yet supported. Should only be used for standard attributes.

        URLs. If no item providers have available data, we will immediately invoke the action with an empty URL array.

        For each item provider with data, we save the local URL returned in the load completion block to a randomly
        generated path in the container's temporary directory. When all files are finished loading, we then invoke the

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Minor tweaks and refactoring to support displaying a WebCore::Icon from a list of filepaths on iOS. Please see
        below annotations for more details. No new tests yet, as behavior on Mac should not have changed, and behavior
        on iOS will not change until later patches land. Tests will be added in a later patch.

        Most of the changes here remove platform special-casing in FileInputType for iOS and Mac, refactoring the code
        such that it works for both platforms while preserving behavior.

        Un-guard m_fileIconLoader on iOS, and un-guard m_displayString for Mac. Consolidate logic in both version of
        filesChosen and remove the iOS-specific version. Behavior when passing in an empty display string and null Icon
        will be the same as that of the existing filesChosen method on Mac. Also, introduce a version of setFiles that
        takes an additional RequestIcon enum that indicates whether or not to additionally use the new filepaths to
        request an Icon update. filesChosen invokes this with RequestIcon::No if a non-null Icon was specified, as is
        the case when uploading a file via the image picker on iOS.

        WebAssembly: We should be able to postMessage a JSWebAssemblyModule
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170573

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        This patch's main purpose is to implement postMessage of JSWebAssemblyModule.
        The spec text describing the behavior is: https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/JS.md#structured-clone-of-a-webassemblymodule
        We only allow for JSWebAssemblyModule to be serialized in the postMessage
        context. More work needs to be done to make it valid to store a module in
        IndexDB.
        
        All that is needed to serialize a JSWebAssemblyModule is grab a Ref
        to its underlying Wasm::Module. So, when doing a postMessage, all we
        do is grab this Ref, and then re-create the JSWebAssemblyModule from
        the Wasm::Module in the new VM/global object. Because the code for
        Wasm::Module is VM-independent, this is all that's needed. This turned
        out nicely, because it requires little knowledge from WebCore about
        what it means to clone a JSWebAssemblyModule.
        
        
        The second significant part of this patch is teaching WorkerRunLoop about
        the various timers inside JSC. Before, the WorkerRunLoop wouldn't always
        wake up to address JSC timers. I noticed this bug when I was writing
        tests to make sure that Wasm was running concurrently in different
        workers. The bug is that the WorkerRunLoop's message queue has no insight
        into a timer being scheduled. This effected the PromiseDeferredTimer that
        Wasm uses, as well as the various GC timers that Heap uses. Now, WorkerRunLoop
        will set itself up to be notified when timers are set. When a timer is
        set, the WorkerRunLoop will perform an iteration to to reset its top
        level MessageQueue timeout to be no longer than the next timer fire date.

        [WebIDL] Add support for extended attributes on types in WebIDL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170759

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        - Update parsing for WebIDL grammar changes.
        - Adds an extended attributes hash to IDLType that is filled according
          to the WebIDL annotated type rules.
        - Updates code generation to take advantage of IDLType's extended attribute
          simplifying some existing code.
        - Update IDLs in the project to adhere to the new grammar.

        Well-known variations should clamp to the values listed in the @font-face block
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169260

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Most of this patch is plumbing the variation ranges from the CSSFontFace object
        to preparePlatformFont() where variation values get applied.

        Beyond that, there is one other piece of this patch - a nonspecified value in an
        @font-face block shouldn't perform any clamping, but a specified value should be
        clamped. This means that we need to retain whether or not a value is specified.
        This patch does this by migrating CSSFontFace from using FontSelectionCapabilities
        to using FontSelectionSpecifiedCapabilities, which has its internals behind
        std::optionals which represent whether or not the value was specified. For the
        purposes of font selection, these unspecified values are replaced with default
        values.

        Implement stroke-color CSS property.

        Reviewed by Jon Lee.

        Support setting text stroke color using the CSS property stroke-color, see https://drafts.fxtf.org/paint/.
        Text stroke color can currently be set with the -webkit-text-stroke-color property. To make sure this still
        works, I added a check to determine if the stroke-color property has been explicitly set. If it has not been
        set, we fall back to the value of the -webkit-text-stroke-color property.

        and running multiple iterations of the test resulted in preloaded being taken out of MemoryCache
        and not having the unknown encoding flag. In those cases, the result was a double download and

        REGRESSION(r215211): [GTK] Lots of image related tests are timing out, causing the test bot to exit early
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170727

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Since r215211 ImageDecoder::isSizeAvailable() calls encodedDataStatus() in the different decoder implementations,
        and those implementations force a partial decoding of the image if the size is not available yet. But
        ImageDecoder::isSizeAvailable() was already being used inside the decoders assuming that it wasn't going to
        force this partial decoding. Due to this, there are some situations where the partial decoding is not
        desired but it's happening anyway. For example, the check in setSize(), which causes the partial decoding
        to happen again and again because no value is actually set to the animation size (which causes the timouts
        in the test bot).

        To avoid this, replace all the calls to ImageDecoder::isSizeAvailable() inside the decoders with calls to
        ImageDecoder::encodedDataStatus(), which doesn't force the partial decoding.

        CachedImage should stop decoding images when unknown type is detected
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170530

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        If the status of the encoded data is "unknown type", WebKit should stop
        decoding the rest of the data. Ideally WebKit should also cancel loading
        the rest of the encoded data.
        
        To do that we need to add a function to the ImageDecoder to return the
        encodedDataStatus(). We also need to change the return type of Image::setData()
        and Image::dataChanged() form bool to EncodedDataStatus.

        Data interaction on an image enclosed by an anchor should vend the anchor's URL

        When writing an image embedded inside an anchor to the pasteboard, actually use the enclosing anchor's href if
        it exists. Previously, we were simply dropping this argument on the floor.

        Covered by 2 new DataInteractionTests: ImageInLinkToInput and ImageInLinkWithoutHREFToInput.

        Reduce the tiling coverage to a minimum when the page is non-visible.
        On macOS, this means that fully occluded web views can maintain a smaller set of tiles
        in non-volatile surfaces, reducing net footprint.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168425

        Reviewed by Said Abou-Hallawa.

        There is a problem with animations that are blending their frames into the previous frame. Due to a change
        in how pixel components are premultiplied (the result is now rounded up), the parameters to the blending
        operation may vary in one unit, causing the result of the blending to be different from the expected result.
        In order to fix this, a new parameter is added to indicate whether we want to use rounding up when
        premultiplying or not, and ImageBackingStore uses that parameter to disable rounding up.

        Adjusted the expectation for fast/images/animated-png.html, as it must pass now.

        In r214635, we needed to calculate the image scaleFactor for all platforms.
        It was needed do the calculation: sizeForDrawing = sizeOfImage * imageScaleFactor.
        This made ImageSource::subsamplingLevelForScale() now returns a SubsamplingLevel
        not equal to SubsamplingLevel::Default if the image scaleFactor is greater
        than {1, 1} for all platforms. The subsamplingLevel should only be used for CG.
        
        This is also a chance to make nativeImageDrawingScale() a across platform

        [Variation Fonts] Width values of GX fonts are not mapped correctly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170367

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        For some reason, when I performed my calculations for how to map the 'wdth' axis of GX-style
        variation fonts, I thought that font-stretch: 100% should map to a variation value of 0.0.
        Instead, this should map to 1.0.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Once a synchronous decoded frame is found, there is no need to decode it
        again. This decoded frame is suitable for any sizeForDrawing. This will
        prevent double decoding if one image client wants synchronous decoded

        REGRESSION(r211382): Complex text with justification erroneously overflows containers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170399
        <rdar://problem/31442008>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When we perform justification, we adjust glyphs' advances to add extra space between words.
        ComplexTextController maintains an invariant where m_totalWidth is equal to the sum of these
        advances. However, in RTL text, inserting extra justification space to the left of a glyph
        would break that invariant, and would increase the advances of two glyphs instead of just
        one. Then, when we go to draw the text, the sum of the advances is wider than m_totalWidth,
        which means the glyphs would be drawn outside of their container.

        This regressed in r211382 simply because of an oversight and because there were no tests for
        this codepath.

        [GCrypt] Implement raw and JWK imports and exports for EC keys
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170546

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Implement import and export operations for EC keys, covering the raw
        and JWK import/export types.

        CryptoKeyEC::platformImportRaw() builds a public-key s-expression,
        providing the curve name and the key data, and yields the gcry_sexp_t
        object to the new CryptoKeyEC.

        CryptoKeyEC::platformImportJWKPublic() first constructs a Vector<uint8_t>
        object that contains the EC point in the uncompressed format. It then
        puts that data into a newly-constructed public-key s-expression that is
        then used to construct the new CryptoKeyEC object.

        CryptoKeyEC::platformImportJWKPrivate() constructs the EC point data just
        the same, but it also lays out the private key field element data into
        the private-key s-expression that's then handed off to the CryptoKeyEC
        object.

        CryptoKeyEC::platformExportRaw() constructs a new EC operations context
        and then uses it to retrieve the q parameter as an MPI. A Vector<uint8_t>
        is retrieved from the MPI data through the extractMPIData() helper
        function.

        CryptoKeyEC::platformAddFieldElements() similarly uses the EC operations
        context to retrieve the q parameter data, which it then splits into the
        x and y field elements and Base64 URL-encodes them into a form that can
        be placed in a JsonWebKey. If the key is private, the d parameter is
        retrieved in the same fashion and again Base64 URL-encoded and stored
        in the JsonWebKey object.

        No new tests -- current ones cover this sufficiently, but are not yet
        enabled due to other missing platform-specific SUBTLE_CRYPTO

        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyRSA::generatePair()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170350

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Start implementing the libgcrypt-based platform bits of CryptoKeyRSA.

        Implement generatePair() by constructing a genkey s-expression
        that requests a generation of an RSA key that should use a modulus
        of the specified bit-length and the specified exponent. The exponent
        is extracted from an uint8_t array through a helper function. The
        modulus length value is checked to be at least 16, since libgcrypt
        does not support generating primes of less than that length in bits.

        The returned s-expression upon request will contain the data for
        both the public and the private key. gcry_sexp_t handles representing
        those s-expressions are then passed to CryptoKeyRSA::create() before
        invoking the success callback with a new CryptoKeyPair object in a
        separate ScriptExecutionContext task.

        The CryptoKeyRSA constructor simply has the notImplemented() call
        removed. The destructor now invokes the HandleDeleter<gcry_sexp_t>
        object instance to destroy the object represented by the
        m_platformKey handle.

        The methods in CryptoKeyRSA.cpp are also reordered to follow the
        declaration order used in the header.

        No new tests -- current ones cover this sufficiently, but are not yet

        Scroll offset jumps after a programmatic scroll in an overflow container with scroll snapping

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Test: css3/scroll-snap/scroll-snap-programmatic-overflow-scroll.html

        Logic for maintaining the scroll snap state in ScrollController was previously removed from iOS when refactoring
        ScrollController. This was done because scroll snapping on iOS is driven not by the ScrollController (as it is
        on Mac) but rather by sending scroll snap offsets to the UI process and hooking into UIScrollView delegates to
        handle retargeted scrolling.

        However, on iOS, this ScrollController state is still important for the purposes of keeping the last active
        snap point index in sync with the UI process when the scroll offset changes outside of a user gesture (i.e.
        programmatic scrolling). Since the UI process does not get a chance to update the active snap offset during a
        programmatic scroll, our last active snap offset state was only being updated to the last snap position that the
        user manually scrolled to, making programmatic scrolling jump to this offset.

        To fix this, we need to update scroll snap state on iOS within ScrollController. Also adds a new Layout test
        that exercises programmatic scrolling in an overflow scrolling container on all platforms.

        <rdar://problem/31442875>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        When a range's slider is being moved, we set SliderThumbElement's m_inDragMode flag
        to true and mark the range elements as the CapturingMouseEventsElement. When we get
        the mouseUp event, we are supposed to exit drag mode. However, when the range element
        gets disabled while dragging, we do not get the mouseUp event and we need to make
        sure we exit dragging mode anyway. r112547 tried to fix this by calling stopDragging()
        in SliderThumbElement::defaultEventHandler() when the input element is disabled.
        While this often works, this is fragile and we sometimes fail to exit dragging mode
        when we should.

        This patch addressed the issue by calling stopDragging() in
        SliderThumbElement::disabledAttributeChanged() instead. This is much safer as we
        guarantee will exit dragging mode whenever the range element gets disabled, even
        if SliderThumbElement::defaultEventHandler() does not get called after that.

        REGRESSION (r202472): Data Detection overwrites existing links in detected ranges
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170365
        <rdar://problem/29205721>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r202472 changed the node traversal in searchForLinkRemovingExistingDDLinks() to only
        consider nodes that are descendants of startNode, but we need to traverse all nodes between
        startNode and endNode to find existing non-DD links.

        As a result, we'd add a Data Detector link to the following snippet and make the original
        links un-clickable:

            <a href='#'>tomorrow</a> <a href='#'>night</a>

        Fix this by not specifying a stayWithin node when calling NodeTraversal::next(). The loop
        will terminate when we reach endNode.

        Data interaction should register type identifiers in order of priority
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170428
        <rdar://problem/30633296>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, due to the shared logic for writing to a UIPasteboard (in the case of copy/paste) and the shared
        UIItemProvider-based pasteboard wrapper (in the case of data interaction), we don't enforce any particular
        ordering in which type identifiers are registered in the generated item provider. This is because
        -[UIPasteboard setItems:] only takes an unordered mapping of type identifiers to objects.

        To fix this, we introduce a separate way to set pasteboard data that first writes a list of object
        representations in order of priority (which is dependent on the content being interacted with) and then register
        individual type-data mappings at the end.

        Augmented existing API tests in DataInteractionTests to check for the existence and priority of type identifiers
        in the UIItemProviders created upon starting data interaction. Also adds a new unit test:
        DataInteractionTests.TextAreaToInput.

        [GCrypt] Implement CryptoKeyEC::keySizeInBits(), ::platformGeneratePair()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170345

        Reviewed by Michael Catanzaro.

        Start implementing the libgcrypt-based platform bits of CryptoKeyEC.

        Implement keySizeInBits() by returning the appropriate size for this
        object's curve type. An assertion is added to ensure that this size
        matches the one that's returned by gcry_pk_get_nbits() for this
        object's EC key as represented by the m_platformKey gcry_sexp_t object.

        Implement platformGeneratePair() by constructing a genkey s-expression
        that requests a generation of an EC key for the specified curve type.
        The s-expression is then passed to gcry_pk_genkey(), and the public
        and private key data is then retrieved from the returned s-expression
        upon success and used to create the public and private CryptoKeyEC
        objects.

        The PlatformECKey type alias is changed to match gcry_sexp_t. The
        CryptoKeyEC destructor releases the gcry_sexp_t object through
        a PAL::GCrypt::HandleDeleter<gcry_sexp_t> instance.

        The method definitions in the CryptoKeyECGCrypt.cpp file are also
        sorted to match the declaration order in the header.

        No new tests -- current ones cover this sufficiently, but are not yet
        enabled due to other missing platform-specific SUBTLE_CRYPTO
        implementations.

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

        While searching for mid-word break, we measure the text by codepoints in a loop until the accumulated width > available width.
        When we see that the accumulated width for the individual codepoints overflows, we join the codepoints and re-measure them.
        These 2 widths could be considerably different for number of reasons (ligatures is a prime example). When we figure that
        the run still fits, we go back to the main loop (since we are not supposed to wrap the line here) and take the next codepoint.
        However this time we start the measurement from the last whitespace, so we end up remeasuring a potentially long chuck of text
        until we hit the wrapping point. This is way too expensive.
        This patch changes the logic so that we just go back to measuring individual codepoints until we hit the constrain again.  

        Covered by existing tests.

        There are two instances where nodes are registered as touch event handlers without
        having normal touch event listeners: slider thumb elements, and elements with overflow scrolling,
        on iOS.

        For such nodes, hasEventTargetData() will be false, but we want to ensure
        that they are removed from the Document's touchEventHandler set, so move the
        call to document.removeTouchEventHandler() outside of the conditional block.

        REGRESSION (r213764): Background image from sprite sheet incorrectly scaled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169547

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The bug happens when drawing only a rectangle of an image not the whole
        image. In BitmapImage::draw(), sizeForDrawing was calculated as the destRect
        scaled by the transformation which is applied to the GraphicsContext. Two
        problems with this approach. The first one is destRect can be only part of
        the image. The second problem is, the ratio destRect / srcRect is another
        scaling that needs to be considered.

        To fix this issue, first the base size has to be size of the image and not
        destRect.size(). Secondly, we need to scale this base size with the context
        transformation multiplied by the ratio destRect / srcRect. This scaling is
        exactly the same scaling which is calculated in subsamplingScale(). Finally
        we use this scaled size as the sizeForDrawing to send to the ImageDecoder.

        [css-align] Adapt content-alignment properties to the new baseline syntax
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170262

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The baseline-position syntax has changed recently, so we need to update
        the CSS properties using the old syntax. This patch address only the
        content-alignment (align-content and justify-content).

        I used this patch to adapt the implementation of the parsing logic for
        these properties to the new Blink's CSS Parsing Design.

        The new baseline syntax is "[first | last ]? baseline" which implies
        modifying the parsing and computed value logic.

        There are several layout tests affected by this change, so I'll update
        them accordingly.

        No new tests, just added/modified some cases to the tests we
        already have using the new baseline values.

        [css-grid] Clamp the number of autorepeat tracks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170120

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        As suggested by the specs we do clamp the maximum number of tracks per grid in order to
        minimize potential OOM situations. However we were not considering the case of the recently
        added auto repeat syntax. Abnormally huge values for the width/height on the grid container
        could lead to a number of auto repeat tracks higher than the maximum.

        A new API was added to Internals in order to test limits without having to create huge
        grids. This new API allows clients to set an arbitrary limit to the number of tracks. The
        addition of this new API forced us to add GridPosition.cpp to the project to define the
        global variable we use for testing. We took the chance to move part of the implementation
        from the header file to the source file.

        Last but not least, several new ASSERTs were added to Grid.cpp implementation to ensure that
        we do not surpass the grid track limits.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        TrueType GX-style variation fonts use one particular scale for values on their
        weight/width/slope axes - usually the values lie between -1 and 1 on that scale.
        However, OpenType 1.8-style fonts use the CSS scale for values on these axes.
        For the purposes of font selection, these values need to lie on the same scale.
        However, when font selection is completed and the variation values are actually
        being applied to the fonts, values which lie on the font's actual scale need to
        be applied. This patch adds normalize*() and denormalize*() functions to perform
        both of these operations. 

        The conversion itself between the two scales isn't an exact mapping. Mapping
        slope is just a linear relationship with 0deg <=> 0 and 20deg <=> 1 (as per the
        CSS Fonts spec). Mapping widths is similar, it uses a 2-component piecewise
        linear relationship which includes the values given in the Microsoft OpenType
        spec for the OS/2 table's usWidthClass field. Weights are more difficult, so I
        plotted the CSS weights and the GX-style weights for every style of San
        Francisco, saw that the relationship appears to be linear, and ran a linear
        regression to compute the line equation.

        As for the actual discrimination of determining whether a font is a GX-style
        font or not, we can use the presence of the 'STAT' table. This table didn't
        exist when GX fonts were being created, and OpenType 1.8 variable fonts are
        required to have this table.

        Facebook uses the string ".SFNSText" in their @font-face blocks. This font is
        a variation font, but uses the GX-style values. Facebook asks us to create
        this font with a weight of 700, and because the values in the font are around
        1.0, we were erroneously thinking that the font wasn't bold, so we were then
        applying synthetic bold. This was causing text on facebook to look fuzzy and
        ugly.

        between 0 and 1, you lose a lot of fidelity. Instead, our intermediate

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The baseline-position syntax has changed recently, so we need to update
        the CSS properties using the old syntax. This patch address only the
        self-alignment (align-self and justify-self) and default-alignment
        (align-items and justify-items).

        The content-distribution properties (align-content and justify-content)
        will be updated in a follow up patch.

        The new baseline syntax is "[first | last ]? baseline" which implies
        modifying the parsing and computed value logic.

        There are several layout tests affected by this change, so I'll update

        Animated SVG images are not paused in pages loaded in the background
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170043
        <rdar://problem/31234412>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Animated SVG images are not paused in pages loaded in the background. We rely
        on FrameView::isOffscreen() to stop images animations in background tab (See
        logic in RenderElement's shouldRepaintForImageAnimation()). This works fine
        if a tab is visble and then becomes hidden (i.e. by switching to another
        tab). However, in the case where the tab gets loaded while in the background
        (e.g. opening link in new background tab, or session restore), then the
        animations would not be paused, due to FrameView::isOffscreen() erroneously
        returning false in this case.

        Normally, the following chain of events happens:
        - Page is visible, we construct a main frame and its FrameView for loading
          the page. When a FrameView is constructed, we call FrameView::show() to
          make it visible. Then, if the page becomes non-visible, we call
          Page::setIsVisibleInternal(false) which calls FrameView::hide(). After
          that, FrameView::isOffscreen() correctly returns true because we properly
          called FrameView::hide().

        However, when doing a load while the Page is hidden, the following was
        happening:
        - Page is not visible, we call Page::setIsVisibleInternal(false) which tries
          to call FrameView::hide() for the main frame but it does not have a FrameView
          yet (because the load has not started). We start the load and end up creating
          a FrameView. The FrameView constructor was calling FrameView::show()
          unconditionally, thus making the FrameView think is visible, even though its
          page isn't. At this point, FrameView::isOffscreen() was returning false
          and animations would keep running, even though the page is not visible.

        To address the issue, we now call FrameView::show() in FrameView::create() only
        if the Page is actually visible, instead of calling it unconditionally. If the
        page ever becomes visible, Page::setIsVisibleInternal(true) will be called and
        it will take care of calling FrameView::show() then.

        [Modern Media Controls] Controls bar may disappear while captions menu is visible (redux)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170239
        <rdar://problem/31320685>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We did some work in webkit.org/b/168751 to prevent the controls bar from disappearing while the
        captions menu is visible. But there were two cases where the behavior was not as intended:

            1. the controls bar would hide upon exiting the video.
            2. clicking on the controls bar while the caption panel is up would hide the controls bar
               as well as the captions panel.

        Instead of determining that the "userInteractionEnabled" property being set to "false" is indicative
        of secondary UI, such as the tracks panel, being attached to the controls bar, we now have an
        explicit property to specify this. Now, when "hasSecondaryUIAttached" is "true", we prevent the
        controls bar from fading when exiting the media.

        Additionally, when dismissing the tracks panel, we check whether a mouse event lead to this and check
        if the mouse was positioned over the controls bar. If that is the case, we no longer hide the controls
        bar and only dismiss the tracks panel.

        [Modern Media Controls] Improve media documents across macOS, iPhone and iPad

        <rdar://problem/17048858>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        There were a variety of issues with media documents, some longstanding, and some specifically
        about modern media controls.

        One issue was that fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons would show for audio media documents,
        due to using a <video> element to load the audio file. We now have additional logic in MediaController
        to identify if the loaded media is really an audio file, and using this information to hide the
        fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons.

        Another issue was that we would inject style in MediaDocument.cpp that was specific to modern media
        controls when we could have the modern-media-controls module injected CSS handle this styling. We now
        use the injected style in the shadow root to size media documents based on the device characteristics
        and ensuring that page styles are overridden.

        We also simplify how MediaDocument.cpp sets the source of the media element to simply use the "src"
        attribute and not a <source> element.

        Finally, we introduce a MediaDocumentController class that is instantiated when we're dealing with
        a media document to hide the controls while we determine the type of media we're loading (audio vs.
        video) in order to apply the appropriate styling without flashes.

        As a result of the new styles applied by the modern-media-controls module, media documents have a
        similar behavior on macOS and iPad, where we only enforce a min-width for video allowing them
        to play at their natural size otherwise, and enforcing a fixed width for audio. On iPhone however,
        we want to always play the media at full width, with some padding in the case of audio.

        REGRESSION(213764): Large images should not be decoded asynchronously when they are drawn on a canvas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169771

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Sometimes we have to draw the image immediately like when a canvas calls  
        drawImage. In this case we have to decode the image synchronously to guarantee
        the drawing. Other times we need to decode with the native size of the image.
        The animated images have to be decoded with native size always. Otherwise
        the frame cache will be messed up if the same image is animated with different
        sizes. Currently we always decode asynchronously with sizeForDrawing. We need
        to decouple the decoding mode from the sizeForDrawing.

        This patch introduce the DecodingOptions class which can store and compare the
        following four cases:
            -- Synchronous: The frame has be decoded with native size only.
            -- Asynchronous + anySize: This is passed from the Image::draw() callers.
            -- Asynchronous + fullSize: The image has to be decoded with its full size.
            -- Asynchronous + sizeForDrawing: The image can be decoded with sizeForDrawing unless
            it was decoded with either a full size or sizeForDrawing which is larger than the
            requested sizeForDrawing.
            
        A new argument of type DecodingMode will be added to Image::draw() function.
        Only when the drawing comes from the render tree, it will be Asynchronous.
        Otherwise it will be Synchronous.

        Allow the page to render before <link> stylesheet tags in body
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149157
        <rdar://problem/24658830>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Currently we block style and renderer building completely if document has any loading
        stylesheets. In case a script queries something layout dependent we construct the render
        tree with whatever style we have but block painting in it.

        This patch changes behavior so that a loading stylesheet in body only blocks rendering for elements
        that are after it. The expectation is that such stylesheets rarely affect elements before them
        and the elements can be rendered without causing ugly visible styling changes.

        The patch replaces the old flash-of-unstyled-content (FOUC) preventation mechanism with a more
        fine-grained one. Paint blocking is now done on per-renderer basis with based on isNonFinal flag in
        RenderStyle.

        For stylesheets in head the behavior should be largely unchanged.

        [Modern Media Controls] Improve media documents across macOS, iPhone and iPad
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169145
        <rdar://problem/17048858>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        There were a variety of issues with media documents, some longstanding, and some specifically
        about modern media controls.

        One issue was that fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons would show for audio media documents,
        due to using a <video> element to load the audio file. We now have additional logic in MediaController
        to identify if the loaded media is really an audio file, and using this information to hide the
        fullscreen and picture-in-picture buttons.

        Another issue was that we would inject style in MediaDocument.cpp that was specific to modern media
        controls when we could have the modern-media-controls module injected CSS handle this styling. We now
        use the injected style in the shadow root to size media documents based on the device characteristics
        and ensuring that page styles are overridden.

        We also simplify how MediaDocument.cpp sets the source of the media element to simply use the "src"
        attribute and not a <source> element.

        Finally, we introduce a MediaDocumentController class that is instantiated when we're dealing with
        a media document to hide the controls while we determine the type of media we're loading (audio vs.
        video) in order to apply the appropriate styling without flashes.

        As a result of the new styles applied by the modern-media-controls module, media documents have a
        similar behavior on macOS and iPad, where we only enforce a min-width for video allowing them
        to play at their natural size otherwise, and enforcing a fixed width for audio. On iPhone however,
        we want to always play the media at full width, with some padding in the case of audio.

        The video header on zillow.com would pause when switching to another tab after r214195. On
        switching back to the zillow.com tab, we would resume the video but fail to take the poster
        away, making it look like the video is still paused.

        We normally take the poster away when HTMLMediaElement::mediaPlayerFirstVideoFrameAvailable()
        is called. However, mediaPlayerFirstVideoFrameAvailable() was only ever called once because of
        the m_haveReportedFirstVideoFrame flag in MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundation::updateStates().
        We now reset m_haveReportedFirstVideoFrame to false in updateStates() if hasAvailableVideoFrame()
        return false, so that we call mediaPlayerFirstVideoFrameAvailable() again when the return
        value of asAvailableVideoFrame() becomes true again (e.g. after the media session interruption
        has ended).

        Reduce the scope of code that should never dispatch DOM events so as to allow updating contents size
        after restoring a page from the page cache.

        In r214014 we instantiate a NoEventDispatchAssertion in FrameLoader::commitProvisionalLoad()
        around the call to CachedPage::restore() to assert when a DOM event is dispatched during
        page restoration as such events can cause re-entrancy into the page cache. As it turns out
        it is sufficient to ensure that no DOM events are dispatched after restoring all cached frames
        as opposed to after CachedPage::restore() returns.

        Also rename Document::enqueue{Pageshow, Popstate}Event() to dispatch{Pageshow, Popstate}Event(),
        respectively, since they synchronously dispatch events :(. We hope in the future to make them
        asynchronously dispatch events.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We make the addition of certain Placard children conditional on the placard's metrics. Whenever the
        media controls metrics changes, the placard, if any, is set to have the same metrics and layout() is
        called where we ensure that there is enough space, per designs, to have the icon, description and even
        the title visible. We also make some CSS improvements to guarantee that the description is laid out on
        two lines at most and that both text labels are trimmed elegantly with an ellipsis shold the width be
        insufficient to display the whole text.

        Since we would have needed to have more width/height setter overrides to trigger layout, we now make
        LayoutNode trigger layout() directly and remove the need for subclasses to do this on a per-class basis.
        We also make layout() a method that can be called safely anytime as it's now no longer part of the DOM
        commit step, a new commit() method is used instead of that.

        With variation fonts, font-style's value can't be captured in a CSSPrimitiveValue (nor any other subclass

        style and it's associated @font-face descriptor accept.

        The grammar of the font-style property is "normal | italic | oblique [ <<angle>> ]?"
        The grammar of the font-style descriptor is "normal | italic | oblique [ <<angle>> | <<angle>> <<angle>> ]?"

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When testing content extensions, we have always called an API function that internally
        has called AtomicString::init somewhere before we start compiling the content extension.
        On iOS, though, we call [_WKUserContentExtensionStore compileContentExtensionForIdentifier:...]
        without having already called anything that calls AtomicString::init.  The new CSS parser is now
        failing to parse some selectors because CSSSelectorParser::defaultNamespace is returning starAtom,
        which is a null atomic string before AtomicString::init is called.

        Covered by a new API test.

        Adding support for replaceTrack for audio and video sources.
        Replacing tracks will always succeed for audio sources.
        For video tracks, it will only succeed if the video resolution is not greater.
        LibWebRTCPeerConnectionBackend will delegate the track replacing by replacing the source of the outgoing sources with the source wrapped in the replacing track.

        Video test is not fully passing as size constraints for mock video sources are not providing the right video stream resolution.

        since r214338, the content type is known and inferred from the extension in this case, what ends up calling
        nextMediaEngine() in MediaPlayer::loadWithNextMediaEngine. That returns the first registered media engine, that
        is Owr that doesn't know how to load that and fails.

        font shorthand should accept variation values
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168998

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The CSS Fonts 4 spec has stabilized as to which variation values are allowed in
        the font shorthand property. Weights are allowed because a 0 weight is considered
        as a parse error, so there is no conflict with a unitless font-size of 0.
        font-style accepts angles, so there is no conflict there. However, font-stretch
        accepts percentages, which are also accepted by font-size, which means the newly
        extended grammar for font-stretch can't be accepted in the shorthand.
