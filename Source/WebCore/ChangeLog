        SVGRenderSupport::mapLocalToContainer() was trying to apply transforms
        in the incorrect order. Specifically, it would attempt to apply its
        localToParentTransform before its localToBorderBoxTransform. This

        match up to those computed by RenderGeometryMap.

        Reviewed by Andrei Bucur.

        regionAtBlockOffset method is meant to be used after the flow thread validated
        its region chain, otherwise we cannot rely on regionAtBlockOffset to determine correctly
        the target region based on the offset in flow thread coordinates.

        When the video element is collected in a named flow and displayed in a region, we ensure
        that the region's decorations are taken into account to properly position the video.
        However, we have to do that only if the named flow regions are validated.

        I changed the method cachedRegionForCompositedLayer to check only the "cached" region
        for a layer and not update the layer to region mappings before returning the region.
        Because method cachedRegionForCompositedLayer does not update the region - layer mappings,
        the code does not call regionAtBlockOffset in situations where the region chain is not validated yet.

        This prevent the call sites from creating AtomicString just for the time of the call.
        This causes a tiny slow down on microbenchmarks that continuously query the same string

        JSC ignores the extra memory cost of HTMLCollection after a major GC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129450

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Report the extra memory cost of HTMLCollection to JSC.

        Unfortunately, the existing mechanism to report the extra memory cost in toJS is insufficient for
        HTMLCollection since collection caches are populated later when HTMLCollection is accessed. Also,
        the extra memory cost reported by Heap::reportExtraMemoryCost will be thrown away after a major GC.

        To work around this limitation, added a visitor.reportExtraMemoryUsage call inside visitChildren
        for interfaces with a newly added ReportExtraMemoryCost IDL extension flag to report the extra cost.

        Since we may need to generate visitChildren when this flag is set, we can't automatically detect
        and generate calls using C++ template as done in r148648.

        Compile attribute value matching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129228

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Add support for compiling value matching when matching attributes in Selector.
        This patch only adds exact matching, the other cases will follow.

        There is a little infrastructure changes since FunctionCall now needs to support
        calls taking 2 arguments. The fun begins when the arguments are not in the right
        registers and need to be moved to the right place. Otherwise the code is straightforward.

        In SelectorCompiler, it is necessary to handle two different cases of matching: case sensitive
        and case insensitive. The choice is done in part at compilation time by asking HTMLDocument
        if the name filter can include case insensitive attribute. The other part is done at runtime
        by querying the element for its type and document.

        Here we need to swap two registers, but we cannot allocate a new register (because the context
        of the function call may have taken all the available registers already).

        On x86, the solution is simple, we can swap the two registers without side effects.

        On other platforms, it is a little more complex. If there is any available register, we can just
        use it as a temporary to make the swap.
        If there are no available registers, we know that all the registers are taken. Since swapArguments()
        was called after pushing all the arguments on the stack, we can safely trash the value of any of those.
        We take the first available register that is not a function argument and use it as a temporary.

        (WebCore::FunctionCall::prepareAndCall):
        This is the fun part, we have two registers where the values must go before the function call. The values
        can be in any combination of the allocated registers. The code here needs to move the two values to
        their target register while avoiding conflicts.

        The matching code is moved in a local scope. This is done to recover the register of qualifiedNameImpl
        before doing any value matching. That register can then be used to store the expected value when matching
        an attribute value.
        It is unfortunate there is so much register pressure in this part.

        Value matching is done outside the loop. The idea is to keep the loop really small since in the vast majority
        of cases, name matching fails.
        If the value matching fails, we jump back into the tight loop.

        This is not ideal in all situation. For example trivial name matching with trivial value matching should
        be done in loop. There is a FIXME to improve those cases later.

        In the case sensitive branch, things are really simple. We have to AtomicStringImpl pointers, if they
        don't match, it is a failure.

        The case sensitive branch start by comparing the pointers in case the values are equal. This is a common
        case and it simplifies the cases for SVG, XHTML, etc.
        If the two values are not equal, we must first find if the context requires case insensitive comparison
        (HTMLElement in HTMLDocument). If the conditions require case insensitive matching, we then fall back
        to a function call.

        When drawing glyphs in an SVG font, the glyphs are converted to paths and then filled. This patch moves
        the glyph -> path conversion into a helper class, GlyphToPathTranslator, and creates an implementation
        for the SVG drawing code. Once this helper class is created, it can be used to trace paths in order
        to make underlines skip over SVG glyphs. This helper class also has an implementation for non-SVG glyphs,
        which allows for the glyph tracing code to be paramaterized over the implementation of the helper class
        rather than if the FontData itself is SVG or not.

        Indenting an indented image element resulted in an extra indentation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129201

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        The bug was caused by endOfParagraph returning a position at the beginning of a block when the position
        passed into the function was at the beginning of the block. Consider the following DOM:
        <blockquote><img></blockquote>

        When endOfParagraph is called on (blockquote, 0), the condition r->isBR() || isBlock(n) in endOfParagraph
        matches immediately on startNode and it returns (blockquote, 0) again.

        This resulted in moveParagraphWithClones invoked by indentIntoBlockquote to erroneously clone the inner
        blockquote. Worked around this bug in ApplyBlockElementCommand::formatSelection by checking this specific
        condition and moving the position to the end of the block. Unfortunately, a lot of existing code depends
        on the current behavior of endOfParagraph so fixing the function itself was not possible.

        There was another bug in indentIntoBlockquote to incorrectly insert a new blockquote into the existing
        blockquote due to the code introduced in r99594 to avoid inserting before the root editable element.
        Since this happens only if outerBlock is the root editable element, which is nodeToSplitTo or an ancestor
        of nodeToSplitTo, explicitly look for this condition.

        layers.
        
        A given layer can be both viewport-constrained and overflow-scrolling (e.g. position:fixed,

        [iOS] Support network state notification using CPNetworkObserver
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129358

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        Add iOS support for navigator.onLine and online/offline events. Since
        it can be expensive to query CPNetworkObserver, wait to do so until
        someone calls NetworkStateObserver::onLine() or
        NetworkStateObserver::addNetworkStateChangeListener(). For clients that
        don't wish to observe network reachability at all, add a global opt-out.
        These clients will only pay the cost of CPNetworkObserver if they load
        a page that explicitly accesses navigator.onLine.

        No new tests. Covered by existing tests.

        Web Replay: route through UserInputBridge when delivering user inputs to WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128150

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add an UserInputBridge instance to each Page. WebKit2 routes a page's user inputs through
        the WebCore page's user input bridge so that the inputs can be selectively captured, filtered,
        and replayed using instrumentation inside the UserInputBridge.

        For now, the routing methods of UserInputBridge have no replay-specific code paths, and just
        put the input delivery code inside WebCore rather than its external clients. Replay-specific
        code paths will be added once https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128782 is fixed. However,
        once complete the code will work as follows:

        - When neither capturing or replaying, behavior is unchanged.

        - When capturing user inputs, each external input is saved into a replay log as it crosses
        the bridge from outside WebCore.

        - When replaying, the bridge closes and user inputs from WebKit2 are not accepted. Instead,
        the saved inputs from the replay log are re-dispatched as if they had crossed the bridge.

        The InspectorCounters code was only used to implement two layout test
        APIs (window.internals.numberOfLive{Nodes,Documents}) yet it had hooks
        in crazy places like Node construction and destruction.

        Rewrote the internals APIs to iterate over all live Documents instead,

        [CSSRegions] Small clean-up of flow threads accelerated compositing code
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129312

        Reviewed by Andrei Bucur.

        Some clean-up for the code used for regions in accelerated compositing functionality:
        1. Rename updateRenderFlowThreadLayersIfNeeded -> updateFlowThreadsLayerToRegionMappingsIfNeeded
        as the function updates the mapping between the flow threads layers and their corresponding regions
        2. Remove RenderLayerCompositor::updateRenderFlowThreadLayersIfNeeded and move the code in place
        at call site since the function body does not require a dedicated function.

        No new functionality, no new tests.

        Subpixel rendering: Ensure consistent border painting width.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129259

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Border edges are painted as (semi)independent rectangles. When snapping an edge rectangle
        to device pixels, its painted dimensions depend on its size and its fractional position.
        Specific combination of position and border width can result in painting edges sized differently.
        Using device snapped border width to calculate inner/outer rectangles helps to maintain
        uniform border width.

        Currently not testable.

        [CSS Shapes] Adjust lineTop position to the next available wrapping location at shape-outsides
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128693

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        When we don't have space next to the floating container, but we have space inside the floating-container next
        to the defined shape-outside, we should wrap around the shape-outside. This patch fixes the behavior both for
        cases when there is no space to fit at the first line, and for the additional lines cases.

        [CSS Grid Layout] handle undefined RemainingSpace in computeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks algorithm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128372

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        From Blink r165692 by <svillar@igalia.com>

        The spec defines a different code path for the computeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks algorithm
        http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/#function-ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks.

        Basically the track breadth is different when the available size is undefined and thus,
        cannot be taken into account during the computations.
        The available size is undefined whenever the height is auto or the grid element has a
        shrink-to-fit behavior.

        It was also renamed the function to match the specs so the function name starts with
        'compute' instead of 'computed'.

        No new tests, but added new cases to some of them.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The painting of the region's layer should not be aborted so early if the region's fragment shouldn't be painted
        because that would prevent all the layer's children from being painted.

        Another problem this patch addresses is that clipping should also be performed when the clip rect is empty,
        which is what happens when painting in a tile in which the flowed element would normally be painted
        if it wasn't clipped by the region.

        Make a generic CDMPrivateMediaPlayer and move its CDMSession into platform/.

        Move the session created by CDMPrivateAVFoundation into platform, and rename
        CDMPrivateAVFoundation to CDMPrivateMediaPlayer. Future media engines who want
        to support a keysystem from within the media engine can create their own
        CDMSession as part of the MediaPlayerPrivate interface.

        jsDocumentPrototypeFunctionGetElementById should not create an AtomicString for the function argument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128893

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The declaration of TreeScope::getElementById() was taking an AtomicString as the parameter.
        Because of this, all the call sites manipulating String were creating and keeping alive an AtomicString
        to make the call.

        This had two negative consequences:
        -The call sites were ref-ing the ID's atomic string for no reason.
        -When there is no ID associated with the input string, an atomic string was created for the sole
         purpose of failing the query. Since IDs are stored as AtomicString, if there is not an existing
         AtomicString for the input, there is no reason to query anything.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The code dispatching mouseenter and mouseleave events was making the assumption that
        only mouse move would cause Document::updateHoverActiveState.

        This is not true in some cases. In the case of this bug, the first touch handler sets
        the hover state. From there, the code handling enter/leave is in an inconsistent state.

        This patch changes the delivery of mouse enter/leave events to be done through the regular
        processing of mouse events. The update is done with the mouseover and mouseout events.

        [CSS Regions] Regions don't paint correctly in new-multicol elements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120711

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch implements basic support for regions inside multi-column elements.
        Currently, the painting and hit-testing logic of CSS Regions is not aware of
        enclosing multi-column elements. The change is integrated at a layer level by
        making use of the pre-computed layer fragments during the painting and hit-testing
        phases for regions.

        There are limitations such that self painting layers found inside the named flow
        thread layer will not be correctly processed because they don't go through the
        layer fragment collection step. This is not trivial to implement because the enclosing
        pagination layer provided by the multi-column element is not visibile from inside
        the named flow thread layer and they reside in different coordinate systems.

        A side effect of this patch is the fix of regions incorrect clipping in certain
        cases (when both a region and its container clip their overflow, the region's
        content is visible outside the container).

        m_ancestorDisabledState should never be unknown
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129084

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        In order to resolve the bug 129035, a text form control elements needs to synchronously change
        its inner text element's editability by setting or unsetting contenteditable content attribute.
        Before this patch, we could not do this because editability of a text form control dependent on
        its disabled-ness which was only computed lazily via updateAncestorDisabledState().

        This patch makes HTMLFieldSetElement and HTMLFormControlElement update this state synchronously.
        To avoid O(k) DOM traversal, where k is the depth of the tree, in insertedInto and removedFrom of
        HTMLFormControlElement on most pages, a new document-level flag, m_disabledFieldsetElementsCount,
        has been added to indicate whether the document contains any disabled fieldset or not.

        Also renamed the misleadingly named disabledAttributeChanged to disabledStateChanged, and added
        new function of the same name (disabledAttributeChanged) to be used by HTMLFieldSetElement
        for keeping the document-level flag up-to-date upon disabled attribute changes.

        This patch is groundwork that adds a very basic image control that can render on top of images.

        * dom/Node.h:
        (WebCore::Node:: isImageControlsRootElement): Returns false, unless you are an ImageControls object.
        * html/HTMLAttributeNames.in:

        Teach HTMLImageElement how to understand an experimental attribute to install controls,
        how to actually build the DOM to attach to the shadow root, how to tear that DOM down,
        and how to make sure that Renderers are created for that DOM:
        * html/HTMLImageElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::HTMLImageElement):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::parseAttribute):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::didAttachRenderers):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::updateImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::createImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::destroyImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::hasImageControls):
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::childShouldCreateRenderer):
        * html/HTMLImageElement.h:
        (WebCore::HTMLImageElement::hasShadowControls): For RenderImage to query when it is constructed. 

        Add a generic, platform independent ImageControls root element that does nothing:
        * html/shadow/ImageControlsRootElement.cpp: Added.
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::maybeCreate):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::ImageControlsRootElement):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::~ImageControlsRootElement):
        * html/shadow/ImageControlsRootElement.h: Added.

        Add a Mac-specific ImageControls root element that renders a 20x20 red box (for now):
        * html/shadow/mac/ImageControlsRootElementMac.cpp: Added.
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElementMac::ImageControlsRootElementMac):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElementMac::~ImageControlsRootElementMac):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElement::maybeCreate):
        (WebCore::ImageControlsRootElementMac::maybeCreate):
        * html/shadow/mac/ImageControlsRootElementMac.h: Added.

        Since much of the RenderMedia::layout() method is now required for RenderImage as well,
        move the logic to RenderImage. The extra work is controlled by a bool flag that will always
        be set for RenderMedias but will only be set for certain RenderImages:
        * rendering/RenderImage.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderImage::RenderImage):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::canHaveChildren):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::layout):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::layoutShadowControls):
        * rendering/RenderImage.h:
        (WebCore::RenderImage::setHasShadowControls):
        (WebCore::RenderImage::shadowControlsNeedCustomLayoutMetrics):

        * rendering/RenderMedia.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderMedia::RenderMedia):
        * rendering/RenderMedia.h:
        (WebCore::RenderMedia::shadowControlsNeedCustomLayoutMetrics):

        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
