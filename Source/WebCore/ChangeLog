        [Pointer Events] Respect pointer capture when dispatching mouse boundary events and updating :hover
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198999

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Up until now, we would not account for pointer capture (see https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#pointer-capture) when dispatching
        mouse boundary events (mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave) and their counterpart pointer events. We would also not account
        for it when updating :hover styles.

        Now, when pointer capture changes for an element, we call setCapturingMouseEventsElement() on the EventHandler such that the element
        that would naturally hit-test is overridden by the pointer capture element when identifying which target to use for the dispatch of
        boundary mouse events. Additionally, when calling EventHandler::prepareMouseEvent(), we also use the pointer capture element to
        eventually pass down to Document::updateHoverActiveState() such that :hover styles are applied to the correct element.

        This also means that we need to re-run EventHandler::prepareMouseEvent() during mouse state changes to ensure that the :hover styles
        are applied correctly should the pointer capture element change during dispatch of boundary mouse events.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::prepareMouseEvent): If there is one, use the pointer capture element instead of the hit-test target.
        (WebCore::Document::updateHoverActiveState): Relax the mustBeInActiveChain condition in case the pointer capture element changed when
        updating the :hover/:active chains.
        * page/EventHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::handleMousePressEvent): Re-process the mouse event if the pointer capture element changed during event dispatch.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::handleMouseMoveEvent): Re-process the mouse event if the pointer capture element changed during event dispatch.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::handleMouseReleaseEvent): As we know the pointer capture element will be reset as part of the mouse being
        released, we reset the pointer capture element and EventHandler's capture element prior to invalidating hover styles and boundary events.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::setCapturingMouseEventsElement): Dispatch boundary events when a new element is set.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::dispatchMouseEvent): New dispatchMouseEvent() variant that re-processes the provided MouseEventWithHitTestResults
        in case the pointer capture element changes during event dispatch, as called by handleMousePressEvent() and handleMouseMoveEvent().
        * page/EventHandler.h:
        * page/PointerCaptureController.cpp:
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::pointerCaptureElement): We now need to query whay the pointer capture element might be from EventHandler,
        so expose a new method to access it.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::releasePointerCapture): Since we may not call processPendingPointerCapture() until the dispatch of the
        next event, we must reset EventHandler's capturing mouse element right now so that the next event processed does not use it as an overriding target.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::hasPointerCapture): We would mistakenly return true if the provided element was null, which could be the
        case of EventHandler's capturing element. Rather than changing call sites to check that the provided value exists, we change the method to
        return false when the provided element is null. Note that this does not affect the API since it's exposed on Element itself.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEventForTouchAtIndex): Call dispatchEvent() instead of calling pointerEventWillBeDispatched() and
        pointerEventWasDispatched().
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEvent): Remove all code specific to pointer capture since now the events will be dispatched on the
        pointer capture element by EventHandler.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::processPendingPointerCapture): Make sure this method is not re-entrant since it dispatches events.
        * page/PointerCaptureController.h:
        * rendering/HitTestRequest.h:
        (WebCore::HitTestRequest::pointerCaptureElementChanged const): Add a new HitTestRequestType bit such that we can indicate to Document::updateHoverActiveState()
        that it must be update the :hover/:active chains when the pointer capture element has just changed.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Tested manually.

        This change just adds a counter to the number of times the user explicitly
        denies storage access and returns early if the counter has reached the limit
        of 2.

        We hoped that iframes that request storage access would count the number
        of times the user has been asked and not repeat the request over and over.
        However, we're seeing pretty aggressive use of the API and users are
        complaining. Therefore, we need a cap on how many times an iframed
        document can ask if it is explicitly denied access by the user.

        This is a first measure. If we see continued aggressive use of the API,
        we'll have to consider more drastic measures.

        [WHLSL] Hook up common texture functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198704
        <rdar://problem/51668841>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch adds the Metal implementation of the Sample(), Load(), and GetDimensions()
        texture functions. The implementation simply performs string concatenation to produce the 
        correct results, and adds many new native functions to the standard library.

        We can't zero-fill texture types or sampler types, so this patch forbids default
        constructors for those types. It also forbids those types to exist within arrays, array
        references, or pointers, becuase an out-of-bounds access may cause us to try to zero-fill
        them.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson and Myles C. Maxfield.

        This patch makes it so that the Checker assigns types to the internal variables
        in a read modify write expression. These were the only variables that didn't have
        types ascribed to them.

        This patch also does a fly by fix where we kept pointers to value types
        in a HashMap in the checker. This is wrong precisely when the HashMap gets
        resized. Instead, we now just store the value itself since we're just
        dealing with a simple Variant that wraps either an empty struct or an
        enum.

        [WHLSL] Support matrices
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198876
        <rdar://problem/51768882>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson and Myles Maxfield.

        This patch adds in support for matrices to WHLSL. Most matrix related code
        is defined by the standard library. This patch just needed to add support
        for the native functions operator[] and operator[]= on matrix types. The only
        native functions that are named operator[] and operator[]= are for matrix
        operations, so we strongly assume when generating code for native operator[] and
        operator[]= that we're dealing with matrix types.
        
        operator[]= ignores the write if the index is out of bounds. operator[]
        returns a zeroed vector if the index is out of bounds.  
        
        This patch also incorporates two bug fixes:
        1. This patch takes Robin's patch in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198313 to ensure
        we don't have pointers to values in a hash map. This was needed in this patch
        otherwise we'd crash parsing the standard library.
        
        2. This patch fixes how we handle "break" in metal codegen. When I first
        implemented break, I strongly assumed we were in a loop. However, break
        can be either from a loop or from switch. This patch teaches the metal code
        generator to track which context we're in and to emit code accordingly.

        Add support for WeakRef
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198710

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        We need to make sure the Web MicrotaskQueue notifies the JSC VM
        that it has finished performing a microtask checkpoint. This lets
        the JSC VM know it is safe to collect referenced WeakRefs. Since
        there was no way to get the VM from the MicrotaskQueue I have
        added a RefPtr to the queue's VM. For the main thread the VM lives
        forever so is fine. For workers the queue and the VM share an
        owner so this shouldn't matter either.

        Add preliminary ANGLE backend to WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197755

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Add new files supplying an ANGLE version of GraphicsContext3D and
        Extensions3D, conditionalized under USE_ANGLE. Update Xcode project to
        build these files. This option compiles and links successfully.

        FIXMEs remain in several common files which will be addressed in
        subsequent patches.

        This work will be tested with the preexisting WebGL conformance
        suite.

        [WHLSL] Do not generate duplicate constructors/copy constructors in synthesizeConstructors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198580

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        Prior to this patch, we were generating duplicate constructors 
        for unnamed types. This is bad for two reasons:
        1. It's inefficient, since we'd generate a constructor for every place in
        the AST where we'd visit this unnamed type.
        2. It made it impossible to resolve function overloads to call
        the default constructor. This made it so that the autoInitializeVariables
        pass would crash if we ever generated more than one of these functions
        for the same type.
        
        To make this work, this patch splits up what used to be the resolveNamesInFunctions
        pass. Previously, this pass would both resolve calls and resolve type names.
        Synthesize constructors would run before this, since resolving calls meant we
        may resolve a call to one of these synthesized constructors. However, synthesize
        constructors now needs to test for the equality unnamed types, so it now requires
        running the type resolution part of resolveNamesInFunctions before it runs.
        
        This patch splits resolveNamesInFunctions into two parts:
        resolveTypeNamesInFunctions and resolveCallsInFunctions.
        
        So we used to run:
        synthesizeConstructors
        resolveNamesInFunctions
        
        And now we run:
        resolveTypeNamesInFunctions 
        synthesizeConstructors
        resolveCallsInFunctions

        Convert macOS to scroll by changing layer boundsOrigin
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198917

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        macOS did frame and overflow scrolling by changing the position of the scrolled
        contents layer. iOS scrolls by changing the boundsOrigin of the scrollContainer layer
        (which it has to, to match how UIScrollView works).

        The iOS approach removes the need for an extra layer whose only role is for
        scroll positioning, so migrate macOS to the same approach. A later patch can remove
        m_scrolledContentsLayer.
        
        We can remove RenderLayerCompositor::m_clipLayer since m_scrollContainerLayer has exactly
        the same role now.

        [WHLSL] Make .length work
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198890

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        This patch makes accessing .length on buffers work. To make this work as
        expected, I've fixed a handful of small bugs:
        
        - The checker was not calling resolveByInstantiation for getters. This patch
          modifies the checker to do that, so we can now resolve a getter to
          "operator.length". I also refactored the checker to have a helper method
          that both does overload resolution and resolveByInstantiation to make it
          difficult to forget to call resolveByInstantiation.
        - The property resolver had a bug where it would return a non-null value
          in anderCallArgument for array references even when there was no ander and
          no thread ander function. This patch makes it now return null if there is
          neither an ander nor a thread ander.
        - The metal codegen incorrectly unpacked the length of buffers. It swapped the
          bottom four bytes and the top four bytes of the size_t value. This patch
          corrects that. This was also a cause of flakiness in various tests since
          we ended up with a length much larger than expected, leading to bounds
          checks always passing in our tests.
        - This patch also fixes our tests to specify the output buffer length
          properly for various programs.

        Implement ScrollableArea::scrollOffset()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198895

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Remove from ScrollableArea the following:
            virtual int scrollSize(ScrollbarOrientation) const = 0;
            virtual int scrollOffset(ScrollbarOrientation) const = 0;
        and instead implement ScrollOffset scrollOffset() const.

        Also make scrollPosition() pure virtual, avoiding the reverse dependency where
        this base class implementation got values from scrollbars.
        
        scrollSize(ScrollbarOrientation) was only used by ScrollAnimatorIOS and we can
        do the same computation via min/max scroll positions.
        
        RenderListBox and PopupMenuWin need implementations of scrollPosition().
        
        Remove some PLATFORM(IOS_FAMILY) #ifdefs from ScrollableArea for code that compiles
        on all platforms.

        Baseline offset is the baseline's distance from the line's logical top -and it is not necessarily the same as the baseline's ascent.
        It's easier to track the baseline and its top separately since certain properties only change one or the other.

        Normally the available width for an in-flow block level box is the width of the containing block's content box.
        However a non-floating positioned float avoider box might be constrained by existing floats.
        The idea here is that we pre-compute(estimate) the vertical position and check the current floating context for
        left and right floats. These floats contrain the available width and this computed value should be used instead of the containing block's
        content box's width whe calculating the used width for width: auto.

        The behavior we're implementing is:
        - OOB writes are ignored.
        - OOB reads return zero.
        - Writes to null are ignored.
        - Reads from null return zero.
        - &*x == x, including &*null == null.
        
        We implement this like so:
        - The value stack in FunctionWriter turns into a stack of pairs: rvalues and lvalues.
          rvalues are represented the same as before. Lvalues are always pointers.
        - Anything that produces an lvalue must push a pointer to the stack. Not
          all things produce lvalues, so that entry in the stack may be empty.
          However, all things that produce lvalues also produce rvalues. So, "*x = 42" works,
          and so does "foo(*x)". Nodes that produce lvalues are responsible for also producing
          an rvalue, which should be the value as if the lvalue was dereferenced at that point
          in program execution. So the "*x" in "thread int* x = null; *x" produces the int zero
          for its rvalue, and null for its lvalue.
        - Dereference just works, as dereference produces both an lvalue and rvalue. Dereference
          node's child must also be an lvalue. So we just forward that value along on
          the stack. For the rvalue, if we try to dereference nullptr, we just fill in
          zero bytes instead. Otherwise, the rvalue is the result of dereferencing the
          non-null pointer.
        - Assignment expressions check if the incoming lvalue is null. If it is, it
          skips the assignment.
        - operator&[] returns nullptr on an OOB access. Then, based on the above
          behavior, we get the desired OOB reads return zero, and OOB writes are
          ignored.
        - MakePointerExpression just takes the last lvalue off the stack (which must
          be a pointer) and returns it as an rvalue.
        - VariableReference will push both the variable value and a pointer to the variable
          onto the stack.

        This patch also fixes a few bugs where we weren't giving certain AST nodes the
        proper address space values.

        This patch also removes code to generate native functions for operators
        "operator[]" and "operator[]=" as we should never be generating these
        ourselves. We should only be generating the "operator&[]" ander.

        IntersectionObserver rootMargin detection fails when `root` is an element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198784

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When computing a target's bounds in root space, we were applying the root's

        rect, we would get an empty intersection even if the target did intersect the
        expanded root rect. Fix this by not applying the root's clip rect when computing
        a target's bounds in root space. Add a new VisibleRectContextOption::ApplyContainerClip

        [WHLSL] Hook up compute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198644

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch hooks up compute shaders in exactly the same way that vertex and fragment shaders
        are hooked up. I've modified the two patchs (compute and rendering) to be almost exactly the
        same code.

        This patch also adds support for the WHLSL compiler to determine what the numthreads()
        attribute in the shader says so that it can be hooked up to Metal's threads-per-threadgroup
        argument in the dispatch call. There is some logic to make sure that there aren't two
        numthreads() attributes on the same compute shader.

        It also adds a little bit of type renaming. For built-in variables, sometimes Metal's type
        doesn't always match WHLSL's (and HLSL's type). For example, in WHLSL and HLSL,        SV_DispatchThreadID variables have to be a float3, but in Metal, they are a uint3.
        Therefore, I've added a little bit of code during each entry point's pack and unpack stages
        to handle this type conversion.

        [Nicosia] Add SceneIntegration
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198791

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Add the SceneIntegration class to the Nicosia namespace, primarily for
        the purpose of being able to conveniently trigger scene updates whenever
        changes are done to the state of layers that are included in that scene.
        Initially this would be used for layer changes done on a
        scrolling-dedicated thread.

        Each Nicosia::PlatformLayer can have a SceneIntegration object reference
        associated. Helper createUpdateScope() method returns a
        SceneIntegration::UpdateScope instance that triggers an update for the
        scene when that instance is destroyed (normally when it goes out of the

        [WHLSL] Hook up compute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198644

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch hooks up compute shaders in exactly the same way that vertex and fragment shaders
        are hooked up. I've modified the two patchs (compute and rendering) to be almost exactly the
        same code.

        This patch also adds support for the WHLSL compiler to determine what the numthreads()
        attribute in the shader says so that it can be hooked up to Metal's threads-per-threadgroup
        argument in the dispatch call. There is some logic to make sure that there aren't two
        numthreads() attributes on the same compute shader.

        It also adds a little bit of type renaming. For built-in variables, sometimes Metal's type
        doesn't always match WHLSL's (and HLSL's type). For example, in WHLSL and HLSL,        SV_DispatchThreadID variables have to be a float3, but in Metal, they are a uint3.
        Therefore, I've added a little bit of code during each entry point's pack and unpack stages
        to handle this type conversion.

        [WHLSL] Implement array references
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198163

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The compiler automatically generates anders for every array reference. Luckily, the infrastructure
        to generate those anders and emit Metal code to represent them already exists in the compiler.
        There are two pieces remaining (which this patch implements):

        1. The JavaScript compiler has a behavior where anders that are called with an array reference
           as an argument don't wrap the argument in a MakePointerExpression. This is because the array
           reference is already a reference type, so it's silly to operate on a pointer to a reference.
           This patch implements this by teaching the type checker about which types should be passed
           to the ander call, and by actually constructing those types in the property resolver.
           The property resolver does this by placing the logic to construct an ander argument in a
           single function which also has logic to save the argument in a temporary if the thread ander
           will be called. The semantics about which functions are called in which situations are not
           changed; instead, we just simply don't wrap array references with MakePointerExpressions.

        2. Creating a bind group from the WebGPU API has to retain information about buffer lengths for
           each buffer so the shader can properly perform bounds checks. This can be broken down into a
           few pieces:
           - Creating a bind group layout has to assign extra id indexes for each buffer which will be
             filled in to represent the buffer's length
           - Creating the bind group itself needs to fill in the buffer length into the Metal argument
             buffer
           - The shader compiler needs to emit code at the beginning of entry point to find the buffer
             lengths and pack them together into the array reference (array references correspond to
             a Metal struct with two fields: a pointer and a length).

        This patch doesn't actually implement bounds checks themselves; it just hooks up the buffer
        lengths so https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198600 can implement it.

        The shader compiler's API is modified to allow for this extra buffer length information to be
        passed in from the WebGPU implementation.

        Unfortunately, I don't think I could split this patch up into two pieces because both are
        required to test the compiler with buffers.

        [WHLSL] Educate the property resolver about IndexExpressions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198399

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This is part one of two patches which will allow buffers to work. This patch
        adds support in the property resolver for index expressions. Index expressions
        get turned into calls to "getter indexers", "setter indexers", or "ander
        indexers". They work almost identically to dot expressions, except there is an
        extra "index" expression which gets turned into an extra argument to those
        functions.

        There's actually a bit of a trick here. Let's say we need to run a getter and
        a setter separately (e.g. "foo[3]++;"). The index expression can't be duplicated
        for both the getter and the setter (e.g. the functions are
        int operator[](Foo, uint) and Foo operator[]=(Foo, uint, int), and we aren't
        allowed to execute the index expression multiple times. Consider if that "3"
        in the example is actually "bar()" with some side effect. So, we have to run
        the index expression once at the correct time, and save its result to a temporary
        variable, and then pass in the temporary variable into the getter and setter.

        So, if the code says "foo[bar()][baz()] = quux();" the following sequence of
        functions get run:

        - bar()
        - operator[](Foo, uint)
        - baz()
        - quux()
        - operator[]=(OtherType, uint, OtherOtherType)
        - operator[]=(Foo, uint, OtherType)

        The next patch will modify the WebGPU JavaScript implementation to send buffer
        lengths to the shader, and for the shader compiler to correctly unpack this
        information and place it inside the array references. That should be everything
        that's needed to get buffers to work. After that, hooking up compute should be
        fairly trivial.

        (WebCore::StyleResolver::adjustRenderStyleForTextAutosizing):

        Rewrite this using early return statements, to make it easier to debug why elements fall out of text autosizing.
        Additionally, this function currently bails if the initial scale is exactly 1, whereas we can really avoid text
        autosizing in the case where the initial scale is at least 1; handle this by making idempotentTextSize return
        immediately with the specified size, in the case where the scale is at least 1.

        Lastly, remove the null check for element by making this method take an Element&, and only call this from
        adjustRenderStyle if the element is nonnull (which matches adjustRenderStyleForSiteSpecificQuirks).

        [CSP] Blob URLs should inherit their CSP policy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198579
        <rdar://problem/51366878>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        As per <https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#security-inherit-csp> (Editor's Draft, 28 February 2019) blob
        URLs should inherit their CSP policy from their parent (if they have one).

        Test: http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/navigate-self-to-blob.html

        is a Blob URL.
        (WebCore::Document::initContentSecurityPolicy): Take a pointer to a ContentSecurityPolicy object that
        represents the previous document's CSP. We only make us of this if the current URL is a Blob URL or a data
        URL. Otherwise, do what we do now and take the policy from the owner frame.
        * dom/Document.h:
        * loader/DocumentWriter.cpp:
        (WebCore::DocumentWriter::begin): Extend the lifetime of the previous document temporarily so that we can
        pass its CSP to FrameLoader::didBeginDocument(). We need to do this extension because this function calls
        FrameLoader::clear(), which can destroy the previous document and its ContentSecurityPolicy object. This
        extension is also no different than if this function was called with a non-null ownerDocument except that
        in that case it is the caller that extends the previous document's lifetime. Although it is tempting to
        make use of ownerDocument to fix this bug by having the caller of begin() pass the previous document as
        the ownerDocument when the new document's url (the one we are begin()ing) is a Blob URL. The ownerDocument
        concept would privilege the Blob URL more than necessary; we only need to inherit the CSP policy from the
        previous document for a Blob URL, not inherit the cookie URL or strict mixed content checking bit, etc. 
        We could make ContentSecurityPolicy ref-counted or even steal the ContentSecurityPolicy object from the
        previous document. The latter is not of the question as a future enhancement, but the former seemed excessive
        as a way to avoid extending the lifetime of the previous document because this would be the *only* call site
        that actaully takes out a second ref of a ContentSecurityPolicy object. In general, shared ownership of
        a ContentSecurityPolicy object does not make sense.

        [WHLSL] Auto initialize local variables
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198426

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        This patch implements zero-filling for local variables in two parts:
        1. We add a new pass, autoInitializeVariables, which makes any variable declaration
        without an initializer call the default constructor for the variable's type.
        Since we auto generate the default constructor, it's a native function whose
        implementation we control.
        
        2. Each native constructor is implemented as a memset(&value, sizeof(value), 0).
        This memset is an inlined loop in each constructor. The reason this turns
        everything into zero is that for every primitive type, the "zero" value is
        represented as all zeroes in memory: float, int, pointers, etc.
        
        Since our ability to test some of this is limited, I opened a follow-up bug to
        test this more:

        REGRESSION (r244182) [WK1]: Page updates should always scheduleCompositingLayerFlush() immediately
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198664

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Because WK1 is a single process, scheduleCompositingLayerFlush() has to 
        be called immediately when layers' update is needed. Otherwise no content
        will be drawn for the current frame. Doing this will get smooth scrolling
        back to WK1.

        RenderingUpdateScheduler now has three different scheduling methods:

        1. scheduleTimedRenderingUpdate(): This is a two-steps scheduling method.
           DisplayRefreshMonitor has to fire before scheduleCompositingLayerFlush()
           is called. This is used by rAF, WebAnimations and intersection and
           resize observers.

        2. scheduleImmediateRenderingUpdate(): This is a one-step scheduling method.
           layerTreeAsText() calls this method because it has to process the rendering
           update within the current frame.

        3. scheduleRenderingUpdate(): RenderLayerCompositor::scheduleLayerFlush()
           calls this function to decide either immediately flush layers or wait
           for the next timed frame. scheduleImmediateRenderingUpdate() will be
           called for WK1. scheduleTimedRenderingUpdate() will be called for WK2.

        [MSE][GStreamer] Avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR when seeking to a buffered range just before the buffered one
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166620

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        This patch is fixing a seek to unbuffered range just before the buffered one.
        For example, supposing a [120, 176) append has filled all the memory and then
        a seek to 115.0 is done, a subsequent [115, 120) append would fail without
        this fix. EvictCodedFrames() would return without actually evicting anything,
        and appendBufferInternal will print "buffer full, failing with
        QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR error" on GStreamer platforms instead of letting the new
        [115, 120) append succeed.

        This patch is based on an original patch by iivlev <iivlev@productengine.com>

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-append-before-last-range-no-quota-exceeded.html

        The loop break condition has also been changed to deal with notFound currentTimeRange.

        [GStreamer] AVC1 decoding capabilities probing support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198569

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        When capabilities for an avc1 codec are requested, the registry scanner looks
        for a compatible decoder for the given H.264 profile and level.

        This new approach can be avoided by using the WEBKIT_GST_MAX_AVC1_RESOLUTION
        environment variable. If supplied, the decoder capabilities won't be probed and
        the codec will be advertised as supported if it complies with the contents of
        the environment variable. The resolutions currently handled are specifically:
        1080P, 720P and 480P. We don't handle framerate checking yet, so the implied
        H.264 levels are assumed to be for 30FPS.

        In order to properly handle this, we should replace the `ASSERT` with an `if` so that Web

        Firing the load event should only happen when dynamic update changes the

        not fire the load event.

        When stopping the animations, applyAnimatedPropertyChange() should be
        called first then stopAnimation() is called second. The target element
        should know that its svgAttributeChanged() is called because of animating

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198497

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        WebInspecter should coalesce nested composites as one recorded composite.
        This can be done by ensuring that we only process CA preCommit and postCommit
        once per nested commits.

        * inspector/InspectorController.cpp:
        (WebCore::InspectorController::willComposite):
        * inspector/InspectorController.h:
        Export willComposite(). We want to call willComposite()/ didComposite()
        from CA preCommit and postCommit handlers in flushLayers().

        * inspector/agents/InspectorTimelineAgent.cpp:
        (WebCore::InspectorTimelineAgent::didComposite):
        Unrelated change: didComposite() should not assert that we're in the middle
        of a composite. Web Inspector may connect in the middle of a composite.

        * page/FrameView.cpp:
        (WebCore::FrameView::flushCompositingStateIncludingSubframes):
        InspectorController::willComposite() will be called form CA preCommit
        handler of flushLayers().

        [WHLSL] Educate the property resolver about IndexExpressions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198399

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This is part one of two patches which will allow buffers to work. This patch
        adds support in the property resolver for index expressions. Index expressions
        get turned into calls to "getter indexers", "setter indexers", or "ander
        indexers". They work almost identically to dot expressions, except there is an
        extra "index" expression which gets turned into an extra argument to those
        functions.

        There's actually a bit of a trick here. Let's say we need to run a getter and
        a setter separately (e.g. "foo[3]++;"). The index expression can't be duplicated
        for both the getter and the setter (e.g. the functions are
        int operator[](Foo, uint) and Foo operator[]=(Foo, uint, int), and we aren't
        allowed to execute the index expression multiple times. Consider if that "3"
        in the example is actually "bar()" with some side effect. So, we have to run
        the index expression once at the correct time, and save its result to a temporary
        variable, and then pass in the temporary variable into the getter and setter.

        So, if the code says "foo[bar()][baz()] = quux();" the following sequence of
        functions get run:

        - bar()
        - operator[](Foo, uint)
        - baz()
        - quux()
        - operator[]=(OtherType, uint, OtherOtherType)
        - operator[]=(Foo, uint, OtherType)

        The next patch will modify the WebGPU JavaScript implementation to send buffer
        lengths to the shader, and for the shader compiler to correctly unpack this
        information and place it inside the array references. That should be everything
        that's needed to get buffers to work. After that, hooking up compute should be
        fairly trivial.

        [WHLSL] Parsing and lexing the standard library is slow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192890
        <rdar://problem/50746335>

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        The main idea is to avoid backtracking by instead peeking at the next token (and occasionally at the one after that).
        This implies a few things:
        - We can replace the stack of tokens by a trivial ring buffer of size 2 (holding the next token and the one after, or WTF::nullopt if we are at the end of the file).
        - We now have "completeFooExpression" functions, to avoid having to reparse the prefix of some expression, if we find half-way through what it is.

        I also fixed the following parser bug:
        - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198305 [WHLSL] Multiple variables with initializers in a declaration statement crashes the compiler
            which was due to a mistake I made in the grammar

        Finally I added two new macros: CONSUME_TYPE and PARSE to eliminate about 500 lines of error propagation boilerplate.

        There are still lots of ways of improving the parser and lexer, such as:
        - finishing the conversion of tokens in the lexer, not bothering with allocating string views
        - make two special tokens Invalid and EOF, to remove the overhead of Optional
        - make peekTypes and consumeTypes use templates to avoid constructing a Vector and calling find on it.
        - Turn the entire lexer into a proper automata, not going through the same characters again and again (this is certainly the largest win by far)
        - Remove the last few pieces of backtracking from the parser.

        The current patch is already enough to make parsing the full standard library (something like 85k lines) approximately 260ms.
        This is still longer than I would like, but nowhere near the bottleneck any longer because of some other parts of the compiler.
