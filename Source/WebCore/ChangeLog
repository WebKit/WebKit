        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104285

        Reviewed by Gustavo Noronha Silva.

        Fix issues in the libsoup networking backend that were causing test
        failures.

        No new tests. This patch unskips authentication tests.

        * platform/network/soup/ResourceHandleSoup.cpp:
        (WebCore::isAuthenticationFailureStatusCode): Added this helper to catch authentication status codes
        and use it everywhere.
        (WebCore::applyAuthenticationToRequest): Use an early return instead of an if-statement
        and instead of always using manually specified credentials, apply those found in the session
        storage as well. Instead of applying the credentials to firstRequest always, accept the request
        as a parameter, so this method can be properly used with redirects.
        (WebCore::restartedCallback): Instead of creating the KURL directly from soup_uri_to_string
        use soupURIToKURL, which preserves the password from the SoupURI. soup_uri_to_string doesn't
        include the password. When calling applyAuthenticationToRequest update the new request. Before
        applyAuthenticationToRequest always updated the firstRequest. Do not call willSendRequest for
        instances when this method is called for authentication handling. willSendRequest should only
        be called for server-side redirects.
        (WebCore::createSoupRequestAndMessageForHandle): Use soup_requester_request_uri instead of
        soup_requester_request. Request::soupURI properly creates a SoupURI with non-null empty strings
        when either the username and password are empty.  A null username or password does not trigger
        the URI-embedded credential override in SoupAuthenticationManager within libsoup. This is important
        because sometimes either the username or password might empty for a request, but the other
        part of the credential should still override the per-session credential storage.
        (WebCore::ResourceHandle::start): We don't need to clear the username and password from the
        internal data structure any longer. These need to be cleared in the CFNetwork backend because
        it prevents the same failed per-request credentials from being used over and over again. In our
        case we don't use these members during didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge, so this isn't an issue.
        (WebCore::ResourceHandle::didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge): Don't look at the per-request
        m_user/m_pass pair here any longer. We use these when initially creating a request, so we don't
        want to re-use them if they fail.

        [Qt] Animation fails on large layers

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        The backing tiles had no upper limit defined for the non-GL backend, which could cause them
        to allocate pixmaps widier or higher than what the underlying graphics systems can handle.

        On top of that GraphicsLayerTextureMapper::prepareBackingStore() would allocate an intermediate
        pixmap the size of the dirty rect, which would at least on the first paint be the size of the
        entire layer, again causing allocation of pixmaps with dimensions outside of platform bounds.

        This patch introduces a limit to the size of image buffer tiles, and adds an alternative path
        for painting where the GraphicsLayer paints directly to the tile instead of over an intermediate
        pixmap. This alternative path can also be useful later to minimize the amount of pixel copying
        happening in full repaints.

        Reviewed by Yury Semikhatsky.

        It was not a good idea to introduce a fake root MemoryObjectInfo.
        It makes a problem when we visit an object without its own MemoryObjectType.

        Example: RenderBox has a global pointer to a hash map.
        HashMap doesn't have its own object type because it is a generic container.
        It will inherit object type from the fake root memory object info.
        The same could happen for another container in another class with other MemoryObjectType.

        This fact forces me to create custom process method for root objects
        because they need to have their own MemoryObjectInfo with customisable memory object type.

        Drive by fix: InstrumentedPointer* was replaced with Wrapper* because actually it is using
        for instrumented and not instrumented object classes.

        [V8] Reachable event listeners on image elements can be collected in a minor DOM GC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104734

        Reviewed by Kenneth Russell.

        A major DOM GC treats image elements specially. In
        V8GCController::opaqueRootForGC(), a major DOM GC puts image elements
        that have pending activities into the same object group of their document.
        This guarantees that image elements that have pending activities
        are not garbage collected in the major DOM GC.

        This patch adds the same special handling to a minor DOM GC to guarantee
        the same thing in the minor DOM GC too.

        In long-term, we might want to remove the special handling by making
        image elements active DOM nodes.

        Enhance the TileCache to cache more tiles
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104612

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Add smarts to the TileCache so that it keeps some tiles around
        for longer and can prepopulate tiles in to-be-scrolled-to regions.

        The new tile management is as follows:
        * As before, we expand the visible rect to create a "tile coverage rect"
        which is twice the width, and three times the height of the visible rect.
        * At the edges, this coverage rect is constrained by them, rather than being
        truncated as before (leading to larger initial tile coverage).
        * When tiles leave the coverage rect, we keep them around but track
        them in cohorts (where a cohort is a set of tiles that left the coverage rect
        at the same time).
        * If a repaint comes in for a "secondary" tile, we don't paint it, but mark
        the tile as being stale. It will get repainted (in full) if it moves back inside
        the coverage rect.
        * Cohorts are kept around for 2 seconds after they were created. A repeating
        1-second timer clears tiles in old cohorts.
        * Secondary tiles are pruned if the visible rect changes, or if zooming happens.
        * TiledBacking exposes a way to prepopulate a rect with tiles; this is called
        when scrolling (e.g. via Home/End keys). Tiles created this way (if outside
        the coverage rect) go into a cohort.

        The bug was caused by ApplyStyleCommand::applyInlineStyleToNodeRange obtaining computed styles while

        2. Remove any conflicting styles, and insert dummy elements at positions where inline styles ought to be
        computed as needed.
        3. Remove the dummy elements and apply ilnine styles as needed.

        Route main resource loads through the memory cache.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Note that this patch doesn't actually enable caching of main resources. That will be done in a later patch.
        The MainResourceLoader actually has an underlying SubresourceLoader (with the cache layer between them).
        In several places, the MainResourceLoader's SubresourceLoader is treated as special.

        No new tests, as this is primarily a refactor. A couple of expected results changed slightly.

        REGRESSION(r121789): Text not wrapping in presence of floating objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101803

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        When determining if a line needs to offset to avoid any floats use RenderBlock::lineHeight() 
        to estimate the height of the line. If the container has floats stacked up with different widths
        that straddle the line, using a height of zero will make the first line think it has
        more width available than it actually does and it will end up extruding from its container.
        
        The logic for finding the offset of inline blocks and images needs to use a similar heuristic.
        So nextLineBreak() now updates the available width if it encounters a replaced element (e.g. inline block,
        image) at the start of a line, using the height of the element to decide which floats to avoid. 
        RenderBlock::computeInlineDirectionPositionsForLine() does the same thing when laying out the line.

        Web Inspector: ConsoleTypes should not expose MessageType - it should be private to inspector.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66371

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        We can simplify console message generation a bit, as nothing outside the
        Console object itself will generate messages of any type other than
        LogMessageType. This patch refactors the externally-facing API endpoints
        on ScriptExecutionContext and Console to drop the MessageType parameter,
        moves the MessageType enum into a new InspectorConsoleTypes.h header,
        and updates all the call sites (and ChromeClients) to drop the parameter
        from their interfaces.

        As a temporary bandage for ports using this interface, this patch
        includes aliases for the new methods that retain the old interface.
        I'll remove them in a future patch.

        Here, we only refactor an internal interface. No tests should break.

        Platform mouse event coordinates are relative to the containing window,
        but the inspector command assumes they follow standard web coordinates,
        where the origin is at the top left of the page and y increases as you
        go down. We convert the coordinates to the window before constructing
        the event. This also fixes the fact that some platforms have flipped
        coordinate systems.

        IsActiveFlag, IsHoverFlag, InActiveChainFlag can be unified.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103697

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        To save two more NodeFlags bits, this patch inroduces
        UserActionElementSet to get IsLinkFlag, IsHoverFlag,
        InActiveChainFlag together. These three old flags are replaced by
        UserActionElementSet::ElementFlags and UserActionElementSet
        collection which tracks elements which are flagged with one of
        a ElementFlags.

        When marking an element as active for example, WebKit sets
        UserActionElementSet::IsActiveFlag to the element and store it
        into corresponding element set of the document. This set maintains
        marked elements and corresponding flags for each elements.

        UserActionElementSet can be seen as a yet another rare data for
        these flags. However, the following characteristics of these flags
        make adding a new data structure on Document an attractive
        alternative:

        - UserActionElementSet is maintained for each Document instead of a
          global collecton. This fits element lifetime better.

        - The number of elements which have these flags is generally
          small, and a group of elements for each flag is largely overlapped
          due to its nature. This property keeps the set small, and lets
          flag retrieval efficient. On majority of the elements, all these
          flags are false thus the check is done by just checking
          IsInUserActionFlag.

        As a bonus, isFocused flag, which was on NodeRareData, is also moved to this model.

        No new tests, covered by existing test.

        Web Inspector: Evaluate private browsing mode's effect on console messages.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104383

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        Two sets of console messages are currently gated on private browsing
        mode being inactive. This patch centralizes the private browsing checks
        in order to apply them equally to all console messages, and changes the
        granularity at which they act.

        The current checks block the console messages entirely. This patch
        blocks only notifications to ChromeClient and ensures that messages
        won't be passed to printf where they might end up in system logs.
        Notifications to InspectorInstrumentation seem safe; so far as I can
        tell, there's no compelling reason to prevent console-based debugging
        in private browsing mode. This patch excludes those calls from the
        private browsing check.

        Node traversal functions are currently Node and ContainerNode members. Their implementations
        are confusingly scattered over multiple header and source files. These functions have no particular
        reason to be members as they don't require non-public access. They should be made freestanding
        function instead and gathered together.
        
        This patch adds NodeTraversal namespace, defined in NodeTraversal.h. It contains freestanding
        functions for traversing Nodes. Most popular functions are inlined (as before) and
        there are ContainerNode specific specializations (as before).
        
        In client code
        
            node = node->traverseNextNode();
            node = node->traverseNextSibling();
        
        becomes

        Frame borders were not correctly invalidated when in tiled drawing mode, because

        as the old code.

        Attempts to make a layout test failed. Resizing composited framesets repainted

        Support for CSS widows and orphans
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9410

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The CSS 'widow' and 'orphan' properties were supported by the parser and
        style system, but were not actually doing anything in layout. Now they do!

        In order to not break existing content, I unfortunately had to go against
        the specification and change our default value from 2 to auto. A value of
        auto means that widows and orphans will not cause any page/column breaks.

        Supporting orphans was a small change. During line layout, if we realise
        we need to move to a new page in a situation that would create an orphan,
        move the entire block to the new page. There was already code to do this.

        Support for widows was trickier. When we finish laying out a block, count
        the number of hanging lines. If we've created a widow, and there are enough
        available lines on the previous page, then steal some and remember the line
        to break at. Trigger a relayout. Then notice the line that was marked for
        breaking and avoid the widow. This means some blocks go through layout
        twice, but as long as the widow value is small it shouldn't be a huge penalty.

        AX: Crash in NSAccessibilityUnignoredDescendant
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104468

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        This crash occurred because AccessibilityScrollView stopped retaining it's ScrollView pointer.

        Unfortunately, there was still a case that didn't correctly clear that variable. 

        That case was when a Frame had a new FrameView associated with it. The old FrameView didn't inform the 
        accessibility object cache that it should be removed. As a result, when the FrameView deallocated and 
        did try to remove, it used the wrong AXObjectCache because it was no longer correctly hooked into the 
        document tree.

        No new tests. Existing tests will stop crashing.

        in the named getter for HTMLCollection. It's a miracle that the old code prior to r137003
        worked at all since the return type of namedItem was different.

        Existing tests cover this.

        The test was failing because the placeholder text was not supported and

        In GraphicsContext3D::paintToCanvas, we flip the contents and draw on the surface.
        The operations done to flip the image (translation and scale) are done before rectangle with correct size
        is added to current path. This resulted in updating pixels at wrong positions.

        Reviewed by Xan Lopez.

        Several improvements:

          - Move g_return macros at the beginning of the methods.
          - Use them only to check parameters of public API.
          - Use GObject macros to check GObjects.
          - Check also GError parameters.
          - Use early returns in kit and core methods, since they should
            work even if g_return macros are disabled handling NULL
            gracefully.

        [GTK] Use a private struct and placement new syntax in GObject DOM bindings
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101074

        Reviewed by Xan Lopez.

        It allows to use RefPtr for the wrapped object and it simplifies
        the code. Only the classes deriving from WebKitDOMObject keep a
        reference of the wrapped object in a private struct. The wrapped
        object is added to the cache in GObjectClass::constructor() and
        removed in GObjectClass::finalize().

        Use background color for GraphicsLayers when applicable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103786

        Updated RenderLayerBacking to call GraphicsLayer::setContentsToBackgroundColor when the following conditions take place:
        1. The layer doesn't paint its own content, other than background/decoration.
        2. There are no borders or other box decorations (border radius, borders, outline, shadow etc.)
        3. The image has only a background color, and no background image.
        4. background-composite is set to source-over, and background-clip is anything apart from text.
        5. The port supports setContentsToBackgroundColor.

        This allows any implementation of GraphicsLayer that supports setContentsToBackgroundColor to avoid allocating a backing store
        for that layer, but instead draw that solid color directly.
        In addition to setting the background color, the layer's contentsRect needs to be adjusted, since the default contents rect of
        a layer is not always equivalent to the rect where the background is supposed to be painted, which is derived from the box's
        background-clip property.

        (WebCore::RenderLayerBacking::updateBackgroundColor):
            Set the background color if applicable, otherwise set to trasnparent and clear.
            This was not needed in the past because background colors were only used for the special case of full-screen.

        (WebCore::supportsDirectBoxDecorationsComposition):
            Helper function to determine whether a particular background can be directly composited. Right now only 
            background color can be composited, and only if the GraphicsLayer implementation supports background colors.
            Also we don't yet support background-clip: text and any background-composite other than source-over.

            GraphicsLayer::contentsRect expects snapped pixels.

        [chromium] ImageDecodingStore should cache partially decoded images
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103796

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Implement caching for incomplete images, meaning the image is partially
        decoded. The image is cached together with partially decoded ImageDecoder.
        This allows decoding to resume in a later time.

        Caching logic for incomplete images is implemented in ImageDecodingStore.

        Logic for resuming image decoding is implemented in ImageFrameGenerator.

        ImageDecodingStore allows storing incomplete image with the decoder.
        The cache entry can be used in a later time to read and write (i.e. resume
        decoding.) To avoid the same entry being written and read at the same time,
        an incomplete entry can be used by one user only. Concurrent access to
        an incomplete entry should never happen and is checked by an assert.
        An entry can becomes complete when decoding is finished. In this case
        the associated decoder is deleted. Once an entry becomes complete concurrent
        read is allowed.

        ImageFrameGenerator performs the logic to resume image decoding. It
        performs the following operations in sequence:
        - Try to lookup a complete image
        - Try to perform scaling on a complete image
        - Try to lookup an incomplete image and resume decoding & scaling
        - Everything fails, start decoding from scratch
        The entire sequence of operations in under a mutex, hence there will be
        no more than 1 user of an incomplete cache entry at the same time.

        New unit tests in ImageDecodingStoreTest and ImageFrameGeneratorTest.

        Use background color for GraphicsLayers when applicable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103786

        Updated RenderLayerBacking to call GraphicsLayer::setContentsToBackgroundColor when the following conditions take place:
        1. The layer doesn't paint its own content, other than background/decoration.
        2. There are no borders or other box decorations (border radius, borders, outline, shadow etc.)
        3. The image has only a background color, and no background image.
        4. background-composite is set to source-over, and background-clip is anything apart from text.
        5. The port supports setContentsToBackgroundColor.

        This allows any implementation of GraphicsLayer that supports setContentsToBackgroundColor to avoid allocating a backing store
        for that layer, but instead draw that solid color directly.
        In addition to setting the background color, the layer's contentsRect needs to be adjusted, since the default contents rect of
        a layer is not always equivalent to the rect where the background is supposed to be painted, which is derived from the box's
        background-clip property.

        Shrink the size of NodeRareData by moving pointers into separate objects

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch does three things:
        1. Move ChildNodeList back into NodeListsNodeData.

        3. Move m_itemProp, m_itemRef, m_itemType & into a separate object owned by NodeRareData.

        Moving m_childNodeList from NodeRareData to NodeListsNodeData also has a nice side-effect of making ChildNodeList
        behave more like other LiveNodeLists.

        MutationRecord addedNodes/removedNodes should never be null

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Per an update to the DOM4 spec that matches Gecko's behavior,
        addedNodes/removedNodes should be empty NodeLists on 'attributes'
        and 'characterData' records, rather than null.

        This is accomplished with lazy initialization of addedNodes/removedNodes

        addition of a new StaticNodeList::createEmpty() factory method.

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        In order for CSS to reference SVG filters that will occur later in
        the document, or will be added at a future time, we need a way to
        notify the target element (the one the filter style is applied to)
        when the correct SVG filter is added to the DOM.
        There is already code for SVG elements that handles this problem, in
        SVGResourcesCache. This patch allows any element to have a reference to
        an SVG element in SVGResourceCache.

        Web Inspector: Add shortcut to set visibility:hidden on elements in the ElementsPanel
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104146

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        This change adds the shortcut H to set and unset visibility:hidden on the inline style
        of elements in the Elementspanel. This feature makes it easier to look for elements that
        cause bad rendering performance, because visibility:hidden does not paint the element,
        but preserves the layout.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        r136754 was landed to fix the problem of checking successively two calc
        values with validUnit. It was asserting as validUnit expect you to use
        the parsed value of the calc after the call. In this case we pre-check the
        background-position longhand to count how many values it has to then
        call the right parsing functions accordingly. While r136754 is not
        wrong it is better to harden isPotentialPositionValue with the real
        expected units and keywords. For this matter we can reuse the
        ReleaseParsedCalcValueCondition enum which was created with the same
        idea as this patch. If you are not interested of the calc parsed
        value when calling validUnit() you can now specify it, I believe it is
        good to have it explicit to avoid mistake in the future.

        Provide the backend for exposing the layer tree to the Web Inspector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103513

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        The purpose of this patch is to provide a new agent enabling the Web Inspector to interface
        with WebCore to access information about the render layer tree and, more specifically, expose
        useful information about layers backed by textures composited on the GPU such as metrics and
        backing store. Thus we now provide a LayerTreeAgent which will inform the front-end of 
        changes to the render layer tree via a new layerTreeDidChange event, providing an object
        containing the entire hierarchy of RenderLayers for the inspected document. This hierarchy 
        can be queried at any time using the .getLayerTree() method on the LayerTreeAgent. Finally, 
        the LayerTreeAgent also exposes a .nodeIdForLayerId() method allowing to get the id of the 
        node associated with the RenderLayer with the provided layer id.
        
        In terms of implementation, RenderLayerCompositor has been changed such that in its 
        updateCompositingLayers() method we call the layerTreeDidChange method on the 
        InspectorLayerTreeAgent instance via the InspectorInstrumentation.

        Patch makes it possible for methods like

        Following the same logic, the patch also fixes RenderBox::canBeScrolledAndHasScrollableArea
        method to take into account the box' scroll allowance in a given direction only
        when it overflows. This allows simplifying custom methods like InRegionScrollerPrivate::canScrollRenderBox

        It may change the disabled state of the upload button in its shadow tree,

        Unify SVG's animation and target tracking systems.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102655

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        This patch unifies our animation target tracking system and regular target tracking system.
        This simplifies the code, fixes a bug, and cleans up a historically security-sensitive area.

        Background: When <use>, <mpath>, <animate>, etc. reference another element using
        xlink:href="#id", we need to track when #id changes to #otherId, when #id is removed, etc.
        This bookkeeping of element -> target is done in SVGDocumentExtensions. Additionally, when
        a target changes that causes layout (e.g., rect.x is changed), all dependent elements with
        renderers are notified (<animate> has no renderer and will not use this).

        Previously, xlink:href changes were lazily resolved when targetElement() was called, target
        changes were tracked using the animation tracking framework, and pending targets did not
        work (e.g., <animate xlink:href="#p"><!--animate is now pending #p --><rect id="p"/>).

        After this patch, we no longer lazily resolve targetElement() but instead change it when
        our xlink:href attribute changes. Instead of using the animation tracking framework in
        SVGDocumentExtensions, we now use the regular target tracking framework. Lastly, by using
        the regular target tracking framework we are able to hook into the pending resource handling
        which fixes a bug (see the test).

        A test has been added to test that the order of animation elements does not matter. A second
        test has been added to show we do not regress a pending-while-pending case.

        Tests: svg/animations/svg-animation-order.html
               svg/custom/svg-pending-twice.html

        * svg/SVGAnimateElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::SVGAnimateElement::setTargetElement):

        Create only NodeRareDataBase when setting TreeScope
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104202

        Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

        Move many fields from NodeRareData into NodeRareDataBase and rename it
        UncommonNodeData and add a flag to determine if a UncommonNodeData is
        actually a full NodeRareData instance. By moving fields up from NodeRareData
        we ensure that this new flag in the base class doesn't make NodeRareData
        grow in size.

        We then make setting the tree scope only allocate the UncommonNodeData
        instead of creating the full NodeRareData or ElementRareData. This is
        important because when putting nodes into ShadowRoot or any descendant
        we must associate the node with a tree scope which adds rare data to the
        node making NodeRareData and ElementRareData not very rare.

        On 64bit, this reduces the overhead per element from 136 bytes to
        32 bytes for a 76% savings, and on other nodes from 64 bytes to 32 bytes
        for a 50% savings.

        [CSS Exclusions] Add support for computing the first included interval position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103327

        Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

        If the first "word" in a line doesn't fit within the shape-inside when lineTop
        is the top of the shape's logical bounding box, adjust lineTop downwards to where
        the word fits.  Currently only rounded rectangle shapes are supported.

        Added ExclusionShape::firstIncludedIntervalLogicalTop(). The new virtual method
        computes the topmost/leftmost location where a line segment with the specified
        minLogicalIntervalSize will fit within the exclusion shape and returns the
        corresponding logical Y coordinate.  The result is additionally constrained to
        be at or below minLogicalIntervalTop. If the segment will not fit anywhere within
        the shape, then false is returned.

        During layout, minLogicalIntervalTop is the nominal top of the line being laid
        out within the exclusion shape.

        RenderBlock::layoutRunsAndFloatsInRange() now calls a new ExclusionShapeInsideInfo
        method, adjustLogicalLineTop(), which uses firstIncludedIntervalLogicalTop() to
        decide if the logical top of the line has to be moved downwards, for the first
        word to fit within the exclusion shape.

        SVG <use> element inside an svg-as-image fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104007

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Upon redraw, SVGImage calls layout on the document it is drawing into
        the image if the image, provided it believes the redraw does not need
        to be delayed. Unfortunately, when an SVG <use> element is modified
        (by animation, say) and regenerates its shadow tree, the destructors
        invoke redraw, causing the SVGImage to call layout on something that
        is in the process of being deleted. That's bad.

        This change causes SVGImage to always delay the redraw. It is the most robust
        way to protect against this problem, as there may be any number of
        ways to cause this issue (a node being deleted in an svg-as-image
        target) and this protects against them all.

        The test case crashes in Asan Chromium.

        We need to use display:inline elements to wrap sub-fields and static
        text in DateTimeEditElement children to apply the Unicode Bidi
        Algorithm.

        Because we can't use display:inline-block for them, we can't specify
        min-width CSS property for them. We stop using customStyleForRenderer of
        sub-fields to specify each of their widths, and use
        customStyleForRenderer of DateTimeEditElement to specify the total
        required width. A sub-field width shrink and grow so that the width fits
        to the field value, and a DateTimeEditElement doesn't.

        Enable background color in GraphicsLayerTextureMapper, and paint it using TextureMapper::drawSolidColor.
        Once https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103786 is enabled, this would enable Qt/GTK/EFL to directly
        composite colors that only have a background color, without having to create a backing store for them.
        This would eliminate the memory usage for those layers, reduce the time needed for them to draw into the

        [skia] Improve performance of GraphicsContext::createCompatibleBuffer by using SkDevice:createCompatibleDevice
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103896

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Refactored GraphicsContext::createCompatibleBuffer (platform common
        code) to use platform-specific implementations provided by ImageBuffer.
        There is no change in behavior for non-skia ports. The skia
        implementation uses skia'a own createCompatibleDevice implementation,
        which offers several performance benefits:
        1. For accelerated contexts, the backing store may be allocated from
        the scratch texture pool, which minimizes texture allocation and
        deallocation overhead.
        2. The backing store will not be initially cleared if it is known
        in advance that fully opaque contents will be drawn into the buffer.
        3. For non-accelerated contexts, if the backing store is flagged as
        opaque, faster blitter loop implementations will be used for drawing
        the buffer contents into other buffers. (e.g. generated opaque gradient
        fills)

        No new tests: covered by existing layout tests

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        css3/calc/background-position-parsing.html assert in debug because we
        call CSSParser::validUnit multiple times in a row. The problem was with
        validUnit which check calc() values and save the result inside
        m_parsedCalculation for later usage. validUnit expects you to
        use m_parsedCalculation therefore calling validUnit again with
        m_parsedCalculation being set asserts. As parseFillBackgroundPosition
        just want to check wether the current value is maybe valid for
        background-position we can just relax the check to allow either the
        valid keywords or any other units (we will anyway filter the incorrect
        values later in the parsing). The most important check at this point
        for the shorthand is the validity of the keyword.

        In texImage2D() and texSubImage2D(), there is a redundant memory copy from Image data to the intermediate vector when no conversion is needed. If the Image resource can be locked properly, it is better to use the pointer to the image source directly and hence avoid the memory copy and improve the performance.

        Add infrastructure for :before and :after in DOM
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103705

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Add all infrastructure for reimplementing generated content :before and
        :after as DOM Elements. Now ElementRareData has two pointers to PseudoElements
        for the generated content and Node has methods for traversing the tree
        including generated content.

        This will allow the generated content to be treated as real nodes instead
        of anonymous and take part in the usual recalcStyle and attach flow which
        fixes many bugs and vastly simplifies the ifecycle of generated content.

        Instead of attempting to land both the infrastructure and enable it at
        the same time which has proven problematic due to how drastic this change
        is, this patch contains only the support code so a much smaller future
        patch can be used to switch it on.

        No new behavior, this is just the infrastructure.

        Encapsulate ElementRareData and make all access go through getters and

        had many places where people directly access it.

        This the first step in possible future sharing of ElementRareData
        instances across nodes. All nodes in a shadow tree have rare data to
        store the TreeScope, but in most cases all they have is the TreeScope!
        Instead of making every node in a shadow subtree have rare data
        and use lots of memory we could just share a single instance of rare data
        and only allocate a unique one on modification. Encapsulation lets us
        assert about mutations on shared instances.

        [CSS Exclusions] Enable shape-inside for multiple-segment polygons
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91878

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Patch adding support for multiple-segment polygons for shape-insides from
        the CSS Exclusions specification. The layout code has been modified to first
        support dividing text into multiple segments per line, and then to lay out
        multiple segments per line box.

        the given segment of text and calculates its layout offsets.

        Now that bug 100650 has made it possible for ConsoleMessage to generate

        This patch also removes an unused addConsoleMessage variant from
        ScriptExecutionContext, which should have been removed from the patch to

        REGRESSION(r126683): Table cell are getting borders when the style doesn't mention any
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101677

        Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

        The bordercolor attribute on a cell or row has no effect on FF and Opera, even when the parent
        table has a border attribute. IE displays the bordercolor of the cell and row in all cases except when
        the parent has no border attribute. WebKit's old behaviour (before r126683) was to display the
        bordercolor of the row but not the cells (I don't think this behaviour was particularly deliberate). No
        browser displays the bordercolor for a col or tbody element.

        Bring WebKit into line with Opera and FF by ignoring the bordercolor attribute on cells, rows, cols, rowgroups, and
        colgroups in all cases, regardless of whether the table has a border or not.

        For ports using ENABLE(IMAGE_DECODER_DOWN_SAMPLING), turbo swizzle decodes provide
        no speed-up when the decoded image will be down sampled because the data must pass
        through the buffer.setRGBA() slow path. That is not the swizzled path. Instead use
        JCS_RGB decodes to clarify the output color space handling in outputScanlines().

        Web Inspector: Autogenerate stack traces and line numbers when possible.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100650

        Reviewed by Yury Semikhatsky.

        Console messages generated in WebCore generally are asked to do a bit of
        work in order to provide a developer with a detailed report. We ask the
        caller to either generate stack traces, or pass in a url/line number
        pair, which can be a bit of work. Predictably, most callers don't pass
        in what we'd like to see.

        This patch creates a new, simpler console message generation API that we
        expect most call sites to use. Source, type, level, and message are
        required, and an optional request ID can be passed in. Everything else
        will be autogenerated inside ConsoleMessage when appropriate.

        In a subsequent patch, we expect to be able to trim down more of the
        external call sites (ContentSecurityPolicy springs to mind) in order to
        further consolidate the external interface. Simple is good.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103576

        Reviewed by Emil A Eklund.

        According to the CSS box model specification, all percentage margin & padding values,
        including top & bottom, should be resolved based on the containing block's width.
        http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#margin-properties
        The writing modes specification has refined this definition to use the containing
        block's logical width to resolve percentage margin & padding values.
        http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#dimension-mapping

        Previously, positioned elements measured their container in the element's block
        direction (containerLogicalHeight) to resolve margin-before/after, and in the inline
        direction (containerLogicalWidth) to resolve margin-start/end. This patch measures the

        Previously we only tested for clicks inside frame scrollbars before

        Now clicking inside a scrollbar only moves the focus when the scrollbar
        has an ancestor that is mouse focusable.

        This matches Gecko behavior, and was agreed to be the most sensible for now:

        [v8] Improve worker.postMessage() string performance: avoid utf8 conversion
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102230

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Avoid utf8 conversion when serializing strings with SerializedScriptValue. Provide 
        Ascii and UChar writers for v8 string serialization and provide a UChar reader for
        deserialization. Define/use serialization StringUCharTag to indicate UChar strings
        in the wire format. Increment the SerializedScriptValue wire format version.

        In the wire format, StringUCharTag is followed by the string length in bytes, then
        the length/2 UChars of the string.

        Note the string length is VarInt encoded. During serialization, compute the number
        of bytes used to encode the length and prepend a PaddingTag if needed so the UChar
        data appears on an even-byte boundary. This prevents unaligned reads of UChar data
        during deserialization (the deserialization buffer is even-byte aligned).

        Testing transfers of large strings to and from workers indicates a 10X improvement
        in transfer rate for strings, and strings within js objects, with this change. For
        example, 500 MByte/s on my test machine (50 MByte/s without this change) for flat,
        32 MByte string postMessage() transfers.

        Refactor Media Control Elements to remove code duplication.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101877

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Instead of having two different types of inheritance trees for
        MediaControlElement and MediaControlInputElement, this
        creates a stand-alone virtual class MediaControlElement that
        provides the common functions: show(), hide(), isShowing(),
        setMediaController(), displayType(), isMediaControlElement(),
        shadowPseudoId(), mediaController(), setDisplayType().

        The individual elements inherit from MediaControlElement and
        either HTMLInputElement or HTMLDivElement. They extend/override
        the base functions as appropriate.

        As part of this, the RenderXXX classes mixed in between the media
        controls in MediaControlElements.cpp are also moved to
        rendering/RenderMediaControls.h/cpp to follow common code separation.

        This patch moves a number of functions from inside the class
        declaration to below the class declaration. I've also inlined
        domWrapperType into each of its callers and renamed a few functions.
        A subsequent patch will improve the names of the remaining functions.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Implement CSS parsing and handling for <track-minmax>
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103799

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        This change adds support for:
        <track-minmax> => minmax( <track-breadth> , <track-breadth> ) | auto | <track-breadth>
        (note that we already supported auto | <track-breadth>).

        The change is mostly mechanical, the only newness is that GridTrackSize was updated to
        hold 2 Lengths internally and we map the single Length case to 2 by duplicating the value
        as this matches the rendering algorithm in the spec.

        parser* methods in ContainerNode should not support DocumentFragment

        Only parserInsertBefore ever supported DocumentFragment and this feature

        it was created as a copy of insertBefore that didn't fire events. This
        patch removes that code and adds assertions that we never pass
        DocumentFragments since doing so would cause a corrupted tree as we never
        check checkAcceptChild or do other validation in the parser methods.

        Stale SVGUseElement reference in CachedResource::checkNotify()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104004

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        SVGUseElement tracks one CachedSVGDocument at a time (for external references), but when
        the href attribute is updated it fails to unregister with the current CachedSVGDocument
        and only updates its CachedSVGDocument with the new instance. This leaves an untracked
        reference with the original CachedSVGDocument.

        The patch adds the missing removeClient() call on href change, and encapsulates the
        CachedSVGDocument manipulation in a helper method which handles the necessary cleanup.

        Redrawing issue with inserting new inline element between existing inline elements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50315

        Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

        When inserting an element such as '<span>text<br></span>' between two lineboxes, the second of which has leading space
        collapsed away after a line-break, dirtyLinesFromChangeChild() needs to ensure that the linebox the fragment is inserted into (the second 
        of the two lineboxes) gets dirtied. 
        
        Since the element has been inserted before the first element in the linebox, but after the collapsed leading
        space, the search for the new element's linebox will go past the leading space to the previous linebox and select that
        one by mistake.
        
        So in order to ensure the element's linebox is dirtied make sure its previous sibling is not the line-break object of the
        linebox we selected when searching for a linebox to dirty. If the previous sibling is the linebox's line-break object then
        the element is in the one after the one we selected and we should dirty that linebox too.

        While the HTML "kind" attribute on the <track> element allows upper-case values, the related APIs
        on HTMLMediaElement and TextTrack expect only to deal with lower-case values. As such, we're updating
        TextTrack::isValidKindKeyword() to be case-sensitive and ensure that values fed from the DOM (the values
        read from HTML attributes) are lower-case'd.

        Thanks to this fix, we're no longer skipping media/track/opera/interfaces/TextTrack/kind.html and
        media/track/opera/interfaces/HTMLElement/HTMLMediaElement/addTextTrack.html 

        This patch also fixes https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103256.

        This change emulates the CSS media types through the instrumentation of FrameView::mediaType().
        Even though it already checks the associated FrameLoaderClient::overrideMediaType(), instrumenting

        The code figuring out whether fixed position layers are inside

        the size of the layout viewport. This assumption doesn't hold with
        how the Qt and EFL tiled backing store and coordinated graphics

        Floating list items are often used to implement horizontal menus. Currently, text autosizing 
        disregards such elements as autosizing containers. List items are often then autosized as part
        of a bigger cluster (usually the whole page) and look too big.
        This change turns floating list items into autosizing clusters so they are autosized separately

        [mathml] Improve performance of nested sup or sub elements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103665

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Reduce the number of extra layouts. Since RenderMathMLSubSup calls
        layout twice, this can lead to an exponential number of layouts. Avoid
        extra layouts.

        Test: mathml/presentation/sup-nested.html - Should not time out.

        * css/mathml.css:
        (msup): Stretching children also causes extra layouts. Avoid this by aligning to the top.
        (msub): Same as msup, but align to the bottom.

        (WebCore::RenderMathMLSubSup::layout): Only do the second layout if the padding changed.

        setChildNeedsLayout (since we're calling it on a child).

        The emma attribute is supposed to move from SpeechRecognitionResult to the SpeechRecognitionEvent,

        Web Inspector: Autogenerate stack traces and line numbers when possible.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100650

        Reviewed by Yury Semikhatsky.

        Console messages generated in WebCore generally are asked to do a bit of
        work in order to provide a developer with a detailed report. We ask the
        caller to either generate stack traces, or pass in a url/line number
        pair, which can be a bit of work. Predictably, most callers don't pass
        in what we'd like to see.

        This patch creates a new, simpler console message generation API that we
        expect most call sites to use. Source, type, level, and message are
        required, and an optional request ID can be passed in. Everything else
        will be autogenerated inside ConsoleMessage when appropriate.

        In a subsequent patch, we expect to be able to trim down more of the
        external call sites (ContentSecurityPolicy springs to mind) in order to
        further consolidate the external interface. Simple is good.

        [CSS Regions] regionlayoutupdate event fires continuously
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102101

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        According to the CSSRegions spec, http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-regions/#region-flow-layout-events, the regionlayoutupdate event
        should be dispatched when there is a possible layout change in the region chain.
        In the current implementation, regionlayoutupdate is dispatched when:
        1. a region from region chain changed its regionOverset value
        2. a region from region chain has regionOverset = fit| overset

        In the case of a named flow having an auto-height region with regionOverset = fit, the second step of layout was done
        also when there was not required, therefore the regionlayoutuodate was unnecessary triggered.

        We should proceed with the 2-pass layout only if the flow-thread having auto-height regions in region chain needs layout.

        documentElement should not always get a renderer

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        Only SVG documents need a renderer on the documentElement when it's
        display: none. This behavior is wrong, but there's assumptions in
        FrameView and SVGImage that depend on a RenderSVGRoot existing for all
        loaded SVG document and images.

        The current code has logic that makes it appear as if we always create
        a renderer for the documentElement even when it's display: none, but
        because HTMLElement::createRenderer doesn't call super we end up with
        HTMLElement::rendererIsNeeded returning true for display: none, but
        HTMLElement::createRenderer returning null.

        Instead of this generic documentElement logic only special case SVG
        until someone can fix Bug 103493 so we don't need it.

        WebGL: Add a class to abstract the status of the Image in texImage2D() and texSubImage2D()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103606

        Reviewed by Kenneth Russell.

        In texImage2D() and texSubImage2D() for WebGL, the status of the Image is extracted and kept in the function GraphicsContext3D::getImageData() but provides no interface or guaranteed way to use the status of the Image outside GraphicsContext3D::getImageData() safely. For example, you can not get the address of the raw Image data and operate it outside the scope of the GraphicsContext3D::getImageData() and there is at least one memory copy existed from the Image to the intermediate vector.
       This patch refactors the code by adding a ImageExtractor class to abstract and keep the status of the Image. The lifetime and validity of Image status are determined by the lifetime of the object instead of the scope of getImageData(). It provides flexibility on future optimizations.

        No new tests. It is a code refactoring patch.

        Made updateLayerPosition() private. The only external caller was
        MouseRelatedEvent::computeRelativePosition(), which has no business updating
        layer positions. In fact it had positively dangerous behavior; doing just
        a style update without layout, and then calling absoluteToLocal() and walking
        layers. Fixed by having it call updateLayoutIgnorePendingStylesheets().
        
        This revealed a bug where event.offsetX/offsetY could be wrong in some cases.
        fast/events/stopPropagation-submit.html does a simulated click (which has
        client coordinates at 0,0), so the image submit coordinates were incorrectly

        Late-loading stylesheets can cause composited layers to be blank

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Early painting can be short-circuited in RenderBlock::paintContents() if we know a stylesheet
        is pending, which is done to avoid a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). When the stylesheet
        finally loaded, Document::styleResolverChanged() would try to repaint everything by calling
        repaint() on the RenderView(). In a composited world, however, this repaint() doesn't repaint
        composited layers.
        
        This was particularly prevalent on this specific URL because it failed to load
        a CSS file from typekit.com, so Document::styleResolverChanged()
        just did the repaint and returned (rather than doing a recalc style as would
        happen for correctly loaded stylesheets).
        
        Fix by making a way to repaint all compositing layers, and calling it
        from Document::styleResolverChanged().

        IndexedDB: Replace use of ScriptExecutionContext::Task (Part 1)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101483

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        The IDB back end (which runs on a single thread) makes use of ScriptExecutionContext's
        Task and facilities for cross-task posting with callbacks, and requires decorating various
        IDB classes with "ThreadSafe" when they are not. Move towards encapsulating the tasks
        in "Operation" classes which are IDB-operation specific.

        Part 1 (this patch) retains the use of ScriptExecutionContext::Task but wraps the creation
        and the callback function in an Operation class which will be fleshed out in later patches.
        As an aside, a little bit of RefPtr churn is eliminated, and IDB_TRACE sprinkled in.

        No new tests - just a refactor.

        IndexedDB: Propagate more leveldb errors to script
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103580

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        LevelDBDatabase used a single return value to indicate both I/O problems
        and a missing key. Now an out variable is used to indicate if the
        requested key was found. The return value is used to report corruption
        or disk error.

        This is a small step toward propagating low level errors everywhere
        possible. So far only one scenario will newly cause script to receive
        an error: when leveldb has trouble looking for existing keys during an
        objectstore->add.

        Avoid painting lots of small rects in WebLayer painting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103673

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r109186 added code in drawLayerContents() to enumerate over the rects in
        the CALayer's dirty region, and paint them individually. This was done
        to help performance on the IE Maze Solver test.
        
        On large, complex pages like Facebook, the overhead of traversing the
        RenderLayer tree for painting is such that it's better to paint a single,
        or fewer rects rather than lots of little ones.
        
        So adopt a heuristic similar to that in DrawingArea, where if the
        combined area of the small rects is 75% or more of the combined rect,
        just paint the combined rect. Also paint the combined rect if there
        are more than 5 individual rects.
        
        I verified that this preserves the optimization for IE Maze Solver.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Refactor the WebCore authentication dialog so that it can be reused for the WebKit2
        embedded authentication dialog. The main purpose of this refactor is so that the
        dialog does not rely on GtkDialog to add the action buttons to the dialog itself.
        This also simplifies the structure of the dialog, using the GtkTable or GtkGrid to
        contain more of the widget elements, greatly simplifying this code. We also expose
        a new constructor that does not create the parent GtkDialog -- so that WebKit2
        can embed the dialog directly into the WebView.

        No new tests. This shouldn't change behavior, only slightly the look of the authentication

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Under various conditions, frameAtIndex (and therefore,
        nativeImageForCurrentFrame) returns null. A series of bugs over
        the years has ensured null returns are handled in some cases,
        but there are a handful of remaining cases where this is still a
        problem. 

        No new tests, as these low-level functions are covered by
        numerous existing test cases.

        [CSS Regions] Fix content node renderers ordering inside the named flow thread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103501

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch fixes two issues with how content nodes renderers are added to a named flow thread.
        The first issue was about determining the insertion position of a renderer inside the children list of a named flow thread. Before this patch, the
        insertion point was based on both the DOM ordering of the elements and insertion order of previous renderers.
        The patch fixes this and makes the renderer position just a function of the DOM ordering of elements.
        The second issue appeared when next/previousRenderer methods were skipping nodes because they had the flow-into property as a side effect
        of copying the style of the parent element (e.g. Text nodes). The patch ensures the skipped nodes are also elements.

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        We would like to shrink the ShadowRoot memory size in this patch. ShadowRoot had several distribution related members,
        however they were used only if ShadowRoot has <content>, <shadow>, or nested ShadowRoot.
        Since <input> or <textarea> do not have such requirements, the members consume a few amount of memory.

        We remove them from ShadowRoot and introduce some RareData-like data structure for ShadowRoot.

        checkAcceptChild() needs fewer virtual calls
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103372

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        This change reorganizes checkAcceptChild family for speed.

        - Made Node::checkAddChild and Node::checkReplaceChild() static inline functions
          in ContainerNode.cpp. checkAcceptChild() was also moved to the same file. This allows us
          more aggressive inlining.

        - Added a fast path in checkAcceptChild(), where we can assume that the parent is element
          and the new child is element or text. Under this assumption, we need no extra type checks
          and just needs a cycle prevention through Node::contains(). This is faster than current generic version.

        - Moved extra checks from checkAddChild() and checkReplaceChild() to
          checkAcceptChild(). This allows the fast path skips even these extra checks.

        - Node::canReplaceChild() is devirtualized. Since the only override is on
          Document, we can check isDocumentNode() to call it directly.

        - The default implemenation of Node::canReplaceChild() just calls isChildTypeAllowed().
          That is what an extra check for checkAddChild() did. So we can share these code path in checkAcceptChild().

        This gains 2-3% win on Dromaeo dom-modify.html.

        Harmonize the syntax of '-webkit-mask' property with 'background' according to the

        [CSS Regions] Crash when using hover and first-letter inside a flow-thread
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102957

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Some RenderObjects use a different path when they are destroyed. That's because they are dynamically
        added just before layout happens and their parent is usually not their actual owner. In those cases the parent
        will remove the object from the tree, but it's actually the owner that will destroy the object and all its
        children.

        RenderFlowThread maintains a RenderBoxRegionInfo object for each RenderObject that is rendered inside the
        flow-thread. When the RenderObject is removed from the RenderFlowThread, the associated RenderBoxRegionInfo object
        also needs to be removed.

        In these special cases (list-marker, first-letter), the object itself was removed from the RenderFlowThread,
        but its children were still left in the flow-thread. When the these special objects were later destroyed, 
        they will remove their own children. Removing their children means it will try to remove them from the
        associated RenderFlowThread. However, in this cases there would be no link back to the parent flow-thread,
        as the tree is now detached from the enclosing RenderFlowThread.

        Added code that recursively removes the whole children tree from the RenderFlowThread when the root is removed.

        Some render objects use the "inRenderFlowThread" during the first styleWillChange/styleDidChange.

        When a touch-scroll starts, the node under the touch-point gets latched, and

        removed while the gesture event is in progress (e.g. in a dynamically updated
        list), then the scrolling stops, although there are enough elements to still
        enable scrolling. So instead of latching on to the node immediately under the
        touch point, latch on to the scrollable node under the touch point.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103497

        This is a temporary workaround for an issue with GraphicsSurfaceMac.
        GraphicsSurfaceMac is currently implemented using CGL only.
        CGL does not allow us to properly restore the NSView a context was made current with.
        Therefore we have to go through QOpenGLContext to ensure the context
        is being restored correctly.
        As soon as we are updating GraphicsSurfaceMac to use NSOpenGL,
        we should revert this patch.

        GraphicsLayer::FlushCompositingState() can be called by RenderLayerBacking. It

        However, GraphicsLayerTextureMapper::updateBackingStore() expects that TextureMapper

        needs to be aware of when individual IDBRequests have dispatched to script or track pending

        [CSS Regions] Elements using transforms are not repainted correctly when rendered in a region
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102826

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        When the page is composited, all the elements will have a composited repaint container. In that case we will
        never catch the repaints in the RenderFlowThread, but they will go directly to the RenderView. 
        There's a single case when the parent composited layer of an element inside the RenderFlowThread will get 
        its own repaints. That case only happens when the parent composited layer is also part of the same flow thread.
        Right now compositing is disabled for elements inside the RenderFlowThread, so that case doesn't even happen yet.

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        The shadow DOM for input sliders would have a hidden div (the TrackLimiterElement)
        the size of the thumb which would limit the position of thumb since the width of
        the thumb takes up space in the track. This patch simplifies the shadow DOM by
        removing this hidden div and computing the position of the thumb taking the size of
        the thumb into account.

        [chromium] Implement full-featured image cache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99784

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Implement a thread-safe image cache to be used with deferred image
        decoding. Image cache can now be accessed on any thread.

        The patch implements the following logic:
        1. Mutex to protect all cache operations.
        2. Cache indexing using key (ImageFrameGenerator*, SkISize scaledSize)
        3. Cache lookup.
        4. Cache insertion.
        5. Generation of cache entry by scaling full size image.
        6. Generation of cache entries by decoding and scaling.

        Classes involved:

        ImageDecodingStore

        Responsible for owning cache entries and indexing. Pruning and memory
        management will be added later.

        ImageFrameGenerator

        Responsible for generating new cache enties and insert them into
        ImageDecodingStore.

        LazyDecodingPixelRef

        Responsible for cache lookup and lazy generation of cache entries
        using ImageFrameGenerator. There is a mutex to protect concurrent
        lock operations.

        These items are not implemented in this patch:
        1. Cache pruning.
        2. Setting cache memory limit.
        3. Cache deletion.
        4. Caching incomplete images and ImageDecoder.

        Unit tests added in ImageFrameGeneratorTest.cpp.
        Layout tests are under platform/chromium/virtual/fast/images.

        Canvas does not draw any text if the font is not fully loaded yet
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103392

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        Update CanvasRenderingContext2D::drawTextInternal() so that the
        text is being drawn, even if custom fonts are still being loaded.
        Without this, WebKit was not drawing any text on the canvas if
        the needed font is custom and is not fully loaded yet. This seems
        broken.

        The new behavior is according to specification:
        http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html

        The specification says: "If a font is used before it is fully
        loaded, or if the font style source object does not have that
        font in scope at the time the font is to be used, then it must be
        treated as if it was an unknown font, falling back to another as
        described by the relevant CSS specifications."

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        In Chromium, when an extension script cancels a network
        request (which happens out of process), we'd like to
        notify content scripts running on the current page about
        which elements failed to load because the requests were
        cancelled (as opposed to e.g. the network request just
        didn't work). Since the resource request itself does not
        carry any information what DOM element is was made for,
        currently a content script has to search the DOM tree and
        guess which requests will be cancelled by its counter
        part. By adding these callbacks, the embedder can make
        this connection explictly.

        Incorrect value of CSSStyleDeclaration#length when a shorthand property is inherit or initial
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73002

        Reviewed by Alexis Menard.

        Before the patch, "inherit" and "initial" shorthands would get added to the StylePropertySet as-is, their longhands unspecified.
        This patch tackles two aspects of the problem:
        - When parsing "initial" and "inherit" shorthands, their longhands are added to the property set with the corresponding values.
        - When querying "initial" and "inherit" shorthands, their values are reconstructed from the longhands as usual, but if all of the longhands
          are found to have the same explicit "initial" or "inherit" value, the respective single value is returned as the shorthand value.

        When reconstructing shorthands, a "common value" is tracked. If all longhands involved have the same explicit value, it becomes the
        "common value", otherwise it is a String(). The "inherit" or "initial" common value ultimately becomes the shorthand value
        (except for the "background-position" shorthand, which is a special case).

        * css/CSSParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::parseKeywordValue): Parse shorthands' "initial" and "inherit" values using the CSSParser.
        (WebCore::CSSParser::addExpandedPropertyForValue): Add simple property or all sharthand's longhands with given value and priority.
        (WebCore::CSSParser::parseValue): For "initial" and "inherit" shorthands, add their longhands with the respective value, not the shorthands proper.
        * css/CSSParser.h: Add addExpandedPropertyForValue().
        * css/StylePropertySet.cpp:
        (WebCore::isInitialOrInherit): Check if the value is "initial" or "inherit".
        (WebCore):
        (WebCore::StylePropertySet::appendFontLonghandValueIfExplicit): Modified to track the common value for the "font" shorthand.
        (WebCore::StylePropertySet::fontValue): Ditto.

        (WebCore::StylePropertySet::getLayeredShorthandValue): Use the common value approach for layered shorthands.
        (WebCore::StylePropertySet::getShorthandValue): Ditto for ordinary shorthands.
        (WebCore::StylePropertySet::borderPropertyValue): Ditto for the "border" shorthand.
        * css/StylePropertySet.h: Modify the appendFontLonghandValueIfExplicit() signature.
        * html/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.cpp:
        (WebCore::CanvasRenderingContext2D::setFont): Now that "inherit" and "initial" shorthands are represented by their longhands,
        we need to check the string value of the "font" shorthand for being "inherit" or "initial" instead: getPropertyCSSValue() no longer works,
        since the shorthand itself is no longer added to the StylePropertySet.

        Implement ValidityState::badInput
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102861

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Add ValidityState::badInput, add hasBadInput, which always returns
        false, to FormAssociatedElement, HTMLInputElement, and InputType.

        For NumberInputType, we had hasUnacceptableValue, which was a hack to
        make an input element match to :invalid if the element had non-number
        strings. We don't need the hack any more because badInput affects :invalid
        style. hasUnacceptableValue is re-used for hasBadInput implementation.
        We cleared invalid numbers when elements lost focus to tell users that
        the element had invalid numbers. We don't need this behavior because the
        interactive validation tells it.

        For date/time input types, we should make an input badInput when the
        input has empty value but its sub-fields have values. It covers both of
        partial input cases such as 12/--/2012 and invalid dates such as
        02/31/2012.

        For other types, ValidityState::badInput always returns false.

        This patch doesn't contain tests for badInput validation messages. They
        will be added later.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103350

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        We supported :read-only and :read-write only for text form controls;
        i.e. <textarea> and text-field <input>. According to [1], we should
        support them for date/time types. So, this patch removes
        isTextFormControl check in SelectorChecker, and just relies on
        shouldMatchRead{Only,Write}Selector virtual functions.

        Tests: Update fast/forms/*/*-appearance-pseudo-classes.html.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103297

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        GraphicsLayerTextureMapper and CoordinatedGraphicsLayer set the visibility of a
        mask layer in setContentsVisible() and setMaskLayer() like setting a size.
        This patch is needed because RenderLayerBacking does not set the visibility to a
        mask layer like the size.

        This patch does not change user experience because an invisible layer is not
        rendered although the mask layer is rendered. In that sense, it is an
        optimization patch.

        No new tests. It is an optimization patch.

        GraphicsContext3D's pushGroupMarkerEXT() is being called every time
        an ImageBuffer is created, leading to unlimited memory growth, since
        they share a common GraphicsContext3D.  It should be called only once,
        on context creation.

        [chromium] Implement full-featured image cache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99784

        Reviewed by James Robinson.

        Implement a thread-safe image cache to be used with deferred image
        decoding. Image cache can now be accessed on any thread.

        The patch implements the following logic:
        1. Mutex to protect all cache operations.
        2. Cache indexing using key (ImageFrameGenerator*, SkISize scaledSize)
        3. Cache lookup.
        4. Cache insertion.
        5. Generation of cache entry by scaling full size image.
        6. Generation of cache entries by decoding and scaling.

        Classes involved:

        ImageDecodingStore

        Responsible for owning cache entries and indexing. Pruning and memory
        management will be added later.

        ImageFrameGenerator

        Responsible for generating new cache enties and insert them into
        ImageDecodingStore.

        LazyDecodingPixelRef

        Responsible for cache lookup and lazy generation of cache entries
        using ImageFrameGenerator. There is a mutex to protect concurrent
        lock operations.

        These items are not implemented in this patch:
        1. Cache pruning.
        2. Setting cache memory limit.
        3. Cache deletion.
        4. Caching incomplete images and ImageDecoder.

        Unit tests added in ImageFrameGeneratorTest.cpp.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Animated SVG attributes used to be synchronized by using DOM API which could use unwanted re-entrancy
        via callbacks below Element::attributeChanged(). The "is synchronizing SVG attributes" flag was used
        to protect against such re-entrancy.

        These days, lazy attributes are synchronized using Element::setSynchronizedLazyAttribute() to avoid
        issues like this. The flag does nothing, so we can just remove it.

        For LongPress, we simulate drag by sending a mouse down and mouse drag

        behavior for LongPress). For LongTap, we use the existing functions that
        LongPress uses to summon the context menu. LongPress initiated drag and
        drop can be enabled/disabled by the platform using the Setting
        touchDragDropEnabled which is disabled by default.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        The clipboard utilities code uses std::min with one unsigned int parameter and one size_t parameter.
        This causes a problem when compiling for 64-bit Windows because the two types are not the same size.
        To resolve this issue, we specify the template type as the type the return value is being cast into

        [CSS Regions] Add Region info for RootLineBoxes and pack the pagination data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101332

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Currently the pagination information for lines is spread between the RootInlineBox and InlineFlowBox classes, consuming memory even though
        the boxes were not the result of an pagination layout. To overcome this, a new struct (LineFragmentationData) is created that wraps all the data,
        including two new members, the containing Region for the line and a boolean that states if the line was laid out in a Region or not.
        The flag is necessary because the sanitize function on LineFragmentationData resets the containing Region to 0 if the Region was removed from
        chain (so a value of 0 for the containing Region means two things). The sanitize function should prevent access to an invalid address.
        The containing Region is used to detect if a line changed the Region where it resides. This will be helpful especially when implementing region
        styling for layout properties (e.g. the font-size property https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95559 ).
        A line can change the region when it is shifted inside the containing block or if the entire block moves. This means it's better to delegate
        the task of updating the containing Region to the block.

        This patch moves all methods in WorkerContextExecutionProxy

        Due to the dependency between WorkerContextExecutionProxy's methods,

        This patch simply moves methods without changing their logic.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103195

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        HTMLInputElement::subtreeHasChanged is called only if the input is
        a text field. The code should be moved to TextFieldInputType.

        No new tests. This should not change any behavior.

        * html/HTMLInputElement.cpp:
        - Remove unnecessary NumberInputType.h inclusion.
        - Remove convertFromVisibleValue. It was used only by subtreeHasChanged.
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::subtreeHasChanged):
        Move the code to TextFieldInputType::subtreeHasChanged except
        calculateAndAdjustDirectionality, which is a protected member of
        HTMLElement.

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        Rename DynamicNodeList to LiveNodeList to match the terminology used in DOM4 working draft:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120405/#concept-collection-live
        "A collection (either NodeList or HTMLCollection) can be either live or static".

        Also rename DynamicNodeListCacheBase to LiveNodeListBase, and merge DynamicSubtreeNodeList
        into LiveNodeList (old DynamicNodeList) now that the only difference between those two classes
        is the former calling registerNodeListCache and unregisterNodeListCache on Document.

        This patch completes the series of simplification of NodeList/HTMLCollection classes.

        Changing position:relative to position:static results in mis-positioned div

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        When a block changes position from relative to static it is no longer the containing block for any
        positioned objects it may have. If any of those positioned objects actually have a position specified
        they are going to need a layout as their new containing block will likely have a different location they
        need to offset from. Positioned objects without a specified position always get a layout anyway 
        in layoutPositionedObjects() so no need to worry about them in this situation.

        Make renderer construction less generic
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103175

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        The renderer construction code currently operates on Nodes and is very generic. In reality
        only Element and Text nodes can have renderers and the Text case is much simpler.

        This patch separates the Text and Element renderer construction paths and makes it statically
        known that other Node types can't have renderers. Less generic code is less branchy and enables
        further optimizations.

        Made DynamicNodeListCacheBase inherit from NodeList. While HTMLCollection doesn't inherit
        from NodeList in IDL, it makes a lot of sense for the C++ implementation to do so via
        DynamicNodeListCacheBase since HTMLCollection and live NodeList share a lot of code in
        DynamicNodeListCacheBase.

        This lets remove proxies for item() and length() in DynamicNodeList and HTMLCollection
        and directly implement them in DynamicNodeListCacheBase which used to provide itemCommon()
        and lengthCommon().

        Also renamed NodeList::itemWithName() to NodeList::namedItem() to match HTMLCollection's
        naming convention.

        Finally, removed reportMemoryUsage in DynamicNodeList::reportMemoryUsage since DynamicNodeList

        The list ordering is also slightly altered so that the
        cached parts that were used last come first. Previously,
        they were sorted by creation time which may cause an
        item to be removed from the cache because it is older

        [CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders] Implement new CSS3 background-position parsing.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102104

        Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

        Implement the parsing of the CSS3 background-position property which
        allows to specify up to four values to position the background. It is
        documented here :
        http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-background-position . I
        decided to split up the patch is two pieces, the parsing and later I
        will do the rendering. I kept the old code as much as possible (i.e.
        the two values parsing) as it is used not only by background-position
        but by few other properties. The new four values support is only valid
        on the property itself but does not work on the shorthand.

        Opera has already implemented this feature.

        I extended backgrounds/background-position-parsing-2.html to cover the
        new possible values as well as buggy values.

        Adding occlusion detection to reduce overdraw in RenderBox background rendering

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Adding hasAlpha method to all classes dervived from CSSImageValue and
        StyleImage, in order to support occlusion testing. 
        This allows the FillLayer recursion to stop early when an opaque layer
        is encountered while applying a CSS background style. This also allows
        the elimination of background color application when the background is
        completely covered by an image.  The optimization also skips the

        [TexMap] Remove dependency of TextureMapperLayer on GraphicsLayerTextureMapper.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103046

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        It is a preparation patch for Threaded Coordinated Graphics on WK1.

        We want to make TextureMapperLayer into an actor model. After making an actor
        model, GraphicsLayerTextureMapper and LayerTreeRenderer will communicate with
        TextureMapperLayer using message passing. In the first step, we want to hide
        GraphicsLayerTextureMapper from TextureMapperLayer.

        There are 2 kinds of dependencies of TextureMapperLayer in GraphicsLayerTextureMapper.
        1. To query layer states
        2. To paint layer contents

        In this patch, we removed the second dependency. Currently, TextureMapperLayer
        requests painting contents to GraphicsLayerTextureMapper in WK1 while
        Coordinated Graphics prepares the contents in LayerTreeRenderer. This patch
        makes WK1 prepare the contents in GraphicsLayerTextureMapper like
        LayerTreeRenderer.

        We will remove the first dependency in a follow-up patch.

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        No longer consider overflow != visible as requiring an independent
        cluster. Some sites (e.g. reddit.com) wrap ordinary blocks (such as
        comments) in overflow:hidden or overflow:auto, for various reasons
        (like allowing it to be scrollable, or clipping an element that sticks
        out). These reasons are not sufficient justification for a new cluster.

        On reddit.com this means that comments will all get the same multiplier,
        rather than being independently assigned a variety of multipliers based
        on how much text each comment contains (etc), which significantly

        [Qt] Separate QWidget dependant code into separate WebKitWidgets static library
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102800

        Reviewed by Tor Arne Vestbø.

        This patch separates code that needs to use QWidget related APIs in
        WebKit/qt/WebCoreSupport and Api from code that doesn't. This means for
        example FrameLoaderClientQt.cpp remains in the WebKit1 static library,
        while qwebpage.cpp and qwebframe.cpp become part of the WebKitWidgets
        static library. WebKit1 is compiled without QT += widgets and therefore
        any widget related dependency has been moved "up" and out of WebKit1 into
        the WebKitWidgets library.

        Between the code in WebKit.a and WebKitWidgets.a new adapters and
        interfaces have been introduced, such as QWebPageAdapter and
        QWebFrameAdapter. QWebPageAdapter, when used from WebKit1, is a way to
        call out into the API layer, implemented by QWebPage (QWebPagePrivate).
        The other way around if QWebPage wants to access WebCore or
        WebCoreSupport related functionality, it will go through
        QWebPageAdapater (as base class). The separation in the direction up
        into the API layer is complete with this patch, no code in WebKit1
        depends on QtWidgets. The separation the other way around, code in the
        API layer not using any WebCore types, is not complete yet.

        Some classes such as QWebSettings, QWebElement or
        DumpRenderTreeSupportQt remain in WebKit1. While they are API layer,
        they do not depend on widget related Qt APIs and they make much more
        use of WebCore internal APIs and therefore are easier to keep in
        WebKit1.

        In the future we plan to place a real shared library boundary between
        WebKit1 and WebKitWidgets, by keeping the WebKit1 static library as
        part of the QtWebKit shared library and by turning the WebKitWidgets
        static library into a shared one.

        [EFL] Refactor GraphicsContext3DEFL.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101291.

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        GraphicsContext3DEfl creates GraphicsContext3DPrivate, which acts as its platform Layer.
        GraphicsContext3DPrivate needs to handle the following cases:
        1) To provide an off-screen buffer for accelerated composition.
        2) Render to a current context.
        3) To render directly to host window. (currently not supported.)

        Before this patch Evas was used to provide us an off-screen context and buffer. GLX was used in
        the other supported case. Evas acts as a glue layer to provide us with appropriate
        GL bindings (OpenGL functions), GL context and drawable (surface/offscreenbuffer).
        However, primitive rendering is handled by TextureMapper and OpenGLShims is used to load the needed GL functions.

        It would be for our advantage to be able to take in to use any optimisations/extensions
        provided by underlying drivers, specific to a platform (e.g. GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer etc.).
        This patch introduces an abstraction layer to make it easy to add support for any GL backend (GLX, EGL etc.)
        and do any platform specific optimizations as needed without complicating GraphicsContext3DPrivate class.
        Two new classes are added with this implementation, GLPlatformContext and GLPlatformSurface.
        GraphicsContext3DPrivate would create and own a GLPlatformContext and GLPlatformSurface.

        GLPlatformContext encapsulates an OpenGL context hiding any platform specific management.
        It uses GL extension ARB_robustness (when available) to detect driver resets.
        It defines a simple interface for things that need to be handled by the context. Support
        for multi-threaded usage and shared context-group would be added later.

        GLPlatformSurface encapsulates an OpenGL drawable hiding any platform specific management.
        It defines a simple interface for things that need to be handled by the surface.
        It creates an off-screen rendering area. Any GLPlatformContext (compatible with the surface)
        can be used to render into this off-screen area.

        This patch also adds GLX implementation. To keep the patch to minimum EGL support would be added in another changeset.

        Due to bug 88834, shadow hosts can be reclaimed before
        corresponding ShadowRoots are.  This breaks an invariant, that is,
        the host is always available for any ShadowRoot.  This change adds
        guards for the possibly broken invariant.

        Since bug 88834 is planned to be fixed shortly, this change
        doesn't aim to fix this problem by make it work correctly, but

        Make it possible for elements with different tag names to share attribute data.
        <http://webkit.org/b/102845>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Allow all elements to share ElementAttributeData with one another. This means that the elements
        in this hypothetical markup will all point to the same attribute data:

            <div class="foo">
                <span class="foo">
                    <hr class="foo"/>
                </span>
            </div>

        This optimization happens at the expense of an old one. We no longer share attribute data
        between elements that have presentation attributes, since they map to different CSS properties
        depending on what tag they're attached to. These are mostly used in ye olde web 1.0 content
        though, and we should prefer optimizing in favor of modern markup. The global cache for
        presentation attribute style in StyledElement.cpp still prevents redundant parsing.

        On the upside, excluding elements with presentation attributes from the data cache means that
        we can move one pointer (m_presentationAttributeStyle) from ImmutableElementAttributeData
        to MutableElementAttributeData.

        Add SkCanvas-equivalent methods to PlatformContextSkia, and refactor direct canvas call
        sites to use these wrappers instead. This reduces the number of canvas() users from 90+

        TiledBackingStore::coverWithTilesIfNeeded() early returns even if the contents
        rect is changed, because changing the contents rect is independent on changing
        both a trajectory vector and the visible rect.

        Currently custom constructors have the following code:

        This is an incremental step for V8Parameter refactoring.

        V8Parameter::prepare() is always called just after V8Parameter's
        constructor. So I want to move the logic of V8Parameter::prepare()
        to V8Parameter's constructor. In preparation for that (i.e. because
        a constructor cannot return any value), this patch changes the return
        type of V8Parameter::prepare() from bool to void.

        "When a transaction can no longer become active, the implementation must attempt to

        requests have been made. Previously, this was done by the back end waiting for events
        from the front end, but the front end can more efficiently make the decision.

        To prevent circular reference leaks we should store the MutationObserver
        callback in a hidden property on the wrapper of the observer.

        This is done by extending the code generator to support a new owner
        argument to ::create() that lets you set the owner of the callback where
        the hidden property should be stored.

        Implement the new stacking layer needed by the Fullscreen API and the new <dialog> element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84796

        Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

        This adds the top layer element stack to Document. The Fullscreen
        specification mandates that we track the ordering of the DOM nodes in
        the top layer, not the renderers. That makes it hard to implement on
        the rendering side only.

        Elements in the top layer get a layer. Layers in the top layer are
        added to the root layer's child list after normal layers and in the
        order of the top layer stack. This way, the top layer appears above
        all other stacking contexts and in the desired order.

        In addition, top layer renderers are added as children of RenderView
        in top layer order. This is to satisfy requirements such as the
        containing block of an element in the top layer is the initial
        containing block. It also allows RenderLayer to know the proper
        stacking order of the layers without going directly from the top layer
        elements to their layers.

        [V8] Simplify V8DOMWindowShell::getEntered
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102156

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        This patch is an incremental step towards merging
        V8DOMWrapper::getCachedWrapper(Node*) with the general case for looking
        up DOM wrappers. In order to merge with the general case, we need to
        get down to calling v8::Context::GetCurrent once, which means we need
        to factor the call to v8::Context::GetEntered out of V8DOMWindowShell.

        As a side-benefit to this change, we can remove some redundant checks
        for isolatedWorldsExist and v8::Context::InContext from callers of
        V8DOMWindowShell::getEntered, including in getCachedWrapper.

        [chromium] Lazy image decoding without cache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102021

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Goal of this change is to make image decoding in ImageFrameGenerator
        completely lazy without caching. Image decoding logic is then removed
        from ImageDecodingStore.

        These methods are removed.
        - ImageDecodingStore::lockPixels
        - ImageDecodingStore::unlockPixels

        Instead image decoding and scaling is done in
        ImageFrameGenerator::decodeAndScale().

        Unit tests are updated:
        DeferredImageDecoderTest::drawIntoSkPicture
        DeferredImageDecoderTest::drawScaledIntoSkPicture

        Changing id, className, or attribute should invalidate distribution
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100738

        Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

        When id, className, or attribute is changed, we might have to invalidate distribution.
        However, we don't want to do useless invalidation. So we consult with the RuleFeatureSet of ElementShadow
        to invalidate distribution only if necessary.

        For the code that className is changed, we can share a lot of code between invalidating distribution and
        invalidating style. So we made checkNeedsStyleInvalidationForClassChange a template method, and share it.

        Since attributeChanged() is a hot method, we don't want to make it slow. So we made one function to determine
        whether we have to invalidate distribution, and make it called only if necessary. Also, we've optimized
        shadowOfParentForDistribution() by making isInsertionPoint() de-virtualed. We consuded NodeFlags (IsInsertionPointFlag)
        for this purpose.

        We've measured how this patch makes changing attribute slow. I've measured each code 3 times.
        DOM/ModifyAttribute.html is a micro benchmark which changes attribute a lot of times. The result of this benchmark
        will be the most affected by this patch. However, it's only 2% performance regression.

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        Media queries call WebCore::Screen::{horizontal,vertical}DPI() to determine

        the device scale factor multiplied by 96 on all ports.

        Apply the resolved viewport rules
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95964

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        This patch implements the CSS Device Adaptation specification. The
        WebKit implementation relies on the already implemented Viewport Meta
        infrastructure to notify the browser of viewport changes.

        The implementation was tests with success on the Qt and EFL ports, but
        basically every port supporting Viewport Meta should be fine.

        The usage of @-webkit-viewport inside media queries (more tests coming
        to map all the corner cases) is currently limited when the media query
        depends on the viewport dimensions itself. Defining the width and height
        based on screen size will fail on ports reporting the screen
        size as the size of the browser window instead of the device screen.

        http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#collections-0

        Unfortunately, HTMLOptionsCollection still has a bug that its named getter and namedItem returns
        a static NodeList instead of a live NodeList (DynamicNodeList) at the moment.

        Also got rid of Document::objects since it's not exposed in IDL or called anywhere.

        [EFL] Refactor GraphicsContext3DEFL.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101291.

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        GraphicsContext3DEfl creates GraphicsContext3DPrivate, which acts as its platform Layer.
        GraphicsContext3DPrivate needs to handle the following cases:
        1) To provide an off-screen buffer for accelerated composition.
        2) Render to a current context.
        3) To render directly to host window. (currently not supported.)

        Before this patch Evas was used to provide us an off-screen context and buffer. GLX was used in
        the other supported case. Evas acts as a glue layer to provide us with appropriate
        GL bindings (OpenGL functions), GL context and drawable (surface/offscreenbuffer).
        However, primitive rendering is handled by TextureMapper and OpenGLShims is used to load the needed GL functions.

        It would be for our advantage to be able to take in to use any optimisations/extensions
        provided by underlying drivers, specific to a platform (e.g. GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer etc.).
        This patch introduces an abstraction layer to make it easy to add support for any GL backend (GLX, EGL etc.)
        and do any platform specific optimizations as needed without complicating GraphicsContext3DPrivate class.
        Two new classes are added with this implementation, GLPlatformContext and GLPlatformSurface.
        GraphicsContext3DPrivate would create and own a GLPlatformContext and GLPlatformSurface.

        GLPlatformContext encapsulates an OpenGL context hiding any platform specific management.
        It uses GL extension ARB_robustness (when available) to detect driver resets.
        It defines a simple interface for things that need to be handled by the context. Support
        for multi-threaded usage and shared context-group would be added later.

        GLPlatformSurface encapsulates an OpenGL drawable hiding any platform specific management.
        It defines a simple interface for things that need to be handled by the surface.
        It creates an off-screen rendering area. Any GLPlatformContext (compatible with the surface)
        can be used to render into this off-screen area.

        This patch also adds GLX implementation. To keep the patch to minimum EGL support would be added in another changeset.

        Element::parseAttribute() should take name & value as separate arguments.
        <http://webkit.org/b/102608>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Update the signature of parseAttribute() to take a QualifiedName/AtomicString combo instead
        of an Attribute. This lets us pass avoid refcount churn in Element::attributeChanged() since
        creating a temporary Attribute is no longer necessary.

        This was surprisingly hot (~1%) on the DOM/CreateNodes performance test.

        A check to see if the event is simulated prior to calculating the offset has existed for a

        Since r82225, we started calculating the offset only when needed, and calculating the offset
        from scratch rather than incrementally adjusting it. Since we recalculate from scratch,
        the isSimulated check is irrelevant, and we should remove it.

        Tests are not possible because all uses of simulated mouse events provide no underlying

        Mapping a rect and a quad by a transform is a common operation because

        The way it was done, is by transforming through mapRect()->mapQuad()->4 times mapPoint().
        Each of those functions tests isIdentityOrTranslation() which has to read the whole matrix
        and perform many comparison.
        Because of that, the simple mapping of a rect was loading and checking the matrix 5 times
        too many.

        This patch just cut the intermediary calls.

        Fix overlay scrollbar painting in compositing layers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102442

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        There were two issues with overlay scrollbar painting in
        compositing layers.
        
        First, we'd only ever call setContainsDirtyOverlayScrollbars()
        on the RenderView's layer, even when encountering an overlay scrollbar
        in some descendant compositing layer. This meant that we'd never
        run the paintOverlayScrollbars() code for those child compositing
        layers, so sometimes scrollbars were missing there.
        
        Even after fixing that, we would fail to render scrollbars that
        were not in the composited RenderLayer itself. This happened because
        we called into RenderLayer::paintOverlayScrollbars(), which called
        paintLayer() with flags that only said to paint the overlay scrollbars
        but not any descendants, so this paint path would not walk child
        RenderLayers.
        
        Also remove the containsScrollableAreaWithOverlayScrollbars() flag on
        ScrollView which is no longer used.

        * platform/ScrollView.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScrollView::ScrollView): Remove containsScrollableAreaWithOverlayScrollbars().
        (WebCore::ScrollView::paint): Remove setting of m_containsScrollableAreaWithOverlayScrollbars.
        * platform/ScrollView.h:

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::paintOverflowControls): Call setContainsDirtyOverlayScrollbars()
        on the compositing ancestor or the root.
        Remove call to setContainsScrollableAreaWithOverlayScrollbars().
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::paintOverlayScrollbars): When painting overlay
        scrollbars, no need to say we have transparency, and no need to use 
        temporary clip rects.
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::paintLayer): The PaintLayerPaintingOverlayScrollbars
        check here was only needed because the compositing entrypoint to painting
        overlay scrollbars went via paintLayer(), which isn't normally used as
        a composited painting entry point. Now that we no longer call that, we
        don't need this special check.
        * rendering/RenderLayerBacking.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderLayerBacking::paintIntoLayer): Jump into overlay scrollbar

        Eliminate ancestor tree walk computing outlineBoundsForRepaint() when updating layer positions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101874

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        RenderLayer::updateLayerPositions() and updateLayerPositionsAfterScroll() spend a
        lot of time in computeRepaintRects(), which does two ancestor tree walks, once
        for clippedOverflowRectForRepaint(), and one for outlineBoundsForRepaint().

        Eliminate the ancestor tree walk in outlineBoundsForRepaint() by maintaining
        a RenderGeometryMap as we traverse the layer tree, and then using it to map
        the outline bounds to the repaint container. Replace the hokey cached offsetFromRoot
        now that the RenderGeometryMap can do a better job.
        
        The clipped overflow rect cannot be mapped simply, so cannot yet make use of
        the geometry map.
        
        Modify the RenderGeometryMap to support mapping to some repaintContainer ancestor.
        Add a RenderObject walk that is necessary to detect flipped writing mode blocks.

        These were found by adding a couple lines of logging-code to

        The PassRefPtr with the underlying event is included as an argument for the mouse

        The fix is for this and related functions to pass the raw pointer.

        A layout test is not possible to put together because the call sites that use simulated

        We generally copy the data received from CFNetwork into our own buffers. But if the
        CFArrayRef has exactly one CFDataRef inside it, then we can just hold on to the CFDataRef
        and access its memory directly and avoid making a copy.

        This also moves the creation of PurgeableBuffer from CachedResource to SharedBuffer.
        SharedBuffer::createPurgeableBuffer() will avoid creating PurgeableBuffer when the
        SharedBuffer is backed by a NSData/CFDataRef and when we want to optimize and directly use
        the memory in the data array.

        [GTK] Move CredentialBackingStore usage from GtkAuthenticationDialog to ResourceHandleSoup
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101840

        Reviewed by Gustavo Noronha Silva.

        Make ResourceHandleSoup aware of per-session CredentialStorage and persistent CredentialStorage.
        Persistent credential storage interaction is moved from GtkAuthenticationDialog, so that it can
        be used whether or not GtkAuthenticationDialog is used or not. We try to properly handle redirects
        in the manner that the CFNet backend does.

        No new tests. There are tests for this behavior, but they cannot be activated until we finish
        plumbing this through to the API layer. Once that patch lands, the tests will be turned on.

        * platform/gtk/GtkAuthenticationDialog.cpp: No longer store credentials into the persistent
        storage manually, instead rely on ResourceHandleSoup. Also, we no longer get proposed credentials
        from the persistent storage here as well. They are pre-loaded by the ResourceHanndle.
        * platform/gtk/GtkAuthenticationDialog.h: Remove callbacks and members associated with saving
        credentials to the persistent credential store.
        * platform/network/ResourceHandle.h:
        (ResourceHandle): Add a method which is used to continue asynchronously after looking for
        proposed credentials in the persistent credential store.
        * platform/network/ResourceHandleInternal.h: Add a member which tracks persistent credentials to be added once we know
        an authentication succeeded.
        * platform/network/gtk/CredentialBackingStore.cpp:
        (CredentialForChallengeAsyncReadyCallbackData): Added this data structure used for asynchronous access
        of stored credentials.
        (WebCore::credentialForChallengeAsyncReadyCallback): Ditto for this callback.
        (WebCore::CredentialBackingStore::credentialForChallenge): Make this method asynchronous.
        * platform/network/gtk/CredentialBackingStore.h:
        (CredentialBackingStore): Update method signatures for for making credentialForChallenge asynchronous.
        * platform/network/soup/AuthenticationChallenge.h:
        (WebCore::AuthenticationChallenge::setProposedCredential): Added a setter so that ResourceHandleSoup
        can set proposed credentials from the persistent credential store.
        * platform/network/soup/ResourceHandleSoup.cpp:
        (WebCore::gotHeadersCallback): For GTK+ save any pending credential in the persistent credential storage
        if the authentication succeeded.
        (WebCore::applyAuthenticationToRequest): Added this method which generically embeds stored credentials
        in the request URI. This is the method that Soup uses to override any soup-stored session credential.
        (WebCore::restartedCallback): Strip credentials for requests that span a security origin. Handle
        authenticating requests from the session store.
        (WebCore::createSoupRequestAndMessageForHandle): Make the local request reference mutable.
        (WebCore::ResourceHandle::start): Remove some code which is now part of applyAuthenticationToRequest.
        Call applyAuthenticationToRequest and clear the user and password members like the CFNet backend does.
        (WebCore::getCredentialFromPersistentStoreCallback): Added this callback for getting persistently stored credentials.
        (WebCore::ResourceHandle::continueDidReceiveAuthenticationChallenge): Split out didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge
        into this asynchronous bit.
        (WebCore::ResourceHandle::didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge): For GTK+ continue handling this situation after
        first looking in the persistent credential store.
        (WebCore::ResourceHandle::receivedCredential): Store session credentials in the session storage, which is
        at the moment a redundant version of the Soup session storage and also prepare any persistent credentials
        for storage later (see gotHeadersCallback).

        [Texmap][CSS Shaders] Make the CustomFilterValidatedProgram maintain the platform compiled program
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102414

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        Added WebCore classes needed for the WebKit2 implementation of Texture Mapper to keep a reference to the 
        platform compiled custom filter. It is just used to maintain the life-time of the objects. WebKit2 injects a
        client in TextureMapperPlatformCompiledProgram and receives a callback when the custom filter program is not
        used to render any layer on the page. 

        Note that CustomFilterValidatedProgram are reused across multiple elements of the same page. Also, the instances
        are reused across frames, so animations should reuse the same pre-validated program. In this case, the mechanism is
        extended and reused in the platform compositor.
        
        No new tests, existing tests for CSS Custom Filters already cover this path.

        progress element or <input type="checkbox">. So changing 'type' might also change :indeterminate state.

        The code was doing this conversion implicitly inside RenderGrid::findChildLogicalPosition.

        on the grid) if we couldn't handle the value. The explicit conversion is needed in order to
        support render areas and add a proper grid model to RenderGrid.

        Web Inspector: Move call stack generation out of bindings.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101331

        Reviewed by Yury Semikhatsky.

        Currently, we generate stack traces for console messages at each call
        site. Bug 100650 has the end goal of moving all stack trace generation
        inside of the Inspector in order to ensure that we never send a console
        message without a stack trace if it's possible to generate one. This
        also ensures that we never generate unused call stacks.

        This patch is the first step in that direction, moving stack trace
        generation out of the Console bindings, and into either Console or
        InspectorConsoleAgent.

        No visible change in behavior should result; this refactoring should
        continue to pass all existing inspector tests.

        A Spin button should release mouse event capturing when a modal dialog opens
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98007

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Description of bug:
        If the mouse left button is pressed on a spin button in
        input[type=number] and a 'change' event handler opens a modal dialog
        such as alert(), a repeating timer doesn't stop and mouse event
        capturing isn't released even though the mouse pointer isn't on the spin
        button.
        A user will see repeating alert dialogs for a document like <input
        type=number value=1 onchange="if (this.value==1) {alert(...);
        this.value=1;}"> by clicking the up button.

        How to solve:
        We should notify modal dialog or popup open to a spin button.
        This patch introduce PopupOpeningObserver. Chrome notifies it when
        any dialogs / popups is opening. SpinButtonElement implements
        PopupOpeningObserver and registers/unregisters itself to/from
        Chrome.

        No new tests. This is a behavior change, but it's very hard to make an
        automated test for timer-related behavior.

        Make OpenTypeVerticalData be ref-counted

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        FontCache::purgeInactiveFontData() uses mark & sweep algorithm to remove unused
        OpenTypeVerticalData objects. It marks only OpenTypeVerticalData which can be reached
        via SimpleFontData in gFontDataCache. However, OpenTypeVerticalData can be referred by
        SimpleFontData which resides in CSSFontFaceSource::m_fontDataTable so the algorithm can
        delete active OpenTypeVerticalData. To avoid deleting active OpenTypeVerticalData, make

        [BlackBerry] Don't assert when notifyAuthReceived is called with a different auth type
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102436

        Reviewed by Rob Buis.

        The server type could change if we contact a site taking HTTP auth, through an HTTP proxy
        taking auth of its own. First we get a 407 from the proxy, and then when get past the
        proxy, we get a 401 from the end site - so notifyAuthReceived gets called again with auth
        type Proxy instead of HTTP.

        The correct thing to do when that happens is skip the "update the auth type in the
        credentials" step, since these are actually new credentials and not just credentials being
        reused for a different auth type on the same server.

        Goal of this change is to keep ImageDecodingStore clean and only do

        In particular these two methods are moved:
        - ImageDecodingStore::createLazyDecodedSkBitmap
        - ImageDecodingStore::resizeLazyDecodedSkBitmap

        No new tests. There is no new code (really). It is just moved from
        ImageDecodingStore to DeferredImageDecoder.

        [chromium] WebGL texImage2D fails with deferred image decoding
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102310

        Reviewed by Kenneth Russell.

        Skia's implementation of GraphicsContext3D::getImageData() uses ImageSource
        to decode an image. When deferred image decoding is enabled this class
        generates an ImageFrame marked as incomplete, which WebGL rejects. This results
        in failing of texImage2D.

        This change uses ImageDecoder directly instead of ImageSource. This skips
        the code path of deferred image decoding. This behavior is correct because
        GraphicsContext3D wants to decode the image differently with alpha not
        premultiplied and color profile applied optionally.

        Added a test to prove this change fixed the bug.

        There's no reason to store info.Holder in a local variable. Calling
        Holder() is essentially free because it's inlined to an offset read.

        I doubt this patch moves the performance needle in any measurable way,
        but it makes the code slightly prettier.

        We use m_numberOfChildrenOnFirstLine when computing baseline alignment.
        This value gets set during flexbox layout. When we remove an absolutely

        Change m_numberOfChildrenOnFirstLine to m_numberOfInFlowChildrenOnFirstLine
        so the value doesn't get stale when we remove absolutely positioned children.
        Also change the loop in firstLineBoxBaseline to bail if we run off the end of

        [TexMap][Cairo] Accelerated compositing debug visuals

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        No new tests, just introducing a debug feature.

        Add a Cairo implementation to complement the patch from bug 90116
        (http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/122275).

        For this feature to be enabled, the environment variable
        WEBKIT_SHOW_COMPOSITING_DEBUG_VISUALS must be set to 1. Once enabled,
        both repaint counters and tile borders will be painted.

        A Cairo-specific drawRepaintCounter() implementation was added to
        TextureMapperGL. A cairo_surface_t is used as scratch buffer to paint
        the counters. It is then uploaded to a BitmapTexture acquired
        from the pool and finally draw by TextureMapper. The actual compositing
        happens inside LayerBackingStore::paintToTextureMapper(). Each
        LayerBackingStoreTile has a repaint counter which gets incremented in
        LayerBackingStore::updateTile().

        since the state is no longer per-Element.

        I've left the presentation attribute cache in there for now, since it still covers the case where
        two elements have the same presentation attributes but different non-presentation attributes.

        Boxes with rounded corners and thin borders are too slow to draw
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101974

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        With the current implementation RenderBox::
        determineBackgroundBleedAvoidance() uses the slow path
        BackgroundBleedUseTransparencyLayer for some very common use cases,
        notably for drawing rectangles with rounded corners that have thin
        borders. This is because the BackgroundBleedShrinkBackground
        strategy requires a border at least two pixels wide on all sides. This
        patch introduce drawing strategy BackgroundBleedBackgroundOverBorder.
        This approach consists in drawing the border first, with an inset inner
        edge (for anti-aliased compositing to work well).  This approach only
        works with opaque solid edges and opaque single-layer backgrounds.
        By using this approach rather than BackgroundBleedUseTransparencyLayer,
        we save two clipPath, one save and one saveLayer on the
        GraphicsContext. This patch gets good coverage from existing layout
        tests. One additional test was added to exercise mitring, thick edges
        and anti-aliasing edge cases under the new painting algorithm.

        [V8] DOM wrapper objects should be collected in minor GC cycles
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98725

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        Previously minor GC cycles cannot collect DOM Nodes. All DOM Nodes
        have to survive two minor GC cycles, be promoted to the old space
        and wait for a heavy major GC cycle.

        This patch enables V8 to collect DOM Nodes in minor GC cycles.
        For real world applications, I confirmed that minor GC cycles
        reclaims a substantial amount of memory (24 MB for Facebook,
        235 MB for Google Calendar) with acceptable overhead (~10 ms
        per minor GC cycle). No performance regression in Dromaeo
        DOM tests.

        When pseudo class is changed, we might have to invalidate distribution. To determine whether we should invalidate
        distribution, we would like to collect RuleFeature from select attributes.

        Don't mark scrolling contents as dirty if RenderLayerBacking is going away
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101947

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When a scrolling contents graphics layer is created or destroyed, the
        associated graphics layer is marked as needing display because some of
        the painted content may have migrated between the primary graphics layer
        and the scrolling layer.

        This causes a problem when the RenderLayerBacking is being destroyed,
        because setNeedsDisplay() needs to check from the compositor whether to
        track repaints or not. If the RenderLayerBacking is being destroyed, the
        value returned by compositor() is garbage and this causes a crash.

        This patch fixes the problem by making RenderLayer::compositor() return a null
        pointer when the renderer no longer has a view.

        Covered by existing layout tests in compositing/overflow/.

        Disable frame loading instead of throwing exceptions on subtree modifications in ChildFrameDisconnector
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102012

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        Previously if you modified the subtree that was being removed from a
        removeChild from inside an unload handler on an <iframe> inside the
        subtree you'd get an exception which is wrong. Instead we just need to
        disable all frame loading there.

        This works because either the subtree will be removed and the frame never
        loading doesn't matter, or some section of the subtree that contains the
        frame will be moved to another part of the document which will cause the
        frame to load when it's inserted there.

        I also added a check for <object> elements. It doesn't seem this is actually
        reachable in the existing code, but I'm not entirely sure since the frame
        loading and object/plugin handling is very confusing.

        A better fix could be to repeatedly walk the subtree until all frames
        were disconnected or some iteration limit was hit and then force all leftover
        subframes to disconnect without firing unload handlers but this is such an
        edge case I don't think the complexity is necessary.

        CSS @charset parsing is too loose, doesn't match other browsers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101527

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        Per <https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19882#attach_1244>,
        IE and FF have changed to be strict about @charset parsing,
        as the CSS 2.1 spec requires.

        Make HTMLLegendElement.form behave according to specification
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101044

        Reviewed by Kent Tamura.

        According to the HTML5 specification (http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#dom-legend-form),
        The form IDL attribute's behavior depends on whether the legend element is in a fieldset element or
        not. If the legend has a fieldset element as its parent, then the form IDL attribute must return the
        same value as the form IDL attribute on that fieldset element. Otherwise, it must return null.

        This patch makes WebKit behaves according to specification (and Firefox). Previously, legend.form was
        not returning null if the element was not inside a fieldset. Also, legend.form did not necessarily
        return the same value as the parent fieldset's form attribute.

        JSEventListener should not access m_jsFunction when its wrapper is gone.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101985.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        - Removed a now invalid assertion. m_wrapper is expected to have a
          valid non-zero value when jsFunction is valid. However, in the case
          of JSLazyEventListener (which extends JSEventListener), m_wrapper is
          initially 0 when m_jsFunction has not been realized yet. When
          JSLazyEventListener::initializeJSFunction() realizes m_jsFunction,
          it will set m_wrapper to an appropriate wrapper object.

          For this reason, JSEventListener::jsFunction() cannot do the null
          check on m_wrapper until after the call to initializeJSFunction.

          This, in turns, means that in the case of the non-lazy
          JSEventListener, initializeJSFunction() will also be called, and
          if the GC has collected the m_wrapper but the JSEventListener has
          not been removed yet, it is possible to see a null m_wrapper while
          m_jsFunction contains a non-zero stale value.

          Hence, this assertion of (m_wrapper || !m_jsFunction) in
          JSEventListener::initializeJSFunction() is not always true and
          should be removed.

        [V8] instantiateV8Object should encapulate the tricky creationContext logic
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102117

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        The logic around creationContext is tricky. Rather than putting the
        logic in the code generator, we can centralize the logic in
        instantiateV8Object.

        This patch shouldn't have any behavior change.

        Clean up the inheritance tree under the MediaControls Class.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88871

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        This patch removes code duplication between the Chromium and Safari
        media controls shadow DOMs.
        This is achieved by pulling common functions that are identical (or
        almost identical) between the different platforms into the base class.
        The derived classes are renamed based on their platform:
        - MediaControlRootElement                to MediaControlsApple.
        - MediaControlRootElementChromium        to MediaControlsChromium.
        - MediaControlRootElementChromiumAndroid to MediaControlsChromiumAndroid.
        MediaControls is now no longer an abstract base class, but its "create"
        function is only implemented in the port-specific header file, so it's
        on purpose incomplete in the MediaControls.cpp file.

        No new tests because this is refactoring work only.

        [CSS Regions] Add Region info for RootLineBoxes and pack the pagination data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101332

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Currently the pagination information for lines is spread between the RootInlineBox and InlineFlowBox classes, consuming memory even though
        the boxes were not the result of an pagination layout. To overcome this, a new struct (LineFragmentationData) is created that wraps all the data,
        including a new member, the containing Region for the line.
        The containing Region is used to detect if a line changed the Region where it resides. This will be helpful especially when implementing region
        styling for layout properties (e.g. the font-size property https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95559 ).
        A line can change the region when it is shifted inside the containing block or if the entire block moves. This means it's better to delegate
        the task of updating the containing Region to the block.

        Tests: No new tests because there is no functional change.

        This is a hard problem to solve on the Mac because there are three pieces of information
             1) The type of button 2) The text on the button 3) The text for the value.
        I think the best compromise is to label this as a file upload button type in the role description, 
        and then expose the file path text as the AXTitle. 
        This will give the more relevant information and should be clear what is happening.

        [V8] More efficient wrapper dispatch
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102082

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        Dispatching a call to V8Whatever::wrap involved a chain
        of calls, each of which checked its wrapper cache.
        This refactor gives calls only 2 choices of functions to call:
        toV8 and toV8Object instead of wrap. wrap has been renamed to
        dispatchWrap and no longer contains cache checks.
        Additionally, classes which require a custom toV8 function
        have had all wrapping and caching calls removed, as they could
        not have been accessed.

        No new tests. Sufficiently covered.

        Add initiator to CachedResourceRequest.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101935

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        Motivation: Chromium needs to know which elements request a
        resource (such as an image or a script) (bug 92761). In addition,
        for exposing resource timing information (bug 84883) we need to
        store the initiator, and this is the first step towards it.

        No new tests: No visible change in behavior.

        Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

        <progress> and <input type="checkbox"> have 'indeterminate' state. When their state is changed, we have to
        invalidate distribution if necessary. To check it, we collect a feature that :invalidate is used in select attributes.

        For <input>, we also have to see 'type' is changed. According to the spec, :indeterminate should match only
        progress element or <input type="checkbox">. So changing 'type' might also change :indeterminate state.

        Exploit ElementAttributeData sharing in Node.cloneNode.
        <http://webkit.org/b/101374>

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        Instead of blindly creating a new ElementAttributeData for Node.cloneNode, let's be clever!
        If the source data is immutable, simply ref it from the new node at virtually no cost.

        If the source data is mutable, convert it to immutable data so it can be shared between both nodes.
        Since the typical use-case for Node.cloneNode is to create-once/clone-many, this saves both time
        and memory in the long run.

        ~8% speed-up on PerformanceTests/DOM/CloneNodes on my MBP.

        Unfortunately, we cannot store the V8DOMWindowShell in V8PerContextData

        Changing id, className, or attribute should invalidate distribution
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100738

        Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

        When id, className, or attribute is changed, we might have to invalidate distribution.
        However, we don't want to do useless invalidation. So we consult with the RuleFeatureSet of ElementShadow,
        and invalidate distribution only if necessary.

        When className is changed, we can share a lot of code between invalidating distribution and invalidating style.
        So we made checkNeedsStyleInvalidationForClassChange a template method, and share it.

        Also we've measured how this patch makes changing attribute slow. By converting checkNeedsStyleInvalidationForClassChange
        to template, actually this improves the performance of changing attribute code. I've measured each code 3 times.

        This patch adds a new member to the GraphicsContextState that tracks 
        whether or not fonts should be subpixel-quantized. We want to default 
        to sibpixel-quantizing, but we'll turn it off if we're scrolling 
        content that cannot be scrolled on the scrolling thread.

        State has a new bool shouldSubpixelQuantizeFonts. It defaults to true 
        since normally we do want to quantize.

        When using the aligned pointer API, we need to make sure to initialize

        error checks than the old API. This patch explicitly initializes the
        enteredIsolatedWorldIndex internal field to zero for main worlds,

        [CSSRegions]Add support for text-shadow in region styling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94472

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Original patch by Andrei Onea.
        Add support for text-shadow in region styling (@-webkit-region rule).
        In addition to the previously supported region styling properties (background-color and color),
        text-shadow requires the computation of an element style in region at layout time.

        This patch adds a new method on RenderRegion - ensureRegionStyleForObject - that
        can be used to retrieve the object style in region (if already cached) or to compute it
        on the spot. When computing the object style in region, we need to compute the style in region
        also for the object ancestor, up to the content nodes.

        This patch also refactors the way styles in region are computed and stored, because
        we can compute the style in region not only at paint time, but also at layout time.

        We preserve RuleFeatureSet collected from select attributes in ShadowDOM.
        When an element attribute is changed, we might have to invalidate content distribution,
        however it's high cost operation. So we would like to check RuleFeatureSet used in
        select attributes to determine we really need to invalidate distribution.

        Like StyleResolver, ElementShadow has several rule features. When nested ShadowDOM is used,
        first we collect features in nested ShadowDOM, and merge it to the parent ShadowDOM.
        For the performance reason, we have a flag to check whether we need to collect features again.

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        This simplifies cursor handling in chromium and unifies it with other
        ports for easier code sharing and testing by moving to the
        USE_LAZY_CURSOR model and eliminating PlatformCursor entirely.

        PlatformCursor adds no value in chromium since the sandboxing model

        Support list of tracks in caption media controls
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101669

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Add some new elements to the media control shadow DOM that display the list of available
        tracks on an audio/video element. The UI is hidden by default everywhere but on Mac,
        where it is given a very basic design. At the moment only the list of available tracks
        are displayed; The followup bug will make the UI active: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101670

        IndexedDB: Combine IDBBackingStore and IDBLevelDBBackingStore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101415

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        Combine abstract interface IDBBackingStore with its only
        implementation, IDBLevelDBBackingStore, to reduce code
        complexity. The legacy structure existed to support a SQLLite
        IDBBackingStore, but it is no longer worth the complexity to
        support this abstraction.

        Changes include:
        1) Merging IDBLevelDBBackingStore into IDBBackingStore.

        2) Merge together IDBBackingStore's inner classes: Cursor,
        Transaction, and ObjectStoreRecordIdentfier with their respective
        subclasses in IDBLevelDBBackingStore.

        3) Simplifying the inner Transaction class to not be refcounted or
        virtualized, to allow it to be a simple concrete member of its
        owner, IDBTransactionBackendImpl.

        No new tests as this is purely a refactor.

        We used to only create m_classNamesForQuirksMode in the constructor or when the class attribute

        IndexedDB: Combine IDBBackingStore and IDBLevelDBBackingStore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101415

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        Combine abstract interface IDBBackingStore with its only
        implementation, IDBLevelDBBackingStore, to reduce code
        complexity. The legacy structure existed to support a SQLLite
        IDBBackingStore, but it is no longer worth the complexity to
        support this abstraction.

        Changes include:
        1) Merging IDBLevelDBBackingStore into IDBBackingStore.

        2) Merge together IDBBackingStore's inner classes: Cursor,
        Transaction, and ObjectStoreRecordIdentfier with their respective
        subclasses in IDBLevelDBBackingStore.

        3) Simplifying the inner Transaction class to not be refcounted or
        virtualized, to allow it to be a simple concrete member of its
        owner, IDBTransactionBackendImpl.

        No new tests as this is purely a refactor.

        Coordinated Graphics: Remove a backing store of GraphicsLayer when the layer is far from the viewport.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101656

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        TiledBackingStore computes cover and keep rects to create, keep or remove tiles
        smartly, but currently TiledBackingStore expects a contents rect is big enough
        to cover the visibleRect. However, when CoordinatedGraphicsLayer uses TBS, it
        is usually wrong expectation.

        We must compute cover and keep rects using the visibleRect, instead of
        the rect intersecting the visibleRect with m_rect, because TBS can be
        used as a backing store of GraphicsLayer and the visible rect usually
        does not intersect with m_rect.
        In the below case, the intersecting rect is an empty.

        table not aligned in center column and seems shrunk because of float:right (table-layout: fixed and width: 100%)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18153

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Preferred logical width is computed incorrectly for fixed layout tables
        with 100% percent width, in standards mode.

        According to our fixed table layout algorithm (CSS2 specification - 17.5.2.1)
        the ultimate width of the table is the greater of the value of the
        'width' property for the table elements and the sum of the column
        widths.

        For our specific scenario we have a fixed layout table with 100% width
        consisting of columns with fixed widths, the sum of which is less than
        the specified width of the table (i.e. 100% of the containing block).
        Even then the applied width is the cummulative of the width of the
        columns.

        This happens because of the quirks mode check added in
        FixedTableLayout::computePreferredLogicalWidths(), which prohibits the
        setting of maxWidth to our fixed layout table with percent width, and
        which perhaps is not required anymore.

        HTMLContentElement should preserve parsed CSSSelectorList
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101543

        Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

        We would like to preserve CSSSelectorList for select attribute of HTMLContentElement.

        Before, we parsed and validated select attribute every time distribution happens. If we preserve the parsed
        CSSSelectorList, we can reduce distribution time.

        This is also a prepration patch for Bug 101180. It also needs the parsed CSSSelectorList. We don't want to
        parse and validate it again.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Fix a bunch of cases of AtomicString with literals:
        -Do not create temporary AtomicString to perform a comparison, that is very wasteful.
        -Use the ConstructFromLiteral constructor whenever it makes sense.
        -Make "x-frame-options" static instead of creating it for each response.
        -Use ASCIILiteral() instead of AtomicString() in EventHandler, the function takes a String,
         not an AtomicString.

        [CSS Exclusions] Polygon with horizontal bottom edges returns incorrect segments
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100874

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Revised the way that computeXIntersections() handles intersections with horizotal polygon edges.
        Deciding if a vertex intersection corresponds to a polygon "edge crossing", i.e. a change from inside
        to outside or outside to inside, now depends on which side of the horizontal line the function's
        y parameter corresponds to. If the y corresponds to the top of the line, then isaMinY the parameter
        is true, and an intersection with a horizontal edge is only considered to be an edge crossing if
        if the inside of the polygon is just below the horizontal edge.  When isMinY is false then the inside
        of the polygon must be just above the horizontal edge.

        Fix getAttributeNode, getAttributeNodeNS and removeAttributeNode to make the Attr
        argument mandatory.

        These used to throw DOMExceptions when an invalid type was passed instead of
        TypeError which is also a spec violation.

        Optimized kerning and ligatures using caching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101269

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        Consider three kinds of text layout, and the value of caching for each:

            (1) 1 layout of 100% unique words: small negative value.

            (2) 1 layout of English prose: medium positive value.

            (3) Many layouts of anything: extra-extra-large positive value.

        Since we can't distinguish betwen these workflows a priori, we use statistical
        sampling. To minimize cost in (1) and maximize benefit in (2) and (3), we treat
        each cache access as a statistical sample, and use the cache in proportion to
        the observed probability of duplicate text measurement.

        Benchmark results:
            plt3: 1% faster

        (WidthCache): Added a class that caches common word widths. This cache
        could cache more things or more cases in future -- but for now it seems
        to cover the common cases.

        (SmallStringKey): Early profiling showed that allocating an AtomicString
        or String measurably added to the cost of the cache, so I added a custom
        string key that can be stored directly inside the table by value --
        empirically answering an age-old question with which Apple WebKit engineers
        seem to be obsessed.

        (WebCore::WidthCache::addSlowCase): There's a little subtlety to the
        sampling policy here. Lots of different approaches are possible, and I
        just picked a simple one that seemed to work based on benchmarking. I'll
        point out some interesting sublteties I'm aware of here:

            (*) Since we start at the min sampling rate, a font used for 20 words
            or fewer never allocates a cache. Anecdotally, some fonts seem to
            be used this way.

            (*) When the sampling rate is x / y, sampling all x words in a row
            seems smart because some words may occur more commonly in relation to
            each other (such as 'each' and 'other'), and repeat workloads will
            lay out the same words in order. Intuitively, these are both reasons
            this policy may ramp up more effectively under load.

            (*) I opted for linear back-off instead of, say, exponential back-off
            because we're not trying to back off to infinity -- just to our min
            sampling rate. Since we don't expect the cache to hit for every word,
            my guess is that exponential back-off would be too aggressive.

            (*) Our "eviction" policy has an IQ of 1. I expect this is sufficient
            because it would be surprising to see a million unique words all used
            in the same document. (I would not like to play a Letterpress game
            against such a document.)

        (WebCore::WidthCache::clear): Needed because a font can change, in which
        case we need to ditch its cache.

        (WebCore::operator==): Needed for hashing.

        This issue has to do with RenderFlexibleBox::computeNextFlexLine. When determing line breaks, the algorithm sees if 1) the total width exceeds lineBreakLength and 2) whether orderedChildren is non-empty.  But then, if the total width exceeds lineBreakLength and there's only absolutely positioned elemments in orderedChildren then the conditions are met and the algorithm mistakenly breaks the line. The solution is to see if orderedChildren collects at least a flex item. If it does, break the line.

        Web Inspector: Add option to disable rulers (Elements panel)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101554

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        A new setting, showMetricsRulers, has been introduced (off by default, so users need to opt in to see the rulers).
        The setting value is passed into InspectorDOMAgent, down to the InspectorOverlayPage, which affects the drawGrid() and
        drawRulers() calls. As a side effect, the issue when the rulers were painted for elements having no renderers has been fixed.

        No new tests, a UI change.

        As for the date format conversion, we have tokenized a format string and
        stored token objects into a vector. We skip token object generation and
        generate a LDML-compliant pattern string during parsing.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        SVG renderer repaint rects are currently expanded only by the shadow of
        the renderer itself; however, the area they need to repaint can be larger
        than that, if their parents also have shadows. We need to take into account
        parent's shadows (respecting transforms, as well).

        clippedOverflowRectForRepaint already recurses upwards through the render tree,
        and ends up with a rect in layout coordinates, so we manually apply the shadow
        at each step (repaintRectInLocalCoordinatesExcludingSVGShadow was added to allow
        us to get the raw repaint rect without the shadow baked-in).

        repaintRectInLocalCoordinates now includes shadows from all parents.

        Also, RenderSVGRoot was clipping repaint rects to the viewport before applying
        shadows, so offscreen elements with on-screen shadows (applied by the root) would not paint the shadows.
        We can just swap the order of these things to correct this.

        filling in the derefObjectFunction for HTMLImageElements (and
        potentially some other types of elements). That manifests today as a
        memory leak in content scripts (which use the derefObjectFunction for
        nodes) and caused a memory leak after bug 101110 because we started
        using the derefObjectFunction in the main world as well.

        SimplifyMarkupCommand takes a disproportionally long time to run when there are many nodes to remove
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101144

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        The bug was caused by attach() happening between each node removal. Since the command was trying
        to remove millions of node in some cases, attach()ing render objects for each node being reinserted
        imposed a huge runtime cost.

        Fixed the bug by using lazy attach when removing nodes and avoiding calls to isContentEditable.
        Also remove all ancestors at once when they are direct child/parent of each other so that we don't
        remove an ancestor and then insert its child back only to remove it again in the next iteration.

        No new tests since it doesn't change the asymptotic performance, and adding a new performance test for
        this specific case is not the worth the increase in the bot cycle time. I'll note that the email
        attached in the original radar bug (<rdar://problem/12179712>) took 100 seconds to open now only takes

        people don't always realize it and check if document()->renderer() is a RenderView.

        This patch cleans up usage of document()->renderer() and document()->renderView() and
        simplifies the code that was written without realizing they were the same thing.

        No new tests, this is just a refactor.

        I've removed the need to get a CustomFilterValidatedProgram from FilterEffectRenderer. It was only
        used to delay the compilation of the shader until it was really needed. Instead, the FilterEffectRenderer
        will directly get the compiled shader in the constructor. The callers that still want to avoid 
        compiling the shader until it is really needed can use the setCompiledProgram to inject the shader
        at a later time, before painting.

        No new tests, the change is covered by the css3/filters/custom/ tests.

        Skip SVG repaint tracking when parent container transforms
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101177

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        This patch skips child repaint rect checks when a parent container is transformed, leading
        to a 75% increase on the RoboHornet SVG benchmark:
            http://www.robohornet.org/#et=svg  (average of 2 runs)
            Before patch: 161.6ms
            After patch: 38.5ms

        SVG transforms are relative to the local container which makes calculating an absolute
        repaint rect expensive because it requires multiplying the local repaint rect by each
        parent container's local transform. See SVGRenderSupport::computeFloatRectForRepaint
        as an example of this calculation.

        This patch takes advantage of SVG's container rules: when a parent container's transform
        changes, all children must be repainted (there is no absolute positioning in SVG).
        SVGRenderSupport::checkForSVGRepaintDuringLayout has been added which checks for whether
        the parent transform changed before doing child repaint checks. A similar optimization is
        used in HTML (see RenderObject::checkForRepaintDuringLayout) where no repaint checking
        is done when the view is fully repainted.

        This code is tested in existing tests.

        AX: Textfields don't get focus when navigated to from 'show all tabs' button
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101369

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When focus leaves a webpage, the webpage does not normally clear its focused node. When focus
        returns (through tab, or mouse click), then focus will be cleared and restored.

        However, when focus is returned through accessibility means, focus is not cleared first, which
        means subsequent focus actions do nothing.

        This fix will check if the focused node is the same as the node being focused, and if so, clear the focus first.

        Making a layout test for this is not possible because it requires setting focus to something in the chrome, and then
        moving focus back to the webpage.

        Crash due to column span under button element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101402

        Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

        When there is a column-spanning child of a RenderButton
        splitBlocks() must split the RenderButton as well as its
        only permitted direct child, the anonymous block referenced
        by m_inner. A crash was occurring because splitBlocks()
        calls addChildIgnoringAnonymousColumnBlocks() to add the
        cloned m_inner to the cloned RenderButton, which meant the
        m_inner for the cloned RenderButton was not being set even

        Re-order variables in BidiRun and LayoutState
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100173

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        The variable re-ordering and use of bitfields for bools has two benefits:
        1) Size reduction. sizeof(BidiRun) goes down from 48 to 40 bytes on 64-bit. This is achieved by removing a bool member variable from BidiRun and packing it together with other bools in the BidiCharacterRun base class.
        2) Security improvement. We have a lot of use-after-free in the RenderObject hierarchy, and the RenderArena class protects us from a lot of trouble by ensuring that objects of arbitrary type cannot be overlayed on top of freed RenderObjects. This change additionally makes sure that non-virtual RenderArena allocated objects do not have member variables which fully overlap the freed vtable pointer. This leaves re-used vtable pointers always pointing to either a valid vtable or an invalid address due to the freelist high-bit poisoning.

        This change is exclusively about size savings; it is performance neutral as you would expect, including on Parser/html5-full-render.html

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The ExclusionPolygon's internal logic, notably getVertexIntersectionVertices(),
        assumes that ExclusionPolygonEdge vertices are stored in clockwise order.
        If this is not true, then we construct the polygon's edges in reverse.

        To determine if the vertices are in clockwise order, we compare the slope
        of the line between the top,left vertex and its previous vertex, with the
        the slope of the line of vertices before and after the top,left vertex.
        If the slope of the latter is greater, then top,left vertex is located
        to its left, and the vertices are clockwise.

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        It was observed in Bug 100057 that calling renderer() repeatedly now that it has a branch
        can be a performance regression. Now that we no longer keep a separate pointer for rare data
        in Document, we can use that space for a pointer to the RenderView making RenderObject::view()
        faster and removing the branch.

        This is a 1% improvement on Parser/html5-full-render.html

        This also cleans up the code because it turns out we don't need to have RenderObject::view() in
        RenderView.h because we can just call Document::renderView() and not do toRenderView. This makes
        it easier to find this method as it exists in the right header file now.

        The main improvements are:
        -Store the full source matrix in the registers d16 to d31. This way we avoid going
         back and forth to memory to use the operands.
         Since the full matrix is in register, we can also directly modify the memory of m_matrix,
         we no longer need the temporary matrix memcopied at the end.
        -Use of LoadMultiple and StoreMultiple to load-store the matrix parameters.
        -Use Multiply-Accumulate instead of VMUL followed by VADD. This half the number of instruction.
        -On regular ARMv7, using a loop to reuse the same code for each row also improve the performance.

        Depending on the hardware, the new code takes 20% to 42% less time than the basic implementation.

        Fix RenderGeometryMap assertion when layers are scrolled during layout
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101292

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        When we set RenderLayer scroll positions as part of layout, we don't want
        to update compositing layers right away. Updating compositing layers
        requires that the entire layer tree has been updated from renderers,
        so that the geometry of all RenderLayers can be trusted. When this state
        was violated, RenderGeometryMap asserts.
        
        Fix by bailing from updateCompositingLayersAfterScroll() if FrameView
        tells us that we're doing layout. A full update of the compositing layers
        will happen later anyway.

        [BlackBerry] Automatically go fullscreen on video play
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101100

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        There is a requirement to have HTML5 video automatically enter
        fullscreen when a video starts playing (PR131774). This change
        implements this feature, with restrictions. The main restriction
        is adherence to WebKit's philosophy of only entering fullscreen
        due to a user gesture. This is important in order to avoid
        pop-up advertisements and other unwanted fullscreen content.
        One consequence of this is that video elements with the autoplay
        attribute will not automatically enter fullscreen.

        Other caveats:
        - This feature applies only to "small screen" devices where
        automatically going fullscreen makes more sense.
        - Fullscreen will only be entered automatically when the
        video is played from the beginning (current time is zero).
        It is assumed that if the user is resuming play from a paused
        state and is not in fullscreen mode, then they exited fullscreen
        mode intentionally.

        removeAttribute('style') not working in certain circumstances

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        After web developers did style.XXXX=YYYY for some element, the inline
        style should be always removable by using "removeAttribute('style')".
        Currently it depends on whether web developers invokes
        getAttribute('style'), setAttribute('style), and so on. E.g. once they
        invoke getAttribute('style'), removeAttribute('style') works. This is
        very confusing behavior.

        TransformOperationInfo's constructor is really slow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101143

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        TransformOperationInfo() was slow for a few reasons:
        -The function used a lot of branches. The basic assumption is that the input
         is incorrect, thus every character is an opportunity to fail.
        -Every branch had to be tested in order. If the name was matching the last if()
         all the previous names had to be tested.
        -Since equalIgnoringCase() was used in every branch, it was forcing the case folding
         every time.
        -When the string is 16bits, the case folding was using ICU, which was incredibly inefficient.

        This can be fixed by either
        1) Compute the lowercase name, then match it to a HashMap.
        2) Write a tree to quickly reduce the number of branch needed.

        The first solution is not viable because 16bits strings case folding
        remains an important bottleneck.

        Instead, the code now splits the names on simple characteristics to
        match any name in a limited number of branches.

        The assumption is the input is correct, so & is used instead of && to
        avoid branches in favor of conditional instructions.

        When FrameView::layout() calls document->updateStyleIfNeeded(), we
        can be in a state where FrameView::needsLayout() is false. However,
        this is a bad time to update compositing layers, because we're about
        to do layout, which will require us to update them again soon anyway,
        and some RenderLayers may not have been sized or positioned yet.
        
        Fix by adding a m_doingPreLayoutStyleUpdate member to FrameView,
        and toggling it around this call to updateStyleIfNeeded().
        Read this state in updateCompositingLayersAfterStyleChange(), which is
        now called unconditionally by recalcStyle(), but returns early
        if this flag is set, or layout is pending.

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        This patch generalizes our support for storing wrappers in DOM objects
        to be usable for more than just nodes. After this patch, any object
        with a ScriptWrappable base class will have its wrapper stored inline
        in the object in the main world.

        To achieve this goal, this patch hides the details of how we map from
        objects to wrappers inside DOMDataStore and then removes the
        IntrusiveDOMWrapperMap class entirely. This approach lets us remove the
        DOMWrapperMap base class and make all of these functions non-virtual.

        Fix layer borders to cleaning appear and disappear on switching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101136

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        GraphicsLayers decided whether to show layer borders based
        on a callback through the GraphicsLayerClient. This made it
        hard to manage state, resulting in a failure to cleanly
        hide layers when toggled off via the preference.
        
        Changed the layer border and repaint counter visibility to be bits
        stored on GraphicsLayer just like other properties, with getters
        and setters. RenderLayerBacking now updates these debug
        indicators when we update other compositing layer properties.
        
        In GraphicsLayerCA, avoid calling updateDebugIndicators() explicitly
        in several places by setting the change flag DebugIndicatorsChanged
        for properties whose values affect the appearance of the debug border.

        Removed the GraphicsLayerClient methods showDebugBorders() and
        showRepaintCounter() which are no longer required.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        Some crashes have been seen under MemoryCache::pruneDeadResourcesToSize. A possible cause is that
        destroyDecodedData() call ends up evicting the resource pointed by 'previous' pointer during iteration
        and deleting the object. This looks in principle possible via stylesheets and SVG images.
        
        Speculative fix, no repro, no obvious way to construct a test.

        * loader/cache/MemoryCache.cpp:
        (WebCore::MemoryCache::pruneDeadResourcesToSize):
        
            Use CachedResourceHandle to protect the 'previous' pointer during iteration. Check if the
            resource has been kicked out from the cache during destroyDecodedData() and stop iterating
            if has (as it may die when CachedResourceHandle releases it).
            The 'current' pointer is not protected as the resource it points to is allowed to die.

        Add the missing keywords and properties for the viewport at-rule.
        Note that we have to mark that we are inside a viewport scope because
        some properties are not validated as they would be inside a style
        rule. As an example, the semantics of CSSPropertyWidth are completely
        different: on a viewport rule, it stands for a shorthand for the
        minimum and maximum width.

        BaseChooserOnlyDateAndTimeInputType should implement DateTimeChooserClient
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101038

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Add DateTimeChooserClient behavior to BaseChooserOnlyDateAndTimeInputType.
        It means that date/time input elements without
        ENABLE_INPUT_MULTIPLE_FIELDS_UI can open date/time choosers by
        DOMActivate event.

        This patch doesn't change behavior yet because Chromimum-Android port

        Fix the collapsing border code to handle mixed directionality at the row level
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101060

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        After bug 87900, we support mixed directionality at the row-group level. For coherency
        - as the underlying code didn't support it - we were artificially ignoring 'direction'
        below the row-group. This change relaxes the restriction and patches the collapsing
        borders code to query the right style and border.

        BaseChooserOnlyDateAndTimeInputType should have BaseClickableWithKeyInputType behavior

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Add BaseClickableWithKeyInputType behavior to
        BaseChooserOnlyDateAndTimeInputType. It means date/time input types
        without ENABLE_INPUT_MULTIPLE_FIELDS_UI receive DOMActivate events by
        pressing space or enter key. They're going to open a date/time chooser
        by DOMActive event.

        Because BaseChooserOnlyDateAndTimeInputType inherits from
        BaseDateAndTimeInputType, it can't inherit
        BaseClickableWithKeyInputType. So, this patch adds static helper
        functions to BaseClickableWithKeyInputType, and
        BaseChooserOnlyDateAndTimeInputType uses them.

        This patch doesn't change behavior yet because Chromimum-Android port

        The problem here is that we use QWebSettings::clearMemoryCaches, a WebKit1 API
        from the injected bundle, which calls initializeWebCoreQt and it sets the platform
        strategies to the one for WebKit1. We should stop using WebKit1 API's from WebKit2
        code. In order to keep the behavior, this patch adds exported helpers to WebCore
        that can be used from DumpRenderTree and WebKitTestRunner. This is the same idea
        as WebCoreTestSupport but these helpers are specific to Qt. Technically we could
        add it to the WebKit1 API for the time being, but my goal was to move in the direction
        of removing the WebKit1 dependency from WebKitTestRunner. We only build the file
        in non production mode.

        Basically covered by all tests.

        * WebCore.pri: We need to link against fontconfig (only in non-production mode) since
        initializeTestFonts uses it.

        is also under that.

        (WebKit::QtTestSupport::initializeTestFonts): I moved this code here as well now that we have to expose
        symbols from WebCore anyway. The advantage is that now we don't have to build it twice and we don't need
        additional files to forward it from the directory of DumpRenderTree for WebKitTestRunner.
        I added a call to FontCace::invalidate in the case when the font set has been changed so that it will do
        the job even if we would stop clearing all caches between tests. Also moved the call to
        QFontDatabase::removeAllApplicationFonts from callers to here.

        Implement HTMLFormElement#requestAutocomplete and associated events
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100557

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        Implements an initial version of the proposal for interactive autocomplete outlined in this email:
        http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-October/037711.html

        The goal of this patch is to allow web authors to call formElement.requestAutocomplete(); after subscribing for
        autocomplete/autocompleteerror events on formElement. If the form's [autocomplete] attribute is "off" an
        error will be dispatched. Otherwise, a request will be issued to the FrameLoaderClient.  At the moment, the
        implementation in Chrome (https://codereview.chromium.org/11270018/) will simply dispatch an error until the
        UI on Chrome's side is built. Both autocomplete and autocompleteerror events will be dispatched asynchronously
        after a small delay to behave consistently in all situations and implementations.

        Currently this is behind the feature flag REQUEST_AUTOCOMPLETE, which is disabled.

        Test: fast/forms/form-request-autocomplete.html

        * dom/EventNames.h:
        (WebCore):

        Added autocomplete and autocompleteerror events. The autocomplete event is dispatched after a user adds more
        information to a form using the future UI. This is not currently dispatched in any implementation (including Chrome)
        but will be in the future. The autocompleteerror event is dispatched when the form has [autocomplete="off"] on the
        node being asked for an interactive autocomplete. The user agent may also dispatch this event if it doesn't implement
        this API but has turned on the feature flag, can't currently show an autocomplete UI (e.g. running headlessly or in
        an HTML notification, security concerns, or any other reason it desires).

        * html/HTMLAttributeNames.in:

        Added onautocomplete and onautocompleteerror attributes so they can be parsed when creating form elements and used
        as event listeners. For example:

          <form onautocomplete="/* when autocomplete succeeds */" autocompleteerror="/* when autocomplete fails */">

        * html/HTMLFormElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLFormElement::HTMLFormElement):
        (WebCore):

        Added m_requestAutocompleteTimer (a timer that's used to dispatch events asynchronously) to the initializer list that
        triggers requestAutocompleteTimerFired when it times out.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormElement::requestAutocomplete):

        Called when HTMLFormElement#requestAutocomplete is called from JS (also see HTMLFormElement.idl) and decides whether
        to dispatch an error and exit early (in the case where autocomplete="off") or pass the request on to the
        FrameLoaderClient.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormElement::finishRequestAutocomplete):

        Called when the request for an interactive autocomplete is finished with either a success or error result. This
        causes an event to queue and fired after a 0 second delay. Events are owned by HTMLFormElement and reference the
        target element (this) until fired.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormElement::requestAutocompleteTimerFired):

        Called when the event timer runs out to pump the queue of current events. Events are released on dispatch.

        (WebCore::HTMLFormElement::parseAttribute):

        Encountering onautocomplete or onautocompleteerror attributes while parsing HTMLFormElements now adds event listeners
        for autocomplete an autocompleteerror events (respectively) to dispatch the value of the attribute as a script.

        * html/HTMLFormElement.h:
        (HTMLFormElement):

        Added various methods and data members as required by the implementation.

        * html/HTMLFormElement.idl:

        Added the method requestAutocomplete and associated DOM event handler attributes (onautocomplete/onautocompleteerror)
        to HTMLFormElement's public DOM API (unprefixed, as per Ian Hickson's advice). All are require the Conditional
        REQUEST_AUTOCOMPLETE to be enabled to be activated.

        * loader/EmptyClients.cpp:

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Move all logic dealing with Attr DOM nodes from ElementAttributeData to Element.
        This makes more sense since an Attr is tied to a single Element, but an ElementAttributeData
        can be shared by any number of Elements at a given time.

        Also updated naming convention from just "Attr" to "Attr node" in the code I was touching.
        "Attr" is way too generic, and has been historically confused with WebCore::Attribute a lot.

        [GTK] Move soup authentication from GtkAuthenticationDialog to WebCore

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Move the actual soup authentication code from the GtkAuthenticationDialog to ResourceHandleSoup.
        This allows a more generic implementation of authentication, for example, one where a WebKit2
        client can completely handle authentication.

        No new tests. This does not change behavior.

        * platform/gtk/GtkAuthenticationDialog.cpp: Remove references to the SoupPasswordManager, which
        is going away in the next release of Gnome. Instead we always assume that the authentication backend has
        support for remembering passwords and pass that information along with the answer to the authentication
        request.

        The rest of the changes to this class can be summarized as:
        1. Getting the information from the AuthenticationChallenge instead of directly from the libsoup
           objects.
        2. Using the AuthenticationClient to accomplish the authentication instead of talking to libsoup

        Replace NodeRareData hash map with a union on m_renderer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100057

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Use a union on Node::m_renderer between NodeRareData* and RenderObject*. This removes
        the overhead of accessing rare data and the memory from the map.

        This is an 8% improvement on Bindings/get-elements-by-tag-name.html which tested
        document.getElementsByTagName and was previously optimized in Bug 90059 for a 5% 
        improvement. As this is better than even the special casing for document that was
        done in that bug, general node list access should see an even greater win.

        This reduces the memory usage on nytimes.com by 250k per Bug 101052 by
        removing the rare data map overhead.

        This is also a 15% improvement on Parser/textarea-parsing.html

        By removing the performance overhead of rareData() this patch addresses the performance
        issues raised in Bugs 73853, 87034 and 89635.

        I ran Parser/html5-full-render.html and there was no performance regression after
        tuning Text::recalcTextStyle and the refactor that was done in r132684.

        No new tests, this is just a refactor.

        Currently, we're collecting metrics regarding usage of the
        'X-WebKit-CSP' and 'X-WebKit-CSP-Report-Only' HTTP headers. We've
        recently added support for the canonical 'Content-Security-Policy'

        those headers explicitly into the metrics, giving insight into uptake
        of the unprefixed header, and into usage of pure reporting vs.

        The problem here is that we use QWebSettings::clearMemoryCaches, a WebKit1 API

        strategies to the one for WebKit1. We should stop using WebKit1 API's from WebKit2
        code. In order to keep the behavior, this patch adds exported helpers to WebCore
        that can be used from DumpRenderTree and WebKitTestRunner. This is the same idea
        as WebCoreTestSupport but these helpers are specific to Qt. Technically we could
        add it to the WebKit1 API for the time being, but my goal was to move in the direction
        of removing the WebKit1 dependency from WebKitTestRunner. We only build the file

        Regression r130057: Improper preferred width calculation when an inline replaced object, wrapped in an inline flow, follows some text.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99442

        Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

        Extra width is displayed after an inline replaced object that follows some
        text (not ending in a whitespace) within an inline-block. This is due to
        the end width (endMin) of the text object being carried forward (via inlineMin)
        and added onto the next line containing the inline replaced object.

        This was caused as a regression to, or rather became apparent post the fix
        http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/130057 which fixed the block's preferred
        width when a renderInline with width contained an inline replaced object.

        implying that there could be more text following, for which the end width
        needs to be carried forward onto the next line.

        In case the following object instead turns out to be an Inline Replaced
        object, we should terminate our previous line and reset this extra width.
        This is now being handled by checking for the shouldBreakLineAfterText
        flag while processing Inline Replaced objects.

        Once set, shouldBreakLineAfterText shall be reset only if we get another
        Text object that ends in a whitespace, signifying the termination of
        that text line. For all other cases, we persist with this flag through
        the block's inline contents.

        Only resolve attribute-derived style once per shared ElementAttributeData.
        <http://webkit.org/b/100990>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Track the serialization of the "style" attribute, and the dirtiness of the presentation attribute style
        on ElementAttributeData instead of in Node flags.

        This allows us to avoid duplicate work for ElementAttributeData that are shared between multiple elements,
        since the state is no longer per-Element.

        I've left the presentation attribute cache in there for now, since it covers two additional cases:

            - Elements with the same attributes in different order.
            - Elements with the same presentation attributes, but with differing non-presentation attributes.

        It's likely that we're not gaining much from it anymore, but that's a topic for another patch.

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        ChromeClient::openDateTimeChooser and Locale::formatDateTime are
        necessary if one of date/time input types is enabled and even if
        ENABLE_INPUT_MULTIPLE_FIELDS_UI is disabled. So they should be wrapped
        with ENABLE(DATE_AND_TIME_INPUT_TYPES).

        The following clases are used only for ChromeClient::openDateTimeChooser.
        They should be wrapped with the same flag.
          - class DateTimeChooser
          - class DateTiemChooserClient

        The following classes/functions are used for
        Locale::formatDateTime. They should be wrapped with the same flag.

        Also, we change the meaning of ENABLE_CALENDAR_PICKER. It meant

        the JS running in worker-context and normal page-context.
        The function "isContentScript" now is virtual because the original invoked functions are useless
        and cause problem in worker-context.
        In function "WebCore::WorkerScriptController::attachDebugger", we invoke "initScriptIfNeeded" to
        ensure the JSGloblalObject exist in the case of attaching Debugger before executing the worker

        Frame scale will add transformation to RenderView, so fixed position doesn't

        [CSS Shaders] Get rid of internal tex coord attribute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94358

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Remove the internal css_a_texCoord attribute that WebKit added to shaders in order to
        sample the element texture by texture coordinate.

        Now, the WebKit-added sampling code can leverage a_texCoord if the author defined it, or
        WebKit can add its own a_texCoord definition to the author's shader.

        Note that vertex attributes are read-only in GLSL. Also, note that we already reject the
        shader if the author did not define a_texCoord with the correct type. Essentially, if
        a_texCoord exists in the author's validated shader, we are guaranteed that it's the correct
        type and that its value is unmodified.

        Ensure that AudioNode deletion is synchronized with a stable state of the rendering graph
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100994

        Reviewed by Kenneth Russell.

        In some rare cases it has been observed that nodes are getting deleted in the main thread
        during an audio rendering quantum where the dirty inputs and outputs have not yet been cleaned
        via calls to handleDirtyAudioSummingJunctions() and handleDirtyAudioNodeOutputs().
        This was possible because nodes marked for deletion with markForDeletion() could be picked
        up in a subsequent call to deleteMarkedNodes() before the render quantum has finished and
        handlePostRenderTasks() has had a chance to reconcile these marked nodes and clean the dirty state.
        The solution is to manage the marked nodes in a separate vector which only gets copied to another
        vector truly eligible for deletion which is synchronized in handlePostRenderTasks().

        <rdar://problem/10161404>
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91912

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        The new value "all" for -webkit-user-select property gives content none-or-all selection option.
        The patch was originally prepared by Alice Cheng but the approach has been changed.
        The idea is to treat these elements like non editable, meaning that we should skip over them entirely
        when moving the cursor and a deletion should delete the element and all its descentants at once.
        The key change is in Node::rendererIsEditable where we now return false if the element style is
        userSelect: all. The other change is in the way we create the selection on mouse click and dragging
        over the element. In both cases we force the selection to extend over the entire element with
        the user-select: all attribute.
        This is currently enabled only for the Mac port.

        The web page view specific metadata should be preserved for web pages loaded from page cache (by using back/forward).
        This requires web page view state to be saved in and restored from the corresponding page cache history item.

        IndexedDB: add methods to support id-based backend APIs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100425

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        First half of refactor involves adding a number of methods that
        are int64_t-based rather than String-based. As a part of this, the
        IDB*Metadata structs and the backend objectStore/index maps all
        use int64_t as keys, rather than String.

        In addition, there were a number of cleanups that came out of the
        refactor:

        - The list of object stores active in a transaction is now
          maintained by the frontend IDBTransaction rather than the backend
          IDBTransactionBackendImpl. This also had a simplifying rippling
          effect through other call signatures.

        - I was able to remove an apparently old FIXME from
          IDBTransactionBackendImpl::objectStore and replace it with an ASSERT.

        - IDBObjectStoreBackendImpl's IndexWriter class got a little
          simpler since the id is now easily available in the
          IDBIndexMetadata.

        - A number of methods got simpler in their int64_t versions,
          specifically dropping a number of ExceptionCodes.

        There is also some glue code
        (getIndexId/getIndexIds/getObjectStoreId) that will go away with
        the 2nd half of this: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100425

        No new tests, no new functionality as this is just a refactor.

        [V8] The DOMWrapperVisitor abstraction is no longer needed

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        This patch removes the DOMWrapperVisitor interface because it is no
        longer needed. As a consequence, DOMWrapperMaps no longer need to
        support enumeration, and we can move more DOM objects to use the faster
        intrusive wrappers.

        There was one remaining user of DOMWrapperVisitor in the
        ScriptProfiler, which I've moved over to enumerating objects directly
        from V8, similar to a function above it in the same file.

        [V8] Unify the V8GCController visitors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100897

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        After this patch, we use a single visitor for all DOM wrappers,
        regardless of type. We also visit all the wrappers in one pass by
        calling v8::V8::VisitHandlesWithClassIds directly rather than via
        visitAllDOMNodes.

        This patch also introduces a wrapper class ID for non-Node DOM objects.
        Previously, only DOM nodes had a class ID.

        Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

        The SVGImage code, when SVG is used in <img> tags, caches the renderer
        at the start of the painting method and re-uses the pointer at the end
        of the method. However, when the page is zoomed the renderer may be
        detached mid-method, thus leaving a stray pointer. The fix is to
        re-fetch the pointer after the zooms.

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        For date/time input types, InputType::convertFromVisibleValue is never
        called. convertFromVisibleValue is called when an inner editable node is
        updated. However input elements don't have such editable nodes if
        ENABLE_INPUT_MULTIPLE_FIELDS_UI is enabled, and a user can't edit the
        inner editable node otherwise because we open date/time pickers when a
        user try to change the field value.

        We had used convertFromVisibleValue for input[type=date] with an old UI.

        [Refactoring] Move initial style setting for ProgressValueElement from attach method to createShadowSubtree method in HTMLProgressElement.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83664

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        The original code updates inline style during attach(). However,
        the attach would be invoked from Element::recalcStyle()'s reattach().
        If updating inline styles during the reattach(), style related flags,
        i.e. childNeedsStyleRecalc, and needsStyleRecalc are cleared after the
        reattach(). So the inline styles are not updated in next
        setNeedsStyleRecalc, because ProgressValueElement has already had
        InlineStyleChange (existingChanegType == InlineStyleChange) and
        markAncestorsWithChildNeedsStyleRecalc is not invoked.

        RenderArena has a memory leak and poor efficiency
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100893

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        1) Avoid memory leak that persists for the Document lifetime by
        increasing recycled size buckets up to 1024. It was previously 400,
        and sizeof(RenderNamedFlowThread) / sizeof(RenderSVGText) both blew this
        quota. An assert was added to prevent this happening again.

        2) Fix the size of the recyled size bucket array on 64-bit. We only
        need 8 byte granularity on 64-bit, but we had 4.

        3) Try and pass power-of-two sizes to the underlying malloc() call, so
        that we're space efficient. We now take Arena metadata into account.

        4) Double the default RenderArena size allocation to 8192 bytes. Even
        for a render of a trivial text file, 4096 bytes is not enough to prevent
        extra calls into the underlying malloc() for more arena pool.

        [V8] Garbage collection should use opaque roots rather than implicit references
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100707

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        This patch replaces visitDOMWrapper with opaqueRootForGC. The
        former used to inform V8 of implicit relationships between wrapper
        objects on a per-wrapper basis. That meant that we needed to know which
        DOMDataStore a given wrapper was in during garbage collection.

        After this patch, we now use object groups rather than implicit
        references to inform V8 of these relationships. That has two benefits:

        1) We no longer need to know which DOMDataStore a wrapper belongs
           because we don't need to find the exact source wrapper for the
           implicit connection.

        2) We can now handle more complicated implicit relationships, for
           example when some of the intervening objects haven't had their
           JavaScript wrappers created yet.

        This patch also unlocks to paths of future development:
        A) Fixing the remaining failures in fast/dom/gc-9.html
        B) Enumerating DOM wrappers entirely from V8 rather than from the
           DOMWrapperMaps (so that we can move more object towards using
           IntrusiveDOMWrapperMaps, which aren't enumerable from WebCore).

        IndexedDB: add methods to support id-based backend APIs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100425

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        First half of refactor involves adding a number of methods that
        are int64_t-based rather than String-based. As a part of this, the
        IDB*Metadata structs and the backend objectStore/index maps all
        use int64_t as keys, rather than String.

        In addition, there were a number of cleanups that came out of the
        refactor:

        - The list of object stores active in a transaction is now
          maintained by the frontend IDBTransaction rather than the backend
          IDBTransactionBackendImpl. This also had a simplifying rippling
          effect through other call signatures.

        - I was able to remove an apparently old FIXME from
          IDBTransactionBackendImpl::objectStore and replace it with an ASSERT.

        - IDBObjectStoreBackendImpl's IndexWriter class got a little
          simpler since the id is now easily available in the
          IDBIndexMetadata.

        - A number of methods got simpler in their int64_t versions,
          specifically dropping a number of ExceptionCodes.

        There is also some glue code
        (getIndexId/getIndexIds/getObjectStoreId) that will go away with
        the 2nd half of this: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100425

        No new tests, no new functionality as this is just a refactor.

        Implement the canonical "Content-Security-Policy" header.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96765

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        The CSP 1.0 specification defines the "Content-Security-Policy" header
        as the canonical mechanism of defining a resource's security policy. Up
        through this patch, we've implemented the functionality behind a prefix
        in order to ensure compatibility with the standard once it's released as
        a recommendation. Both the specification and WebKit's implementation are
        far enough along in that process that it makes sense to support the
        unprefixed header for sites that wish to opt-in to CSP 1.0.

        As discussed on public-webappsec[1], we'll keep the experimental 1.1
        features behind the prefixed header ('X-WebKit-CSP') until that standard
        is far enough along to justify moving them out to the canonical header.

        This patch defines the 'Content-Security-Policy' header for all ports,
        just as the 'X-WebKit-CSP' header is currently supported on all ports.
        Ports that have not opted-in to the CSP_NEXT flag will see exactly the
        same behavior with both headers. Ports that have opted-in will see much
        of CSP 1.1's current definition on the prefixed header, and CSP 1.0 on
        the canonical header.

        The functionality in this change is covered by the changes made to
        existing tests. No expectations changed, only the headers that are sent.

            type based on internal flags, CSPDirectiveList now saves the value

            These features are still locked behind the CSP_NEXT flag, but that
            might not be the case forever.
        (WebCore::CSPDirectiveList::create):
            The static constructor wrapper now passes the type into the real
            constructor, which also now handles setting its internal variables.
        (WebCore::CSPDirectiveList::parse):
            'parse()' is given the header, so it makes sense to store it here as
            well, rather than in the create wrapper.
        (WebCore::CSPDirectiveList::addDirective):
            1.1 directives remain locked behind CSP_NEXT, but now also require
            that 'm_experimental' is set, signaling usage of the prefixed header
            and an implicit opt-in to 1.1.
        * page/ContentSecurityPolicy.h:
            Added two new types to the HeaderTypes enum: PrefixedReportOnly, and

        Change PopupMenu positioning on Windows such that behaviour on multiple monitors matches Windows standards.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100317

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        The existing code determines which screen the popup menu "belongs" to by determining which screen the owning application's hwnd belongs to,
        where ownership is determined by how much of the hwnd is on which screen.
        To match what most Windows applications do, the owning screen should be whichever screen the drop down button belongs to.
        To determine which screen an element belongs to in Windows we need to pass in an hwnd for that element.
        However, since the drop down button is something that WebKit renders there is no hwnd.

        To remedy this issue, we can temporarily move the popup menu's hwnd to match the position and size of the button,
        determine the correct screen, and then eventually move it back to the correct final position after the rest of 
        the calculations have been completed. This is all done in the same function call so no rendering of the popup menu occurs
        between the temporary and final positionings.

        There's not really a good way of testing popup menus except manually, they're separate hwnds created outside of the WebView.

        Cache animationMode() in SVG animations.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99694

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        This patch caches animationMode() which accounted for 25% of the CPU time of a simple
        animation benchmark! This is the 3rd patch for WK99694.

        Background: SVGAnimationElement contains most of the shared animation logic for <animate>,
        <set>, <animateColor>, <animateTransform>, and <animateMotion>. <animateMotion> is the only
        animation element that can depend on other elements in the page. For example:
        <path id="mypath" d="M0 0 L 100 100Z"/> <!-- note, can be animated! -->
        <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" fill="green">
            <animateMotion dur="6s" repeatCount="indefinite">
                <mpath xlink:href="#mypath"/>
            </animateMotion>
        </rect>
        See: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/single-page.html#animate-AnimateMotionElement

        animationMode depends on several properties of an animation element: the set tag, whether
        the animation has a path, and the "values", "to", and "by" attributes. animationMode() was
        a hot function for two reasons:
        1) hasAttribute(SVGNames::valuesAttr) is expensive because we are unable to use
           fastHasAttribute. This is cacheable by simply calculating the animationMode when the
           "values" attribute changes.
        2) In the <animateMotion> case, determining if a path is empty or changed is expensive.
           AnimateMotion can have a path attribute, or it can have <mpath> children that reference
           a (possibly non-existent) <path> element elsewhere in the page. Before this patch we did
           this path lookup on every animation loop in case something changed. After this patch we
           only update AnimateMotion's path when it changes.

        A previous patch, http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/132847, laid the groundwork for tracking
        <path> changes in <mpath>. This patch adds <mpath> to our resource tracking infrastructure
        to track when target <path>s change, instead of looking this up every time.

        This refactoring is covered by existing tests.
        svg/animations/mozilla/animateMotion-mpath-targetChange-1.svg fails after this patch
        because our element dependency tracking has a bug with duplicate ids; see WK99893.

        cloneAndResetNode() is currently pure virtual and implemented only

        does at this time is stuff that a generic ScrollingStateNode could 
        do. We should move this implementation to the base class so that it 
        does not need to be duplicated for future node types.

        This patch also re-names cloneAndResetNode() to cloneAndReset()
        and correspondingly re-names cloneAndResetChildNodes() to 
        cloneAndResetChildren().

        REGRESSION (tile cache layers): bits of tiled layers are missing with certain 3D transforms
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100808
        <rdar://problem/12562541>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When projecting rects down into transformed layers, the projection can fail with severe
        3D rotations if the computed w component in TransformationMatrix::projectPoint() is negative.
        In this case we already clamp, but the fact that we clamped doesn't make it out to
        GraphicsLayerCA::computeVisibleRect() which resulted in incorrect visible rects being
        computed.
        
        Fix by propagating the fact that clamping occurred out of the TransformState functions
        which can clamp. In computeVisibleRect(), simply consider the entire layer bounds
        to be visible if clamping occurred.

        [V8] Garbage collection should use opaque roots rather than implicit references
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100707

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        This patch replaces visitDOMWrapper with opaqueRootForGC. The
        former used to inform V8 of implicit relationships between wrapper
        objects on a per-wrapper basis. That meant that we needed to know which
        DOMDataStore a given wrapper was in during garbage collection.

        After this patch, we now use object groups rather than implicit
        references to inform V8 of these relationships. That has two benefits:

        1) We no longer need to know which DOMDataStore a wrapper belongs
           because we don't need to find the exact source wrapper for the
           implicit connection.

        2) We can now handle more complicated implicit relationships, for
           example when some of the intervening objects haven't had their
           JavaScript wrappers created yet.

        This patch also unlocks to paths of future development:
        A) Fixing the remaining failures in fast/dom/gc-9.html
        B) Enumerating DOM wrappers entirely from V8 rather than from the
           DOMWrapperMaps (so that we can move more object towards using
           IntrusiveDOMWrapperMaps, which aren't enumerable from WebCore).

        Script run from an isolated world should bypass a page's CSP.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97398

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        A page's Content Security Policy currently applies to all resources
        loaded, regardless of their source. That generally makes sense, but
        proves problematic when considering script run from an isolated
        world (Chrome extensions, for instance). These scripts should be allowed
        to inject resources into a page's DOM without eiher being restricted by
        the page's active CSP, or generating violation reports that spam the
        page owner.

        Ideally, the isolated world could define its own Content Security Policy
        which should be applied to resources it loads. For the moment, this
        patch accepts a String that we can parse later on, but only uses it in
        a binary way. If a non-empty policy String is provided, we bypass the
        main world's CSP checks. If an empty String is provided, the main
        world's CSP checks remain active.

        In many classes we have pointer to a client object. These references should be
        reported as weak pointers and the client's memory usage should be reported when
        the client is reached from its instrumented owner where we know exact type of
        the client. Otherwise we would need to add reportMemoryUsage to all client

        Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

        Presumably this is a speedup for other rendering tests as well.  We use firstChild() all over
        the rendering code w/o considering that it makes a virtual function call.
        Originally I just fixed the one callsite which was showing up on the sample to
        use children()->firstChild() directly.  However after further thought, this
        broader solution seemed the better way to go.  The first patch was a 15% win for
        this large table, this broader solution was a 30%!? win.

        The elephant in the room for this table is that we're walking the whole table
        for many nextColumn calls.  But that I will solve in a later bug.

        RoboHornetPro spends ~25% of total test time in WebCore::Region::Shape methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98800

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        This patch brings our total RoboHornetPro time from 8.2 seconds to 5.3 seconds!

        OverlapMap previously used Regions to track Layer bounds rects. 
        Unfortunately unioning a list of Regions is O(N^2)
        where N is the number of Shapes (in this case rects).
        This is because Shapes are immutable, so to union two shapes, we copy
        both Shapes' segment/span vectors into a single new Shape.
        Thus if we union a set of M Regions, each with 1 Shape, we'll end up copying
        the segments of the first Shape N times before we have the final Region/Shape
        and the second shape N-1 times. The sum of 1 to N is (N*(N-1))/2 aka order N^2.
        Fixing the N^2 algorithm covered by https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100814.

        For now we just avoid this O(N^2) by moving away from Region, since OverlapMap
        doesn't need it. We just collect a vector of the layer rects and hit-test that directly.
        Hit-testing the rect list is O(N), just like hit-testing the same information in a Region would be.

        Even better for us is that the OverlapMap is never even used in RoboHornetPro.
        We just collect these rects to end up doing nothing with them. :)

        local(Helvetica) in src descriptor prevent fallback

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        FontCache::getCachedFontData() has a mechanism that aliases a few pairs
        of font family names, so that if the family name specified in the font-family
        property is not available on the system, but the its alias is available,
        it will be used instead. This is appropriate for the font-family property,
        but not for font family names specified in the local() function of the src
        descriptor in a @font-face rule.

        This patch disables the mechanism while checking src descriptor of @font-face.

        No new tests. It's difficult to test the change because 'Helvetica' can
        be mapped any other font. For example, chromium DRT uses FontConfig to
        map Helvetica to Times New Roman. Other ports may map Helvetica to other
        fonts. We can't define the expected result.

        white-space: nowrap inline element beside a floated element wraps incorrectly without trailing textnode/newline
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29648

        Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

        A no-wrap child on a line inside an autowrap container should move to the next line if a float doesn't allow
        it to fit. This will happen if there is trailing space after the no-wrap child but not if it's the last renderer
        on the line. This is because nextLineBreak() is only interested in the white-space style of the current renderer 
        and the renderer's next sibling (if there is one) when deciding whether it needs to fit below any floats that
        push it beyond the edge of the container. There isn't any situation in which a no-wrap child shouldn't move 
        below a float on an auto-wrap line though, so this check always needs to respect the container's white-space style too.

        such a range could not be constructed if the paragraph range was contained in a shadow DOM,
        since a range must have both its endpoints within the same shadow tree (or not in a shadow

        Web Inspector: Associate console messages with the requests that caused them.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99941

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        The inspector currently supports the concept of a request's "initiator"
        in order to add context to console messages that are generated in
        response to a specific request. The initiator is used as the message's
        anchor link iff a requestID is present, and no stack trace is present.

        Currently, this functionality is only exposed to three specific
        callsites: 'InspectorConsoleAgent::didFinishXHRLoading',
        'InspectorConsoleAgent::didReceiveResponse', and
        'InspectorConsoleAgent::didFailLoading'. This patch adds a generic
        mechanism to associate requests with console messages by passing the
        request's identifier through 'ScriptExecutionContext::addConsoleMessage'
        or 'Console::addMessage' when relevant.

        This patch should have no visible changes. It just installs some new
        piping, and adjusts the three methods mentioned above to use it.
        Existing tests shouldn't break.

        * inspector/ConsoleMessage.cpp:
        (WebCore::ConsoleMessage::ConsoleMessage):

        * inspector/ConsoleMessage.h:
        (ConsoleMessage):

        (WebCore::IdentifiersFactory::requestId):

        AX: Support embedded SVG objects in AX tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97571

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        This patch allows an SVG image from another resource to be hooked into the AX
        hierarchy. This is done by creating an AX wrapper for the root SVG that holds onto
        its native parent image. The SVGChromeClient is then used to connect to this SVG resource.

        [CSS Shaders] Reject vertex shaders with custom attributes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98973

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Improved CSS Custom Filters shader validation. With this patch:
        (1) Shaders with custom attributes do not execute (e.g. attribute float my_attribute;).
        (2) Shaders with a_triangleCoord defined do not execute with an attached mesh.

        Most of the changes are from renaming CustomFilterOperation::MeshType to
        CustomFilterMeshType, and moving the enumeration to CustomFilterConstants.h. This avoids
        pulling in CustomFilterOperation for classes that only care about the mesh type.

        Note that in CSS Custom Filters, the a_triangleCoord attribute is only available in detached
        meshes. In detached meshes, no vertices are shared between triangles. Thus, each vertex
        belongs to a specific triangle, which a_triangleCoord identifies. In attached meshes,
        vertices can belong to many triangles, which a_triangleCoord cannot identify because it's
        only a vec3.

        Tests:
        Add two new checks to the test file:
            css3/filters/custom/invalid-custom-filter-attribute-types.html
        Add two new shaders:

        Let SVGElements have pending resources.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99694

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Our SVG pending resource tracking is used for handling dynamic id changes. For example,
        if an SVG element references an id that is not yet in the document (or has been removed),
        the SVG element will be 'pending' an id. When styled elements are inserted into
        the document, buildPendingResourcesIfNeeded() is called to force any pending elements
        to resolve their dependencies. Only SVGStyledElement targets can be referenced using
        this infrastructure, and that is not changed with this patch.

        Previously, only SVGStyledElements could have pending resources. Some examples of where
        this is violated are SVGAnimateElement and SVGMPathElement which are not a styled elements
        but which can have pending references (they can reference styled elements and
        paths, respectively). This patch changes the pending resource handling to allow
        any SVGElement to have pending resources.

        This patch is only a refactoring of code in preparation for WK99694 and does not
        affect existing functionality or tests.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100623

        Reviewed by Noam Rosenthal.

        Currently, GraphicsLayerAnimation chooses a timing function in the wrong
        way. Other GraphicsLayers choose a timing function in the similar way to
        GraphicsLayerCA::timingFunctionForAnimationValue(). The way consists of
        the following steps.
        1. Try to query the timing function of the current keyframe animation value.
        2. If the timing function of #1 is null, try to query the timing function of Animation.
        3. If the timing function of #2 is null, return CubicBezierTimingFunction::defaultTimingFunction().

        This patch makes GraphicsLayerAnimation choose a timing function in the same way
        to other implementations.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100630

        This is not a complete fix.  Our rendering of this large tables still takes 7.8 seconds
        on my retina MBP (down from 14.3s before this change).
        It's very expensive to walk the DOM each time we call RenderTable::colElement
        so this caches the RenderTableCol* in a vector for easier walking.
        We invalidate the cache any time a RenderTableCol is added or removed from the
        rendering sub-tree to avoid holding a bad pointer.

        The shadow element is not reprojected to a nested ShadowRoot.

        We support shadow reprojection; elements distributed to <shadow> element can be reprojected to <content> now.

        First, we have a distribution vector for each InsertionPoint, even if InsertionPoint is a shadow insertion point.
        And we update a node-distribution map. Basically We're creating a map from node to InsertionPoint in ElementShadow.
        If a node can be distributed to several InsertionPoint (e.g. in case reprojection happens),
        the InsertionPoint in older ShadowDOM is chosen.

        [MathML] Improve some addChild methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98791

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        MathML addChild methods need to handle any anonymous renderers correctly. Actually, most MathML elements have a fixed
        number of children, so conformant javascript won't be doing arbitrary addChild and removeChild calls. However, we don't
        want any assertions to fail, and we do want addChild to work correctly when beforeChild == 0, to build up the original
        renderer, and then replaceChild at least should work correctly after that. We therefore clean up these routines before
        giving them to the chromium fuzzers.
        
        It's best to build the anonymous wrappers just once initially if possible, so empty wrappers aren't left in the render
        tree after later removeChild calls.

        Test: mathml/presentation/dynamic.html added for mfrac and msqrt. There are already tests for dynamically changing
        msub/sup elements, in mathml/presentation/m*-changed.xhtml.

            - The two wrappers are built initially. Also, the old RenderMathMLBlock::addChild(row, beforeChild); doesn't really

              added initially, and then later replaced with replaceChild. It's not clear whether e.g. a plain removeChild of a
              numerator should move the remaining child from the denominator to the numerator or not, so we ignore that for now.

        NaN values can cause ElementTimeControl to go back in time!
        If a value of NaN is passed to ElementTimeControl::beginElementAt(offset),

        Implement AudioBufferSourceNode .loopStart and .loopEnd attributes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100170

        Reviewed by Kenneth Russell.

        AudioBufferSourceNode currently only supports looping of an entire AudioBuffer.
        Sample-based synthesis is a very common technique which requires "internal" loop-points.
        For example, the first part of the sample data might represent the attack portion of
        a synthesized instrument, which then enters a loop portion.

        Prevent NaN offset values in ElementTimeControl.

        NaN values can cause ElementTimeControl to go back in time!
        If a value of NaN is passed to ElementTimeControl::beginElementAt(offset),
        subsequent sorting will cause an assert in SVGSMILElement::findInstanceTime
        because NaN values are not properly sorted. NaN SMILTime values
        should not be allowed at all, so this patch adds a check for them in
        ElementTimeControl's setters.

        This patch also adds preventative asserts to catch if SMILTime is ever
        initialized with NaN, or if addEndTime/addBeginTime are ever called
        with NaN values.

        AX: Notification should be sent when accessibilityIsIgnored changes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99547

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Adds a new flag in AccessibilityObject that keeps track of the most recent
        value of accessibilityIsIgnored(). After certain events such as an ARIA
        attribute change or content change, checks the new value of
        accessibilityIsIgnored() and posts a "children changed" notification on the
        parent node if it changed, making sure the parent recomputes its vector of
        (unignored) children.

        Also moves handling of attribute changes to AXObjectCache, and sends
        notifications for some attribute changes that were previously silent. On
        Chromium, all changes to an accessibility object's attributes should
        result in some notification.

        Some tests would have broken because an AccessibilityScrollView was created
        and holding a reference to a ScrollView for an iframe after it was deleted,
        so this change switches AccessibilityScrollView to hold a weak reference
        to ScrollView instead.

        Use Node custom callbacks to support the non-renderer style caching for option

        setRenderStyle only existed to support HTMLOptionElement and HTMLOptGroupElement
        so they could store their RenderStyle even though they have no renderer. This
        means all style setting went through the virtual call to setRenderStyle, and it
        also hid the if statement protecting against null renderers meaning we end up
        checking if the renderer is null repeatedly in recalcStyle. This refactor cleans
        up recalcStyle to be more clear about what's going on.

        [Shadow]: removing styles in shadow dom subtree causes crash.

        To quickly check whether shadow roots or elements have any scoped
        styles or not, elements have hasStyleScoped flag. If elements have
        any scoped styles, the styles are direct children of the element.
        The original code just sees how many chilren are scoped style or not.
        However styles in shadow dom subtree are registered with the shadow
        root but are not always direct children of shadow roots. So to check
        whether shadow roots have any scoped styles, modified to count
        number of styles registered with the shadow root.

        compute the region override logical content height if the region break fits inside an auto logical height region.
        A region break inside an auto logical height region determines the region override logical content height, taking
        min/max height into account.

        Generate less repaint calls during subtree detaching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99741

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Following bug 98336, detach is now a subtree top-down operation. Because we
        track visual overflow from our children during layout for most cases, we can
        generate a repaint only on the subtree root.

        On http://dglazkov.github.com/performance-tests/redraw.html, this ups the FPS to
        26 fps from 22 fps on my MBP (+ 15%). On PerformanceTests/layout/subtree-detach.html,
        it decreases the time by 35%. This is due to being the best case and we now generate
        only one repaint per detach phase.

        Covered by existing pixels tests (including but not limited to repaint ones).

        * rendering/RenderObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderObject::destroyAndCleanupAnonymousWrappers):
        Changed the function not to be recursive anymore to generate one painting for
        our root only. Added a FIXME about using our RenderLayer for repainting to avoid
        the cost of computing our absolute repaint rectangle.

        * rendering/RenderObjectChildList.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderObjectChildList::removeChildNode):
        Removed the logic for repainting in the general case. However we still force a repaint
        if we have a RenderLayer as we don't track their overflow in some cases (e.g. positioned
        objects). This check is conservative and could be narrowed down (e.g overflow RenderLayers
        are properly accounted for in our clipppedOverflowRectForRepaint).

        local(Helvetica) in src descriptor prevent fallback
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100446

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        FontCache::getCachedFontData() has a mechanism that aliases a few pairs
        of font family names, so that if the family name specified in the font-family
        property is not available on the system, but the its alias is available,
        it will be used instead. This is appropriate for the font-family property,
        but not for font family names specified in the local() function of the src
        descriptor in a @font-face rule.

        This patch disables the mechanism while checking src descriptor of @font-face.

        No new tests. It's difficult to test the change because 'Helvetica' can
        be mapped any other font. For example, chromium DRT uses FontConfig to
        map Helvetica to Times New Roman. Other ports may map Helvetica to other
        fonts. We can't define the expected result.

        Tiled layers are missing content on zooming
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100422

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Tiled layers using TileCaches were missing content after
        zooming. TileCache was confused in the presence of scaling;
        it unapplies the scale on the layer above the tiles (so the tiles
        live in screen space), and computed the tile coverage rect
        in these tile coordinates. This worked for the page tile cache,
        because its visibleRect was sent in pre-scaled. However, for
        tiled layer TileCaches this was wrong.
        
        Fix by scaling the tile coverage rect by m_scale before
        using it to compute which tiles to throw away and bring in.
        
        To fix the problem of the visibleRect being pre-scaled
        for the page tile cache, remove the setting of the visibleRect
        in RenderLayerCompositor::frameViewDidScroll(), and rely on 
        GraphicsLayerCA::updateVisibleRect() which computes the
        visible rect in the correct, layer coordinates.

        Avoid unnecessary style recalcs on id attribute mutation.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100395

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        There is no need to invalidate element style on id attribute change if neither the old nor the new id were 
        mentioned in any stylesheet. This is similar to the optimization we already have for class attributes.
        
        Recalculating element style is expensive. It seems id attribute mutation is often used in scripts for purposes other than styling.

        AX: Notification should be sent when accessibilityIsIgnored changes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99547

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Adds a new flag in AccessibilityObject that keeps track of the most recent
        value of accessibilityIsIgnored(). After certain events such as an ARIA
        attribute change or content change, checks the new value of
        accessibilityIsIgnored() and posts a "children changed" notification on the
        parent node if it changed, making sure the parent recomputes its vector of
        (unignored) children.

        Also moves handling of attribute changes to AXObjectCache, and sends
        notifications for some attribute changes that were previously silent. On
        Chromium, all changes to an accessibility object's attributes should
        result in some notification.

        Some tests would have broken because an AccessibilityScrollView was created
        and holding a reference to a ScrollView for an iframe after it was deleted,
        so this change switches AccessibilityScrollView to hold a weak reference
        to ScrollView instead.

        [V8] AbstractWeakReferenceMap is unnecessarily general and complex
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100175

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        Before this patch, AbstractWeakReferenceMap served two masters:

        1) DOM wrappers
        2) NPV8 function templates

        These two uses cases pushed AbstractWeakReferenceMap to be more general
        and complex that needed. This patch separates these two uses cases into
        two separate classes. V8NPTemplateMap is all of 40 lines of code. It's
        not worth complicating the DOM wrapper code path to share that tiny
        amount of code.

        The other thing this patch does is store a pointer to the DOM wrapper
        map as the weak callback context object. That means we no longer need
        to search through all the wrapper maps in order to find the map that
        contains this particular DOM wrapper.

        Currently a long-press gesture is used to dispatch a context menu (for platforms

        Fix CALayer hiearchy when combining tiling with preserve-3d
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100205

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        When an element has "transform-style: preserve-3d", its GraphicsLayerCA has a
        m_structuralLayer which is a CATransformLayer. The primary CALayer which contains rendered
        content becomes a sublayer of the CATransformLayer. If the element has backface-visibility:hidden,
        it is the primary layer that is set to be single-sided.
        
        In r131940 we started to use TileCaches in place of CATiledLayer. TileCaches work via
        "customSublayers" returned from the PlatformCALayer, where the custom sublayer is 
        the tile cache container layer. However, the custom sublayers were being added as
        children of the structural (CATransformLayer) layer, not of the primary (CALayer) layer,
        thus they were not affected by the doubleSided property.
        
        This change cleans up the confusing code in GraphicsLayerCA::updateSublayerList()
        by maintaining two vectors of PlatformCALayers, one for sublayers of the structural
        layer, and one for sublayers of the primary layer. It adds custom sublayers to
        the latter list, so now the tile cache container layer becomes a sublayer of
        the primary layer, so is affected by that layer's doubleSided property.

        switched. They now match the description in the exif spec at
        http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF page 18, and the notes at
        http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/EXIF.html and
        the picture at http://www.80sidea.com/archives/2316.

        They showed up correctly in Safari because the orientation transform
        was done after flipping Y. Let the flipping happen later. I verified
        that flipping transformation order and fixing the exif enum cancelled
        each other out, so this has no effect on the apple port.

        Not hooked up yet, so no observable difference.

        [Chromium] SVG repaint issues
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99874

        Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

        RenderSVGRoot::paintReplaced() converts the container offsets to a relative transform,
        but in doing so it ends up accumulating subpixel rounding deltas twice: first for 
        adjustedPaintOffset and second in localToParentTransform(). If coordinates are on
        half-pixel boundaries, the 2x rounding delta yields a full pixel drift and we end up
        painting at the wrong location.

        This can be avoided by using localToBorderBoxTransform() directly, which (unlike
        localToParentTransform()) doesn't perform rounding.

        No new tests: existing pixel results cover this change after rebaseline.

            The GraphicsSurface implementation on Windows relies on the

            For Qt this requirements are implicitly satisfied, when Qt is built
            on Windows and QT_CONFIG contains OpenGLES2.
            The GraphicsSurface then renders a given texture onto an offscreen
            pixel buffer surface, queries the surface pointer using the
            EGL_ANGLE_query_surface_pointer extension, and transmits the received
            surface pointer (share handle) over IPC.
            On the UIProcess side, the surface pointer can then be resolved

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Before this patch, the element with ::-webkit-datetime-edit had

        ignores baselines of each of inner fields. We need to change it to
        -webkit-align-items:baseline, or stop using -webkit-flex.

        However -webkit-align-items:baseline doesn't work because a spin
        button element in the element doesn't have the baseline. If we
        specified -webkit-align-items:baseline, the spin button would
        shift up.

        So, we change the element structure for multiple fields input
        elements. Before this patch, the structure was:

             |   - ::-webkit-inne-spin-button
              - ::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator

        After the patch, the structure will be:

        input
          |
           - ::-webkit-date-and-time-container (flexible box)

             |
             |- ::-webkit-inne-spin-button
              - ::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator

        Because the spin button owner is date-and-time-container, we don't
        need to make the datetime-edit element a flex container.

        Also, we had rounding error by subpixel layout. To avoid it, we
        stop using fractional paddings.

        In order to implement this, we need to change the SpinButtonOwner
        interface provider from DateTimeEditElement to
        BaseMultipleFieldsDateAndTimeInputType.

        [CSS Shaders] Changing the blend mode in CSS doesn't update the custom filter rendering
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99887

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Before this patch, WebKit would not recompute an element's style when just its custom filter
        blend mode changed.

        For example, suppose an element initially has the style:
        -webkit-filter: custom(none mix(url(shader.fs) multiply source-atop));

        Then, we change the blend mode from "multiply" to "normal":
        -webkit-filter: custom(none mix(url(shader.fs) normal source-atop));

        WebKit now detects this change and recomputes the style.

        CustomFilterProgram now has an equals operator that considers the program type and the mix
        settings. The mix settings contain the blend mode.

        [MathML] Symbol font uses greek letters for roman ones on linux and Windows
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99921

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        For parts of stretched parentheses and brackets, mathml.css currently uses the Symbol font,
        which on linux and Windows has greek letters at roman code points. To fix this, we switch
        to the STIXSizeOneSym font when available. However, this can cause vertical gaps between
        glyph parts, because of hard-coded constants in RenderMathMLOperator.cpp. We eliminate all
        these constants. We also shift glyphs upward by 1px and truncate them to avoid the gaps.

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        We recently landed a patch to trim the middle out of long URLs in
        console messages in order to improve readability. That patch didn't
        effect 'data:' URLs, as they didn't match the regex in the linkifier.
        This patch ensures that 'data:' URLs are properly trimmed down to
        size.

        This problem came to light while resolving a different, smaller issue:
        'image/jpg' wasn't whitelisted as an image MIME type. That trivial fix
        is included in this patch.

        Always parse pasted fragments as HTML even on XHTML pages
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99880

        Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

        When pasting HTML into a page, using the XML parser is unlikely
        to work correctly, as the contents of the clipboard are unlikely
        to be properly-formed XHTML. Thus, for the pasting case, it's always
        better to use HTML parsing, which will properly parse either HTML
        (which is what's usually in the clipboard) or XHTML (which is
        sometimes there as well).

        The Mac port previously worked around this problem by falling back to plain text
        when parsing failed, but switching to HTML seems like a clear improvement.

        This also fixes a crash in Chromium (see http://webkit.org/b/99607
        and http://crbug.com/136218); it erroneously assumed that createFragmentFromMarkup()
        would never return null. This patch makes that true.

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        In working to remove the integer cache, I added some faster APIs for
        creating v8::Integers. These APIs are faster than the old APIs, but not
        quite fast enough to replace the integer cache. We should still use
        them when we miss the integer cache.

        I've also included a small refactoring to V8PerIsolateData to make it
        clearer when we're calling v8::Isolate::GetCurrent().

        RenderTableCol::computePreferredLogicalWidths and RenderTableCol::layout should never be called

        RenderTableCol's computePreferredLogicalWidths and layout's only purpose were to clear the preferred logical
        widths dirty / layout flag so that we would properly propagate the information to our containing table. This
        led to clunky code where the table layout code had to forcefully call RenderTableCol::computePreferredLogicalWidths

        REGRESSION(r131104): Heap-use-after-free in WebCore::Element::attributeChanged
        <http://webkit.org/b/99937>

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        Setting the "type" attribute on an HTMLInputElement that has no "value" attribute set will cause the
        input type changing mechanism to write a value attribute onto the element. This happens in
        HTMLInputElement::updateType(), below parseAttribute().

        It's done via Element::setAttribute(), so we end up re-entering Element::setAttributeInternal()
        where the 'existingAttribute' pointer may now be invalid if adding the "value" attribute caused
        a reallocation in the ElementAttributeData's underlying Vector<Attribute>.

        To make it harder to introduce this kind of bug in the future, I changed almost all functions that take
        a "const Attribute&" to take a QualifiedName/AtomicString couple instead (the idea being that the 
        fewer references into the attribute store we have, the better.)

        Modify LayoutState ASSERTS to support SATURATED_LAYOUT_ARITHMETIC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98692

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        We currently overflow/wrap when computing the delta in
        RenderBlock::setLogicalTopForChild in cases where we have an
        element with a width or height exceeding maxLayoutUnit. When
        the delta is later added back in RenderBlock::layoutBlockChild
        the number wraps again getting us back to the correct value.

        With SATURATED_LAYOUT_ARITHMETIC enabled the values no longer
        wraps, which seems like the correct thing to do however this
        causes the compare to fail for obvious reasons. By accounting
        for this we can keep the asserts (which have proven very
        helpful) even when SATURATED_LAYOUT_ARITHMETIC is turned on.

        No new tests, covered by existing tests.

        [Qt] Fix "ASSERTION FAILED: !document->inPageCache()" when loading a page
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98514

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        The problem is that we call setFixedVisibleContentRect, which triggers
        a layout, after the document has been put in the page cache and before
        the load has been actually committed.

        This applies the same trick as with setFixedLayoutSize by passing the rect
        in Frame::createView and calling setFixedVisibleContentRect before the
        new FrameView gets attached to the Frame/Document to prevent the layout.

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        Cache the hash on QualifiedNameImpl after the first time it's computed.
        This grows QualifiedNameImpl by 4 bytes on 32-bit (no change on 64-bit due to base class padding)
        which I believe is fine, since QualifiedName is a shared object.

        Add a global nullQName() function that returns a QualifiedName(nullAtom, nullAtom, nullAtom)
        and use this to implement HashTraits<QualifiedName>::emptyValue(). The old implementation would
        create a new QualifiedName(nullAtom, nullAtom, nullAtom) each time, which had to be hashed,
        added to  the global QualifiedName cache, etc.

        Finally, don't have SVGAttributeHashTranslator create a temporary QualifiedName just to compute
        the hash of a (namespace, prefix, localName) tuple, use QualifiedNameComponents and hashComponents()
        directly instead.

        Fix a hang when combining tile cache layers with preserve-3d or reflections
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99890
        <rdar://problem/12539560>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The new tile cache code added an updateSublayers() call when switching to/from
        tiled layers. This confused later sublayer rebuilding, causing us to attempt to
        add a layer as a child of itself, causing a hang in CA.
        
        Fix by removing all the explicit calls to updateFoo when updating the structural
        layer and switching to/from tiled layers. Instead, we set dirty flags, and rely
        on the fact that these flag-dirtying functions get called before the later functions
        that process those dirty flags. This is assured by some reordering of the update
        function calls.
        
        A final wrinkle is that ensureStructuralLayer() can change the layer that our
        parent GraphicsLayer put in its sublayer list. Rather than diddle with that sublayer
        list directly like we used to, just call noteSublayersChanged() on the parent, and have
        commitLayerChangesAfterSublayers() check the ChildrenChanged and do a second update
        of sublayers if necessary (we clear the flag in commitLayerChangesBeforeSublayers(), so
        only do this work if a sublayer requested it).

            if the symbol name ends in "[0]", since ANGLE appends this suffix to array symbol
            names.
            If the symbol is an array, we strip off the "[0]" and add a symbol with just the base
            name. We set the isArray flag on the symbol, so we don't lose the information that it is
            an array.
            Then, we create symbols for each array element like before. However, instead of
            replacing the "0" in array[0]" with each index, we take the base name "array" and

        [chromium] Implement deferred image decoding
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94240

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Objectives:

        To record image decoding operations during painting and to defer
        decoding operations until rasterization.

        Rationale:

        This is a key feature that enables impl-side painting which requires
        fast recording of drawing operations. The existing decode-on-draw
        restricts that recording has to block on expensive decoding operations.
        This change allows recording of image decoding operations during paint
        time.

        Design:

        Image decoding happens when a BitmapImage is drawn into a
        GraphicsContext. When per-tile painting is enabled GraphicsContext
        is backed by SkCanvas in recording mode. This SkCanvas records drawing
        and image decoding operations to minimize recording time.

        An image decoding operation is recorded as a SkPixelRef object
        implemented by LazyDecodingPixelRef. This object references raw encoded
        data, regions to be decoded and scaling information.

        When used in conjunction with per-tile painting this feature defers
        image decoding until the SkCanvas referencing the image is rasterized.

        Both recording and rasterization happen on the main thread.

        Performance Impact:

        This feature is enabled by WebKit::setDeferredImageDecodingEnabled()
        and does not have an impact when disabled.

        This feature is disabled by default.

        Upcoming Changes:

        1. Implement a full-featured image cache in ImageDecodingStore.
        2. Allow rasterization and decoding on impl thread.

        Classes Involved:

        BitmapImage

        BitmapImage is the entry point for deferred image decoding. When
        drawing a BitmapImage into a GraphicsContext it makes a request to
        create a NativeImageSkia. We substitute the content in NativeImageSkia
        such that it is lazily decoded.

        DeferredImageDecoder

        This is the platform implementation of a image decoder for Chromium.
        This is a bridge layer that either delegates calls to the actual
        ImageDecoder or create a lazily-decoded SkBitmap and delegates calls
        to ImageDecodingStore.

        ImageDecodingStore

        This object manages all encoded images. It keeps track of encoded
        data and the corresponding ImageDecoder for doing actual decoding. It
        is also responsible for generating lazily decoded SkBitmaps. This
        SkBitmap contains a LazyDecodingPixelRef object which references to an
        image entry in ImageDecodingStore.

        ScaledImageFragment

        A container for a scaled image fragment. In addition to bitmap pixels
        it contains information about the ID of the image, scale and clipping.

        ImageFrameGenerator

        This object is responsible for generating decoded pixels. It is also
        a container for encoded image data and corresponding image decoder.

        LazyDecodingPixelRef

        This object is embedded in a SkBitmap to enable lazy decoding. When
        SkBitmap needs to access pixels LazyDecodingPixelRef is locked. It
        contains information to locate an image and scaling info, these
        information is submitted to ImageDecodingStore to access actual pixels.

        Layout tests. There are about 80 tests in this virtual test suite
        running this feature in this directory:

        platform/chromium/virtual/deferred/fast/images

        Unit tests. Added DeferredImageDecoderTest to verify deferred
        image decoding behavior.

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        Most resource types that go through the memory cache (and therefore
        through SubresourceLoader) are not sensitive to the exact ordering of
        the callbacks they receive, particularly as it relates to ResourceLoadNotifier
        calls.  Main resources are not so lenient.  For main resources to be cacheable
        and maintain the current behavior as precisely as possible, we will need to
        rearrange SubresourceLoader's willSendRequest() and didReceiveData().

        No new tests, refactor only.

        * loader/SubresourceLoader.cpp:
        (WebCore::SubresourceLoader::willSendRequest): There are a series of checks that can result

            CachedResourceClient) has work it expects to do before ResourceLoader::willSendRequest()
            is called, but the calls are out of order for that, so swap those.
        (WebCore::SubresourceLoader::didReceiveData): We need to populate ResourceLoader::m_resourceData
            before notifying CachedResource of new data, but we also want to do CachedResourceClients calls
            before calling ResourceLoadNotifier. This means we can't delegate to ResourceLoader.

        AX: Refactor accessibility name computation so it's more platform independent
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99502

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        The current model of determining the accessible text for an object has a lot of Mac biases built in
        due to legacy implementation. 

        This change categorizes and orders accessibility text based on WAI-ARIA text computation rules and then
        allows the platform (only Mac right now) to decide how best to apply that text to its own AX API.
        http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#textalternativecomputation

        This change tried very hard not to change any test behavior, even though it exposed a number of weird
        edge cases where we were treating attributes differently based on element type. 

        Future patches will resolve those discrepancies.

        The bug was caused by positionOnlyToBeUpdated's offset not being shifted correctly in
        ReplaceSelectionCommand::mergeTextNodesAroundPosition. Suppose we have text nodes t1 and t2 and
        positionOnlyToBeUpdated had offset k in t2. When t2 is merged into t1, positionOnlyToBeUpdated should be
        moved to (t1, n + k) where n is the ORIGINAL length of t1 before t2 is merged. But we were using
        the length after t2 is merged.

        Fixed the bug by saving the original length of t1 and using that in the offset adjustment.
        Also use the right offset.

        [chromium] Implement deferred image decoding
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94240

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Objectives:

        To record image decoding operations during painting and to defer
        decoding operations until rasterization.

        Rationale:

        This is a key feature that enables impl-side painting which requires
        fast recording of drawing operations. The existing decode-on-draw
        restricts that recording has to block on expensive decoding operations.
        This change allows recording of image decoding operations during paint
        time.

        Design:

        Image decoding happens when a BitmapImage is drawn into a
        GraphicsContext. When per-tile painting is enabled GraphicsContext
        is backed by SkCanvas in recording mode. This SkCanvas records drawing
        and image decoding operations to minimize recording time.

        An image decoding operation is recorded as a SkPixelRef object
        implemented by LazyDecodingPixelRef. This object references raw encoded
        data, regions to be decoded and scaling information.

        When used in conjunction with per-tile painting this feature defers
        image decoding until the SkCanvas referencing the image is rasterized.

        Both recording and rasterization happen on the main thread.

        Performance Impact:

        This feature is enabled by WebKit::setDeferredImageDecodingEnabled()
        and does not have an impact when disabled.

        This feature is disabled by default.

        Upcoming Changes:

        1. Implement a full-featured image cache in ImageDecodingStore.
        2. Allow rasterization and decoding on impl thread.

        Classes Involved:

        BitmapImage

        BitmapImage is the entry point for deferred image decoding. When
        drawing a BitmapImage into a GraphicsContext it makes a request to
        create a NativeImageSkia. We substitute the content in NativeImageSkia
        such that it is lazily decoded.

        DeferredImageDecoder

        This is the platform implementation of a image decoder for Chromium.
        This is a bridge layer that either delegates calls to the actual
        ImageDecoder or create a lazily-decoded SkBitmap and delegates calls
        to ImageDecodingStore.

        ImageDecodingStore

        This object manages all encoded images. It keeps track of encoded
        data and the corresponding ImageDecoder for doing actual decoding. It
        is also responsible for generating lazily decoded SkBitmaps. This
        SkBitmap contains a LazyDecodingPixelRef object which references to an
        image entry in ImageDecodingStore.

        ScaledImageFragment

        A container for a scaled image fragment. In addition to bitmap pixels
        it contains information about the ID of the image, scale and clipping.

        ImageFrameGenerator

        This object is responsible for generating decoded pixels. It is also
        a container for encoded image data and corresponding image decoder.

        LazyDecodingPixelRef

        This object is embedded in a SkBitmap to enable lazy decoding. When
        SkBitmap needs to access pixels LazyDecodingPixelRef is locked. It
        contains information to locate an image and scaling info, these
        information is submitted to ImageDecodingStore to access actual pixels.

        Layout tests. There are about 80 tests in this virtual test suite
        running this feature in this directory:

        platform/chromium/virtual/deferred/fast/images

        Unit tests. Added DeferredImageDecoderTest to verify deferred
        image decoding behavior.

        Handle if we fail to allocate nonPlatformCanvas in ImageBuffer constructor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99752

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Current code does not check if we were able to allocate the pixels, but still returns the canvas.
        However, the caller explicitly is checking for null on failure, so it will continue (and possibly
        crash later on).
        This change brings the nonPlatformCanvas behavior inline with createAcceleratedCanvas and
        TryCreateBitmapCanvas, both of which are also called by ImageBuffer's constructor.

        No new tests. Existing tests exercise ImageBuffer constructor.

        <rdar://problem/12491901>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/130783 changed the lifetime of the 
        ScrollingStateTree's rootStateNode. Before that patch, the root state 
        node was never destroyed. It was just constantly re-used for 
        different RenderLayerBackings. This crash is just one of a few bugs 
        that has occurred because of that change. I have fixed the other bugs 
        individually, but I think that long-term, it is the safest solution 
        to go back to the original ownership model.

        So this patch ensures that the state tree will always have a root 
        state node. Instead of destroying and re-creating the root node when 
        it's scroll ID changes, we just update the ID.

        attachToStateTree() now takes an additional ID representing the ID of 
        the parent node.

        GraphicsSurface should not modify the current GL context.

        Instead of reusing the currently bound GL context for drawing
        the texture onto the GraphicsSurface, GraphicsSurface should
        create a new context that shares the texture names with a context
        provided by the caller.
        This way the OpenGL states are clearly separated and we do not

        Move mixed content logic out of FrameLoader
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45638

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        This change moves checks for mixed content out of FrameLoader, and into
        a new MixedContentChecker object. It's a pretty straightforward
        refactoring with no change to the overall logic, and only minor changes
        to the code to reduce repetition.

        The only substantive change is renaming the methods from 'checkIf*' to
        'can*' to reflect the value of the boolean they return.

        The visible functionality shouldn't change; this change should be
        covered by existing tests in http/tests/security/mixedContent.

        When the base character of a combining character sequence is not covered by any one of the

        Incorrect rendering of borders on <col> with span > 1
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76246

        Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

        The HTML5 rendering specification [10.2.2 - Display Types] states that
        "For the purposes of the CSS table model, the col element is expected to
        be treated as if it was present as many times as its span attribute
        specifies."
        We should thus apply a col element's border as if the element is present
        as many number of times as its span attribute.

        Apart from this, we should also treat the col and its enclosing colgroup
        separately while computing the collapsed borders.

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        ContentData are conceptually very similar to Nodes and we can use
        the same createRenderer pattern on them to simplify creating
        renderers for generated content. Now each ContentData class knows
        how to create its own renderer.

        Previously we switched over the StyleContentType which required a
        case for CONTENT_NONE and made the code look like it could return
        null, but this case is actually impossible because no ContentData
        class ever has a type of CONTENT_NONE and no null checks are really
        needed.

        This is the final step in removing dependence on StyleContentType.

        No new tests needed, this is just a refactor.

        GraphicsLayer visible rect computation needs to use the current animating transform
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99529

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        If we're running an accelerated animation of transform
        on a GraphicsLayerCA, the current value of the transform won't
        be reflected in the GraphicsLayer's m_transform. However,
        we need the current value of the transform in order to correctly
        compute the visible rect of this layer and descendants.
        
        Add a function to GraphicsLayerClient to retrieve the current
        value of the transform from the client.
        
        RenderLayer's currentTransform() used to return a transform
        with transform-origin baked in; GraphicsLayerClient needs one
        that excludes transform-origin, so enhance RenderLayer::currentTransform()
        to be able to produce either.

        plugins: Allow a plugin to dictate whether it can receive drag events or not.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99355

        Reviewed by Tony Chang.

        When doing a drag over a plugin, ask the plugin whether it can accept
        drag/drop to decide whether drag/drop is possible or not. At present,
        plugins do not receive drag events through WebCore (i.e. various
        implementations of PluginView::handleMouseEvent ignores the
        drop-events). This change makes it possible for the ports to ask the
        plugin first to decide whether it can (or wants to) accept drag events.
        The default implementation remains the same, i.e. plugins do not receive
        drag events. For chromium, the overridden implementation uses the
        WebPlugin interface to check whether the plugin can accept drag events.

        Make RenderObject destruction during detach a top-down operation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98336

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        detach() is a DOM-driven operation that destroys the renderers bottom-up.
        While this is correct, it causes extra-work to be done (tree cleaning, ...)
        as it doesn't know about the render tree's structure.

        The render tree on the other side already supports top-down operations
        but it was overriden by the DOM side of detach.

        This change only makes ContainerNode::detach do a top-down render tree
        destruction. This is a required step towards doing smarter destruction.

        Refactoring covered by existing tests.

        * dom/ContainerNode.cpp:
        (WebCore::ContainerNode::detach):
        Changed the method to do a top-down destruction.

        * dom/Node.cpp:
        (WebCore::Node::detach):
        Added this ASSERT that ensures that we have properly cleaned up the
        whole DOM subtree. The only exception is child content belonging to a
        flow-thread as the code will shuffle the renderers under the flow-thread.

        * rendering/RenderObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderObject::willBeDestroyed):
        As we don't update the node's renderer on the DOM side, do it here.
        The upside is that it ensures that we don't left any stray renderer
        in the tree.

        * rendering/RenderObjectChildList.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderObjectChildList::destroyLeftoverChildren):
        Removed the calls to setRenderer as they are redundant with what we do

        (WebCore::RenderTextFragment::setText):

        Make ScrollingTree an actual tree of nodes, and have it reflect the 
        ScrollingStateTree

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch finally makes the ScrollingTree over on the 
        ScrollingThread aware of the changes that we have been making to the 
        ScrollingStateTree.

        First, it makes ScrollingTreeNode a much more generic class, similar 
        to ScrollingStateNode. It is an abstract class and we will add other 
        types of nodes such as ScrollingTreeFixedNodes that will inherit from 
        this class. 

        All of the scrolling functionality that was in ScrollingTreeNode has 
        been moved to ScrollingTreeScrollingNode. And likewise, 
        ScrollingTreeNodeMac has been re-named to 
        ScrollingTreeScrollingNodeMac. 

        And finally, instead of just updating and creating the root node, 
        ScrollingTree now recurses through the whole ScrollingStateTree to 
        create and update a full tree of nodes.

        New files and moves files.
        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:

        Add a getter for the children vector since we need to recurse it in 
        ScrollingTree.

        * page/scrolling/ScrollingTree.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScrollingTree::ScrollingTree):

        Instead of just updating the root node, call two new functions that 
        will take care of updating the whole tree.
        (WebCore::ScrollingTree::commitNewTreeState):

        This function ecurses through the ScrollingStateTree and updates the 
        corresponding ScrollingTreeNodes.
        (WebCore::ScrollingTree::updateNodesFromStateNode):

        This function takes the ScrollingStateTree's list of removed nodes 
        and removes the corresponding nodes from the ScrollingTree. It will 
        destroy the nodes after removing it as long as it's not the root 
        node. I think it's the safest choice for now to never remove the root 
        node. 
        (WebCore::ScrollingTree::removeDestroyedNodes):

        ScrollingTree now keeps a HashMap mapping ScrollingNodeIDs to 
        ScrollingTreeNodes.

        An feImage that tries to render itself should be stopped
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94652

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        An SVG feImage filter element will accept, as the src to render, an
        SVG document that makes use of the feImage itself. This causes the
        feImage to try to draw itself while already in the process of drawing
        itself. Various problems arise from this. The invariant we wish to
        maintain is that no element in the src tree of an feImage element
        refers to that feImage.

        This patch adds a flag to all FilterData objects that tracks whether or
        not the filter is currently applying itself, and avoids applying the
        filter recursively.

        While it may seem better to catch this problem when the src is set, or
        when the filter is built, that turns out to be challenging and
        inefficient. Say we choose to test when the src atttribute is set. To
        do so would require looking through all of the DOM nodes that will be
        rendered for the src, finding all resources used, and checking if any
        of them make use fo the feImage element that we are setting the source
        for. The infrastructure is not in place to do that, and it would
        involve walking a potentially very large portion of the DOM in order
        to detect a very rare situation. Note that it is not enough just to
        walk the DOM directly under the src; we also need to recursively follow any
        resource links to see if they use the feImage (e.g. patterns or
        masks or use or ...).

        If we instead try to use the renderer node to find self referencing,
        we need to recursively walk a potentially very large render tree,
        tracing all resources in search of the feImage. This would need to be
        done every time the filter is built, which is again a significant
        overhead for a situation that is very unlikely to occur. And we do not
        have methods that make it easy to find feImage filter effect nodes; they are
        hidden behind filter resource nodes.

        Hence the runtime check to catch the problem. The check must be in
        FilterData and RenderSVGResourceFilter code because we must prevent
        the destruction of the feImage when we encounter it recursively.

        This patch also renames FilterData::builded to FilterData::isBuilt.

        [Texmap] Refactor TextureMapperShaderManager to be clearer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86048

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        Previous implementation of TextureMapperShaderManager was very verbose, calling for too
        many casts and ambiguous ownership.
        This refactor does the following:
        1. TextureMapperShaderProgram is one class without subclasses.
        2. Uniform/Attribute accessors are generated by special macros (TEXMAP_DECLARE_...) that
           generate both the C++ access function, as well as the GLSL name of the variable. This

           before.

        The render bus used in GStreamer's implementation of AudioDestination no longer
        allocates memory for each of its channels. Rather than that, when looping, the
        data is rendered into a channel-specific GstBuffer. Each buffer is then chained
        to the appropriate GstPad, as has been the case before.

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        setCellLogicalWidths was implemented as a pre-phase to laying out
        the table's sections. This split was artificial as any change in
        the columns' logical width should trigger a sections' relayout, which
        could propagate and mark the cells / rows as needed.

        Merging setCellLogicalWidths into RenderTableSection::layout removes
        an unneeded cells walking and some clunkiness from our implementation.

        (WebCore::RenderTable):

        CSS seems appropriate.

        As a first pass at a reasonable whitelist, this patch allows
        'background[-*]', 'border[-*]', 'color[-*]', 'font[-*]',
        'margin[-*]', 'padding[-*]', 'text[-*]', '-webkit-background[-*]',
        '-webkit-border[-*]', '-webkit-font[-*]', '-webkit-margin[-*]',
        '-webkit-padding[-*]', and '-webkit-text[-*]'.

            the actual console message.
        (WebInspector.ConsoleMessageImpl.prototype._formatWithSubstitutionString.isWhitelistedProperty):
             Returns true if the specific style is whitelisted. Expects styles
             in the hyphenated form (that is, '-webkit-padding-start' rather than
             CSSOM's 'webkitPaddingStart').

        Warn when CSP headers don't separate directives with ';'.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99274

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        A recent bug report exhibited confusion as to what role, exactly,
        semicolons play in Content Security Policy definitions. This patch
        adjusts the parser to warn web authors if a directive name is
        encountered while parsing a source list, which would almost certainly
        point to a missing semicolon. For example, something like:

            script-src 'self' object-src 'self' style-src *

        would throw two warnings, noting that 'object-src' and 'style-src' are
        probably meant as directives, and not as source expressions in the
        'script-src' source list.

        This patch introduces RTCDataChannel which is a pipe for sending data between two RTCPeerConnections.
        Since the data channel belongs to a peer connection object I have reused part of its infrastructure.

        This change is to first, correct webkit to only set isOpaque when the frame is complete, so that

        [CSS Shaders] Add CustomFilterProgramType to CustomFilterProgramInfo
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96448

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        CustomFilterProgramInfo has been refactored to decouple the CustomFilterProgramType from
        the CustomFilterProgramMixSetting: m_mixSettings.enabled was redundant in light of the fact
        that m_programType encoded the very same information. Dependencies have been updated to reflect
        this change.

        Current tests already cover this code.

        * css/CSSComputedStyleDeclaration.cpp: 
        (WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::valueForFilter): The check for mixSettings.enabled has been replaced
        by an explicit check for PROGRAM_TYPE_BLENDS_ELEMENT_TEXTURE program type.

        [CSSRegions]Add support for auto-height regions (without region-breaks)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97533

        Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

        Implement the 2pass layout algorithm for computing the height of regions with auto logical height, without taking region breaks into account.
        The algorithm is described in the CSSRegions spec: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-regions/#regions-visual-formatting-steps

        When the flow thread contains regions with auto logical height, a 2pass layout algorithm is needed to determine the height of auto logical height regions.
        In each step of the layout, the regions are laid out before the flow thread is laid out.

        In the first pass of layout (normal layout phase), the content of the flow thread is laid out unconstrained in the regions. The region marked as having auto logical height
        displays all the corresponding content from the flow thread (taking min-height and max-height into account), and the height of the content displayed
        determines the overridden logical content height. Thus, after the first pass of layout, each auto logical height region will store the logical height
        value for the second pass in its overridden logical content height property.

        In the second pass of layout (constrained flow threads layout phase), when the content of the flow thread is laid out constrained in the regions, the regions are laid out again and they are using
        the overridden logical content height from the first pass to update their logical height. Then, the flow thread content is laid out in the associated region chain,
        for which the auto logical height regions have proper logical height.

        A future patch will properly take region breaks into account for the first pass of layout.

        source expressions has been tuned to support file-level granularity. In
        particular, this means that:

        - 'example.com/js' matches a file named 'js'
        - 'example.com/js/' matches all files under a directory named 'js'

        - 'example.com/js/file.js' matches only a file named 'file.js'
          inside a directory named 'js'

        Though this is part of the CSP 1.1 spec, it continues to be exposed
        outside the CSP_NEXT flag for back-compatibility.

        Update RenderText to use String instead of UChar* for text
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96979

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        RenderText now uses a String for text.  It keeps a cached LCHar* or UChar* pointer to the
        actual text data for performance.  Added a characterAt() indexed accessor to RenderText to avoid the
        somewhat confusing construct for a RenderText* rt, e.g. (*re)[n] or rt->characters()[n].  This is
        now written as rt->characterAt(n).
        Enabled patch in the HTML parser to create 8 bit text data.  Modified TextRun to create 
        text runs using 8 bit string data where possible.  Added several flavors of RenderBlock::constructTextRun
        to create TextRuns from RenderText objects including with an offset.  Added an LChar flavor of constructTextRun()
        as well.  Eliminated the TextRunFlags argument to all but the String flavor as all other flavors used the default
        parameter.  
        Encased the code that creates 8 bit TextRun's in #if USE(8BIT_TEXTRUN).  Enabled WTF_USE_8BIT_TEXTRUN
        for PLATFORM(MAC).  Other platform can update this setting in Platform.h when their platform specific code is
        updated to TextRun's with 8 bit data.
        Added many 8/16 bit aware paths.  Cleanup up some int / unsigned confusion in RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp.

        No function change therefore no new tests.

        (GenerateImplementation): getOwnPropertySlotByIndex doesn't need to prefer
        string lookup in the static table because our static tables don't contain
        properties that are numbers.

        I believe this is low-hanging fruit left behind by Phil's
        getOwnPropertySlotByIndex optimization, but it's also possible that this was a

        Fix GraphicsLayerCA visible rect computation in the face of perspective and preserve-3d
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99212

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        GraphicsLayerCA::computeVisibleRect() was incorrect for layer trees with perspective
        and preserve-3d, so fix that, and add some tests.
        
        Perspective is implemented via childrenTransform(); if our parent has one,
        we have to left-multiply this into the transformation matrix.
        
        We have to test both this layer and its parent when deciding whether to accumulate
        or flatten.
        
        Use state.mappedQuad() rather than state.lastPlanarQuad(), because the last planar
        quad might be for some distant ancestor, and there may be intermediate preserve-3d
        layers.

        ScrollingStateNodes should keep track of their IDs

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        There is a HashMap in ScrollingCoordinatorMac that maps 
        ScrollingNodeIDs to ScrollingStateNodes. The nodes themselves should 
        keep track of this id. Then the id can be used to make sure 
        ScrollingStateNodes remove themselves from the HashMap when they are 
        destroyed, and it will also be useful for associating 
        ScrollingStateNodes with ScrollingTreeNodes over on the scrolling 
        thread.
  
        This patch only has the ScrollingStateNodes cache the id. I will

        Web Inspector: Refactor UISourceCode, make it possible to distinguish working copy changes/commits from formatting.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98911

        Reviewed by Pavel Feldman.

        ContentChanged was dispatched both when working copy was committed and UISourceCode was formatted before.
        WorkingCopyChanged event was dispatched when working copy was set.
        Now there are three explicit events: WorkingCopyChanged, WorkingCopyCommitted, FormattedChanged.
        No events are dispatched now during revisions restoring.
        Reverting to revisions is now implemented based on the working copy editing.

        [V8] PerContextEnabled methods should be installed when the constructor is created
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99129

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        Before this change, generated installPerContextProperties() method
        injected both per-context attributes and functions, and functions
        were injected into the prototye object.  This means that the
        functions are injected into the prototype repeatedly for each
        intance creation.  This injection can be happened only once per
        prototype object, which is clearer and is faster.

        This change introduces installPerContextPrototypeProperties()
        generated method, which is designed to be called for each time when the prototype
        object is created.

        To do that, WrapperTypeInfo is extended to hold an additional
        function pointer to an installPerContextPrototypeProperties()
        implementation so that we call it from V8PerContextData::constructorForTypeSlowCase(),
        where the prototype instance is created.

        Other changes:
        - Added some modification to pass around the parameter to constructorForTypeSlowCase().
        - installPerContextProperties() are now always generated for simplicity. Empty implementations are inlined thus
          no speed penalty.

        No new tests. Covered by existing tests.

        [Qt][WK2] GraphicsSurfaceGLX should keep track of previous GL context.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99076

        In GraphicsSurfaceGLX/GraphicsSurfacePrivate we create a new
        QOpenGLContext for resolving GL methods.
        This context is implicitly made current on creation.
        Therefore we need to keep track of the previously bound context
        and make that one current again after calling create.

        ScrollingCoordinator is a hot mess of if-defs

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        This patch moves all of the threaded scrolling code in 
        ScrollingCoordinator into a new class called ScrollingCoordinatorMac 
        which inherits from ScrollingCoordinator. 

        It also adds ScrollingCoordinatorChromium to do Chromium-specific work. 
        ScrollingCoordinator itself does work that is cross-platform. 
        
        Finally, this patch also eliminates ScrollingCoordinatorNone. 
        ScrollingCoordinator is now sufficient for platforms that relied on 
        ScrollingCoordinatorNone to build.

        LocalCurrentGraphicsContext will never restore the current context to null
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99122

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        LocalCurrentGraphicsContext is meant to cause temporary changes to
        NSGraphicsContext's currentContext. However, if it is entered when
        currentContext is null, it will not restore to null, as a null
        m_savedNSGraphicsContext was being used to indicate that the current and
        passed-in graphics contexts were equal (and thus no save/restore was required).

        Add a separate flag for whether or not we need to restore the context.

        Also flip the order of calls to restore graphics context state so that
        exiting LocalCurrentGraphicsContext does things in exactly the opposite
        of entry.

        [Sub pixel layout] Fast-path iframe scrolling can picks up an extra pixel
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98571

        Reviewed by Emil A Eklund.

        Refactoring all coordinate-switching functionality to use a single "mode" flag
        as opposed to having a bunch of boolean values. This enables the same set of
        options across the board, and a consistent interface. This was previously
        done for mapLocalToContainer.

        The imptetus for this for this stems from the one logical change in this patch
        which only effects sub-pixel layout. FrameView::convertToRenderer and
        convertFromRenderer return IntPoint coordinates, and need to also snap transform
        offsets to determine proper rects for scrolling.

        Unlabeled functions below are simply being updated to these new interfaces.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97825

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Adds a DocumentOrderedMap to TreeScope that allows accessibility to
        quickly map from an id to the label for that id. This speeds up
        AccessibilityNode::labelForElement, which was a bottleneck in Chromium
        when accessibility was on.

        [WebGL] [Mac] only the mapped symbol for the first element of a uniform/attribute array is stored.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98966

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We currently do not add name/mappedName symbol pairs for each element of a uniform/attribute array.
        This is because we only add a number of symbols equal to how many symbols the shader compiler tells us there are.
        The shader compiler treats an array as a single uniform. We need to be adding in symbols to the map for each element of the array ourselves.
        The mappedName of each array element is the same between elements except for the "[index]" at the end so this is easy to do.

        [CSS Shaders] Make custom filters use a premultiplied buffer.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98396

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Currently, a GLSL css_Composite function returns a premultiplied color, so
        FECustomFilter must make a premultiplied buffer in the case when an author is
        using the CSS mix function.

        In addition, there are two performance benefits when FECustomFilter uses a premultiplied buffer.
        1. FilterEffect::asImageBuffer is faster.
        2. In the future when Accelerated Compositing implementations use
        FECustomFilter, they do not need to convert an unmultiplied buffer to a
        premultiplied buffer.

        Adding support for secure ProtectionSpaces in Credentials
        to prevent credentials from being overwritten/used when the user

        PR 199457

        The issue was the secure/non-secure version of the same protocol
        were using the same ProtectionSpace enum in the network stack. When
        the credentials are saved, it will overwrite each other since the
        protection object is identical.

        The fix is to use the WebKit provided secure enums when the protcol is secure.

        To test this, access a restricted site that is running on http. Save the
        password and access the same restricted site (same domain
        and path) but on https. The browser should prompt for credentials.

        Also see the related W3C bug:

        Since this change breaks existing behavior, we have to update several code at once, which includes:
        - ContentDistributer: ContentDistributor now re-projects distributed nodes.
        - ComposedShadowTreeWalker: ComposedShadowTreeWalker is now aware of re-projection. That can
          resolve re-projection transparently.
        - AncestorChainWalker (formerly named ComposedShadowTreeParentWallker):
          AncestorChainWalker is now aware of re-projection. I've also added a crossingInsertionPoint()
          member function so that clients of the walker can know whether the walker is just crossing
          insertion points for a re-projected node.
        - EventDispatcher: EventDispatcher now uses the updated AncestorChainWalker and its
          crossingInsertionPoint() so that EventDispatcher can compute relative target for each ancestor correctly.

        I've also updated existing layout tests and added some layout tests for re-projection.
        Re-projection for multiple shadow root is not supported yet. I'll address that in another bug.

        When we implement content reprojection in ShadowDOM, we have to pass a node pool to SelectorChecker.
        We introdue ShadowDOMSiblingTraversalStrategy, which traverses a node pool instead of real node siblings.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Elements with style specified from an attribute selector in conjunction
        with a pseudo-element should not take on the shared style of their
        previous matching sibling (if any).

        The problem here is that an attribute selector appended by a pseudo-element
        does not return any matched rules for the call (matchesRuleSet(m_uncommonAttributeRuleSet.get()))
        in StyleResolver::locateSharedStyle().

        This is because of the way pseudo-elements are handled in
        SelectorChecker::checkSelector(). For a pseudo-element selector we check
        for the condition (!context.elementStyle && m_mode == ResolvingStyle) and
        since for this particular flow the SelectorChecker mode is set to ResolvingStyle
        and since the current element's style is still not available we fail this
        initial check and return SelectorFailsLocally from checkSelector(). This is
        incorrect behavior since the element does have an attribute selector specified
        for it.

        Have thus introduced another enum value: SharingRules for SelectorChecker's Mode.
        SelectorChecker's mode should be set to SharingRules before making the
        call to collectMatchingRules() and then reset (back to ResolvingStyle) thereafter.

        Existing Mode value: CollectingRules although appropriate cannot be used in this
        scenario because we also don't want to set any value to dynamicPseudo for this flow.

        * css/SelectorChecker.cpp:
        (WebCore::SelectorChecker::checkSelector):

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80838

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Currently newline characters are replaced with spaces when pasted
        to text input. This behavior was introduced in r37539, with the
        intention to follow the FireFox's behavior (see
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20461). However, FireFox
        truncates newlines at the end of pasted text, instead of replacing
        them with spaces. So this patch changes TextFieldInputType to cut
        trailing newlines of inserted text.

        Record page creation/deletion, so it knows what page is present or not.
        Record page visibility change so it knows when to display a dialog or not.
        Accept authentication challenge, and decide whether to postpone the
            challenge dialog based on whether there is active authentication challenge
            dialog already and whether its page is visible or not.
        When a challenge result comes back, notify the result to all clients
            authenticating for the same protection space, and then start the next
            authentication challenge from the same page, if there is one.
        When a page becomes visible, start the first authentication challenge
            dialog that has been blocked before.
        When an authentication challenge is requested, the NetworkJob will be
            deferred so its initial response will be saved while waiting for

        Reimplement generated content :before and :after as DOM Elements. Now ElementRareData has
        two RefPtrs to PseudoElements for the generated content and Node has methods for traversing
        the tree including generated content.

        This allows the generated content to be treated as real nodes instead of anonymous and take
        part in the usual recalcStyle and attach flow which fixes many bugs and vastly simplifies the
        lifecycle of generated content.

        SVGTextRunRenderingContext changes font data in the glyph page, but it shouldn't
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98755

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        The code in SVGTextRunRenderingContext::glyphDataForCharacter, when it
        encounters an <altglyph> tag, immediately replaces the font data for a
        glyph with font data for the primary font, presumably to meet the SVG
        spec requirement: "If the references to alternate glyphs do not result
        in successful identification of alternate glyphs to use, then the
        character(s) that are inside of the ‘altGlyph’ element are rendered as
        if the ‘altGlyph’ element were a ‘tspan’ element instead."

        If the alt glyph is not then found we are in the case from the spec
        and indeed we should use the primary font. However, we end up replacing the GlyphPage
        entry for the character with primary font data, which we should not do
        because the glyph page might be used in some place that does not have
        the alt glyph tag.

        Furthermore, this causes object lifetime problems for font data, because
        in cases where the font data that is replaced is for the system fallback
        font the GlyphPage will live forever with no knowldege that it contains
        font data pointers into font data other that the system fallback. The
        replaced font data may be deleted while the pointer lives on in the
        system fallback page.

        The fix is simply not to replace the font data in the page.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98965

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        The code of ResourceErrorMac when using CFNetwork was assuming
        there is always either a CFError or an NSError associated with
        any ResourceError.

        This is not true on WebKit2 where error can be generic errors
        in the WebProcess (for example a cannotShowURLError).
        The code was crashing when trying to invoke function on the
        non-existing CFError.

        This patch fixes the issue by handling that third case separately.
        If the ResourceError is a generic error, a new NSError is created,
        similarily to what is done in the non-CFNetwork case.

        [Chromium] Smoother animation for non-RAF 2D canvas animations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97918

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        Reduces animation jank by preventing the accumulation of multiple
        frames of backlog in the deferred canvas rendering queue. When the
        animation is more than one full frame ahead of the compositor, an
        immediate flush is triggered.  This takes into account overdraw
        elimination by the skip-on-clear optimization that is built-in to
        SkDeferredCanvas, to allow non-RAF animations that clear the canvas at
        each frame to run without any rate limiting. This change also
        incidentally improves frame rate in many cases by providing more
        granular batching of GPU API calls, resulting in better pipelining
        through the command buffer.

        Switch CachedResource over from SharedBuffer to a new ResourceBuffer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98541

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        As part of preparation for a WebKit2 NetworkProcess, we need to change the data handle shared
        between CachedResources and ResourceLoaders to be one that can be backed by something other
        than a SharedBuffer.

        ResourceBuffer is this new object. Right now it is directly backed by a SharedBuffer and there
        should be no change in behavior.

        SQLResultSet.rowsAffected not cleared
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46070

        Reviewed by Kenneth Rohde Christiansen.

        SQLResultSet.rowsAffected is supposed to return the number
        of rows that were changed by the statement. For "SELECT"
        statements, it should return 0.

        However, our implementation currently relies on sqlite3_changes()
        to compute this value. sqlite3_changes() returns the number of
        direct row changes in the most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
        statement within the same trigger context. Unfortunately, the
        most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement may not be the
        last statement. As a consequence, if you INSERT 1 row, then
        do a SELECT, SQLResultSet.rowsAffected will be 1 for both the
        INSERT and the SELECT statements.

        The proposed solution is to use sqlite3_total_changes() instead
        of sqlite3_changes(). sqlite3_total_changes() returns the number
        of row changes caused by INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements since
        the database connection was opened. We now store the value
        returned by sqlite3_total_changes() before each statement in
        order to return the count difference in
        SQLiteDatabase::lastChanges().

        Text Autosizing: Counteract funky window sizing on Android.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98809

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        In Chrome for Android, the window sizes provided to WebCore are
        currently in physical screen pixels instead of
        device-scale-adjusted units. For example window width on a
        Galaxy Nexus is 720 instead of 360.  Text autosizing expects
        device-independent pixels.  When Chrome for Android cuts over to
        the new coordinate space, it will be tied to the setting
        applyPageScaleFactorInCompositor.

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        Since we are measuring each word to find out where the line break should occur,
        we should cache that information to avoid measuring the run again when
        creating the line box. The bulk of the change is in nextLineBreak, where
        the measurements are collected and placed in a vector so that they can
        be consumed in setLogicalWidthForTextRun where we used to measure the
        text one more time.
        Each entry in the vector is a WordMeasurement object that contains information
        about the start and end offset in the run, the renderer, the measured width
        and, possibly, a list of fallback fonts.
        When we need to compute the width of the run to create the line box, we add
        all the measurements for the given renderer in the run to get the total width.
        This optiomization is currently disabled for platforms using HarfBuzz.

        Update the CSS property used to support draggable regions.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97156

        Reviewed by Adam Barth.

        The CSS property to support draggable regions has been changed from
        "-webkit-widget-region" to "-webkit-app-region" in the following syntax:
           -webkit-app-region: drag|no-drag

        The CSS parsing code for draggable regions is now different from the CSS
        parsing code for dashboard regions since we have quite different syntax.

        We still try to share as much rendering update code as possible for
        these two features. To make the shared code easier to understand for
        both features, the name "DashboardRegions" in the shared code is changed
        to "AnnotatedRegions" to work for both dashboard regions and draggable
        regions.

        Note that we still using WIDGET_REGION as feature name in order not to
        add more changes to this patch. It will be renamed to a more appropriate
        name in next patch. WIDGET_REGION is now only turned on for the chromium

        DOM/textarea-edit.html spends 35% of time in numGraphemeClusters

        Reviewed by Kent Tamura.

        Since the number of characters is always greater than the number of grapheme clusters,
        we can avoid calling computeLengthForSubmission when the number of characters is less
        than maxlength. We still have to count the number of LFs since they all need to be
        converted into CRLFs. This improves WebKit's score on DOM/textarea-edit.html by 45%.

        <rdar://problem/12080821>

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        Since we are measuring each word to find out where the line break should occur,
        we should cache that information to avoid measuring the run again when
        creating the line box. The bulk of the change is in nextLineBreak, where
        the measurements are collected and placed in a vector so that they can
        be consumed in setLogicalWidthForTextRun where we used to measure the
        text one more time.
        Each entry in the vector is a WordMeasurement object that contains information
        about the start and end offset in the run, the renderer, the measured width
        and, possibly, a list of fallback fonts.
        When we need to compute the width of the run to create the line box, we add
        all the measurements for the given renderer in the run to get the total width.

        (WebCore::Font::width): Added fallback fonts parameter.

        [Sub pixel layout] Fast-path iframe scrolling can picks up an extra pixel
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98571

        Reviewed by Emil A Eklund.

        Refactoring all coordinate-switching functionality to use a single "mode" flag
        as opposed to having a bunch of boolean values. This enables the same set of
        options across the board, and a consistent interface. This was previously
        done for mapLocalToContainer.

        The imptetus for this for this stems from the one logical change in this patch
        which only effects sub-pixel layout. FrameView::convertToRenderer and
        convertFromRenderer return IntPoint coordinates, and need to also snap transform
        offsets to determine proper rects for scrolling.

        Unlabeled functions below are simply being updated to these new interfaces.

        ScrollingStateNodes should be referenced via IDs on 
        RenderLayerBacking

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch associates all ScrollingStateNodes with a 
        RenderLayerBacking via a HashMap from RenderLayerBackings to 
        ScrollingStateNodes on ScrollingCoordinator. Prior to this patch, the 
        root ScrollingStateNode was created immediately upon creation of the 
        ScrollingCoordinator, and it was constantly re-used for every main 
        FrameView. This doesn't work in the new model since that doesn't 
        allow that ScrollingStateNode to have a definite association with a 
        RenderLayerBacking. So this patch does also introduce some lifetime 
        differences with the ScrollingStateNodes.

        If a page is going into the page cache, we should clear the state 
        tree. When the page is in the cache, we won't have access to the 
        RenderLayerBacking, and we don't want to be doing anything with the 
        ScrollingStateNodes anyway.

        Prevent animation when CSS attributeType is invalid.

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        This patch changes hasValidAttributeType() to return false when
        we have attributeType=CSS with a non-CSS attribute name.

        Previously we would animate non-CSS attributes when attributeType was
        CSS which resulted in crashes. To track this case, this patch catches
        changes to targetElement, attributeName, and attributeType and checks
        if an invalid combination is present. If invalid, hasInvalidCSSAttributeType()
        will return true causing hasValidAttributeType() to return false and prevent
        the animation from running.

        This change extracts StyleScopeResolver from StyleResolver to clarify
        the responsibility of the style scope handling. Now we can easily see
        where the style scoping needs to be involed.

        Coming Shadow DOM related change like @host rules will fit within this class.

        [Qt] Make RenderThemeQStyle/ScrollbarThemeQStyle compile without QStyle/QtWidgets
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98268

        Reviewed by Tor Arne Vestbø.

        Extracted QStyle/QWidget related code into a QWebStyle class that implements the QStyleFacade interface.

        QStyleFacade is a pure interface that lives in WebCore/platform/qt
        (next to RenderThemeQStyle and ScrollbarThemeQStyle) and provides a
        minimal interface of what we need to draw with QStyle as well as basic
        hit testing and metric retrieval. It also provides a
        QStyleFacadeOption class that aggregates common meta-data for
        rendering primitives, such as direction, rectangle, state (sunken,
        enabled, etc.) or palette. It also provides some more slider/scrollbar
        specific fields in a slider sub-structure.

        RenderThemeQStyle/ScrollbarThemeQStyle used to instantiate specific QStyleOption sub-classes and populate
        them with state information from render objects, before calling straight to QStyle. Most of the common code
        was encapsulated in StylePainterQStyle.

        The new RenderThemeQStyle/ScrolllbarThemeQStyle uses common code in
        StylePainterQStyle to populate state into QStyleFacadeOption before
        calling into QStyleFacade.

        The style facade is then implemented by QStyleFacadeImp, which extracts
        meta-data from QStyleFacadeOption arguments, populates style
        primitive specific QStyleOption objects and then calls on QStyle.

        RenderThemeQStyle/ScrollbarThemeQStyle can only use interface methods
        from QStyleFacade. QStyleFacadeImp on the other hand will live in the
        separate QtWebKitWidgets library in the future and therefore cannot use
        any WebCore types.

        This is very small potatoes.  There are much bigger wins for table layout yet, but
        this was an easy win.

        This function should probably be converted to use int's only, as table cells are pixel-sized
        according to our subpixel-experts.

        Also, I suspect there should be ways to early return with less-math in the common cases, but
        I've saved such for a later patch.

        Note that I changed from using paddingBefore/paddingAfter (which include the instrinsic padding)
        to calling computedCSSPaddingBefore/computedCSSPaddingAfter directly as well.

        Now that we don't expose BlobBuilder as a web platform API, we can

        [CSS Exclusions] Add support for polygonal shapes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96811

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Initial version of the layout support for polygonal exclusion shapes: the ExclusionPolygon class.
        Supports the public ExclusionShape operations using the algorithm described here:
        http://hansmuller-webkit.blogspot.com/2012/06/horizontal-box-polygon-intersection-for.html.
        Although both the "included" and "excluded" operations are supported, only the former is
        used, since only shape-inside is supported at the moment.

        The ExclusionPolygon class stores the polygon's edges in an interval tree.

        Polygon edges are represented by the ExclusionPolygonEdge struct, which records the indices of
        the pair of vertices joined by the edge.  Edge vertex index1 is usually less than index2, except
        the last edge where index2 is 0.  We plan to improve the algorithm that creates the edges
        by spanning vertices contained in sequences of more than two colinear vertices. For example,
        a triangular polygon might be specified with 5 vertices like this: 3,0 5,0, 5,5, 4,4 2,2, 0,0.
        By spanning the extra colinear points: 0,0 5,0, 5,5, which implies index1-index2 edges: 5-1 1-2 2-5.

        Although the implementation supports complex polygons, the layout code is limited to
        essentially rectangular shapes until a patch for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96813
        lands.

        In a line such as '<span><span><img>Text' the border, padding and margin belonging
        to the two spans was counted twice by RenderBlockLineLayout::nextLineBreak(): once
        when adding the width of the <img> object to the line, and a second time when adding
        the 'Text'. The result was that nextLineBreak() now had a length for the line that 
        exceeded the line's maximum length and inserted a bogus line break.

        This all happened because the helper function that is used to add in the border etc.
        from inline ancestors was crawling up the tree each time. It doesn't need to do that, it
        should stop crawling up the tree when the current object is not the first or last sibling below a parent.

        Test: fast/inline/bpm-inline-ancestors.html

        * rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
        (WebCore::shouldAddBorderPaddingMargin): Broke this check out into a helper function so that it 
        can help inlineLogicalWidth() return early and also treat empty RenderTexts the same as no previous/next
        sibling on the line. This ensures that collapsed leading space does not interfere with the decision to
        crawl up the ancestors accumulating border, padding, and margin.
        (WebCore):
        (WebCore::inlineLogicalWidth): Return early once the current child is no longer on the edge of its line - 
        this ensures the border, padding and margin of ancestors is not counted twice.

        Loader cleanup : Simplify FrameLoader/DocumentLoader setupForReplace()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49072

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        This patch contains one small known behavior change: multipart/x-mixed-replace main resources with text/html parts
        will no longer load the text/html progressively. In practice, loading the html progressively causes the document
        to get cleared as soon as the next part's data starts arriving, which leads to a blank page most of the time. This case
        seems to be pathological, as IE, FF, Opera and WebKit all do something different currently. This patch will cause
        us to behave like Firefox, which is the most sane of the current behaviors.

        a function on ecore main loop by avoiding dead lock or race condition.

        SVG radialGradient should support 'fr' for focal radius (just like Canvas)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97986

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        Update SVGRadialGradient to the changed behavior in SVG2: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html#RadialGradients
        SVG2 adds the focal radius for radial gradients. Color stops will start from the edge of
        the focal radius.
        The new specification does not limit the focal point to be inside the radial gradients radius.
        This makes SVGRadialGradient consistent with the radial gradient on Canvas.

        Clipboard::types() should return an ordered collection.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Let Clipboard::types() return a ListHashSet<String> instead of a HashSet<String> to make sure
        it retains the order in which type strings are added.

        No test, this fixes an issue that was uncovered when lowering the default table size of WTF
        hash tables, causing the HashSet<String> to rehash and reorder itself.

        [V8] toV8(Node*, ...) does more work than needed (6% faster on dom-traverse)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98567

        Reviewed by Kentaro Hara.

        This patch introduces toV8Fast for Node*. This function works a
        differently from the existing toV8 function in two ways:

        1) It uses the inline wrapper cache in Node to determine if we're
           executing in the main world. This is faster both in the case when
           isolated worlds exist because we don't need to retrieve any state
           for the current context.

        2) It doesn't attempt to inline the hash table lookup used to find the
           wrapper in the isolated world. There isn't a big need to inline this
           code since performance in the isolated world case is dominated by
           the hash table lookup.

        Because of these two changes, toV8Fast is small enough to inline into
        each attribute getter profitably. Over time, I would like to convert
        all the performance critical uses of toV8(Node*) to toV8Fast. At that
        point, we can delete toV8 and rename toV8Slow to toV8.

        Inline continuations create :after generated content on style recalcs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93170

        Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

        The bug is caused by RenderInline::styleDidChange's setContinuation(0).
        RenderObjectChildList uses continuation to know whether the given
        renderer should have AFTER render object or not.
        However, setContinuation(0) makes RenderObjectChildList to
        misunderstand that all continuations are last continuation.
        To avoid the misunderstanding, added a new flag to class
        RenderObejctChildList to enable/disable updating :after content (and
        also :before content).

        The setStyle invokes RenderInline::styleDidChange and also invokes
        updateBeforeAfterContent via the styleDidChange. This means,
        the last continuation's updateBeforeAfterContent is also invoked
        after setContinuation(0). We have to update :after for the last
        continuation.

        Don't assume that TileCache layers are opaque
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98555

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        TileCache previously set all its tile CALayers as opaque.
        However, we will need non-opaque tile caches when we use this
        tile cache for tiled layers, so add a member function to
        control tile opacity.
        
        RenderLayerBacking already calls m_graphicsLayer->setContentsOpaque()
        using the FrameView's notion of opaqueness, so this change will
        cause the main tile cache to be non-opaque if external forces have
        set the FrameView to be non-opaque.
        
        Also tweak the layer border widths on tiled layers.

        This is a regression from http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/119507.
        The problem is that contentHeight subtracts the scrollbar and
        RenderDeprecatedFlexbox subtracts the scrollbar.

        -Make it so that we only access override sizes if one has been set.
        I think this makes the calling code more clear.
        -If we don't have one set, grab the height/width - borderAndPadding.
        -Add a FIXME to change this all back to being borderbox sizes.
        There's something trick with making table padding/border work right for that

        when doing table layout.
        This made these symbols disappear from biggrid.html/redraw.html (dglazkov's spreadsheets benchmarks)
        as well as moved our robohornet/resizecol.html number from an average of 3221ms to 2608ms (~20%!).

        [GTK] Add support for creating EGL contexts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77921

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        This patch adds support for EGL, using OpenGL and OpenGL ES 2. Both
        options are set up on compile time, with the configure options
        --enable-egl and --enable-gles2.

        The implementation only adds support for EGL on top of X11, to
        isolate the changes to the minimum. More changes should come
        later to enable EGL for other targets (as Wayland).

        No new tests required, as existing WebGL and AC tests should cover
        the cases.

        Enforces a minimum row height for popup menus when a touch device is

        consolidated for touch and non-touch.  Based on user feedback, reverting
        to the old behavior for non-touch and only adding padding for touch
        devices seems like a much safer strategy.  This patch is not a direct
        revert of r127567 since the padding previously used for touch is a bit
        excessive.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98268

        Reviewed by Tor Arne Vestbø.

        Extracted QStyle/QWidget related code into a QWebStyle class that implements the QStyleFacade interface.

        QStyleFacade is a pure interface that lives in WebCore/platform/qt
        (next to RenderThemeQStyle and ScrollbarThemeQStyle) and provides a
        minimal interface of what we need to draw with QStyle as well as basic
        hit testing and metric retrieval. It also provides a
        QStyleFacadeOption class that aggregates common meta-data for
        rendering primitives, such as direction, rectangle, state (sunken,
        enabled, etc.) or palette. It also provides some more slider/scrollbar
        specific fields in a slider sub-structure.

        RenderThemeQStyle/ScrollbarThemeQStyle used to instantiate specific QStyleOption sub-classes and populate
        them with state information from render objects, before calling straight to QStyle. Most of the common code
        was encapsulated in StylePainterQStyle.

        The new RenderThemeQStyle/ScrolllbarThemeQStyle uses common code in
        StylePainterQStyle to populate state into QStyleFacadeOption before
        calling into QStyleFacade.

        The style facade is then implemented by QStyleFacadeImp, which extracts
        meta-data from QStyleFacadeOption arguments, populates style
        primitive specific QStyleOption objects and then calls on QStyle.

        RenderThemeQStyle/ScrollbarThemeQStyle can only use interface methods
        from QStyleFacade. QStyleFacadeImp on the other hand will live in the
        separate QtWebKitWidgets library in the future and therefore cannot use
        any WebCore types.

        Fix sub-field width to the maximum width of a placeholder and the maximum value
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98481

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        We can't assume a placeholder text is shorter than the width of
        digits. The placeholder string for the year field of
        input[type=week] is "----", but input[type=date] will have a
        localized string for it.

        We should set the 'width' CSS property to the maximum of the
        placeholder width and the maximum value width in order to prevent
        the field width from growing/narrowing.

        Before this patch, we secured four digits space for a year field,
        and allowed the field to grow its width when a larger year is
        set. After this patch, we don't allow it to grow because the
        'width' property is set to the maximum width.

        following tests are affected.

        We extract DOM traversal code from SelectorChecker so that we can use another traversal strategy.
        Another traversal strategy will be introduced in Bug 96990.

        SVGAttributeHashTranslator does not need to copy QualifiedName in the common case

        I tested this using instruments on a test case which modified SVG attributes in a loop.
        I believe pdr has some perf-tests in this area, but they weren't needed here.  A simple sample showed this as a huge win,

        Selector specificity categories "overflow" into higher categories

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        This patch adds per-component overflow guards for CSS selector specificity.
        Previously, we didn't guard against overflow. 
        Since we stored each component as a byte mapped into a single unsigned int for the whole specificity,
        256 of a particular simple selector was equivalent to 1 of the next-higher-group selector.
        This violated the Selectors specification,
        which requires the components to be compared lexicographically.

        Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

        There is a concept of demotion for a <form> contained in a table. A <form> is demoted if its immediate parent
        is either a <table>, table sections (tbody, etc) or a table row (tr). A renderer for such a <form> is created only
        if its display is one of the table display types (TABLE, INLINE_TABLE, TABLE_FOOTER_GROUP, etc).
        However when a <table> containing a demoted <form> is cloned, the <form> does not retain its demotion state and 
        results in the table getting improperly rendered.

          For HTMLFormElement node the member variable can be classified into five groups based on the 
          information they hold:
            1) Variables containing information regarding <form> subtree and elements associated with it.
               These get updated as and when an element is added to the <form> subtree.
            2) Variables containing <form> submit state information.
            3) Flag to hold information if reset() has been called.
            4) Flag(m_wasDemoted) that indicates whether the form is demoted or not, based on which it needs to
               be handled differently during creation of its renderer.
               This information is currently being updated only during the HTML tree construction phase.
            5) Flag(m_wasMalformed) to hold information if the <form> is malformed or not.

          Variables of group (1) will be updated as and when elements are added to the <form> subtree. Whereas,
          (2) and (3) hold instance specific information, thus copying them is not required. Also (5) is currently not
          being used(not set by any code).

        Attribute and Uniform variable names need translation in shader
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70989

        Reviewed by Tim Horton (and Darin Adler).

        WebGL specifies some maximum lengths for variable names (attributes
        and uniforms). Also, some GL drivers have issues with long names. For
        that reason, ANGLE has an option to rewrite the shader, translating
        long names into short names. Turning this on helps shaders compile,
        but we need to keep a mapping between the original names and the
        translated names, so that we bind to the right location from user code
        (which won't ever see the translated source).

        This provided an opportunity to clean up some other bits of code:
        CSS Filters examined the uniform names after a compilation; It can
        now use the variable name map. I also added a typedef for the
        HashMaps that keep the shader, the source code and the variable name
        mappings.

        I also opened a followup bug to make sure these tables are deleted

        [skia] Drawing a subrect of bitmap image is misaligned
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95121

        Reviewed by Stephen White.

        When drawing a subrect of BitmapImage and the subrect is not aligned
        to integer boundaries, skia expands it to the closest enclosing integer
        rectangle. This creates prominent rendering artifacts when an image
        is used as background and its sub-regions are invalidated frequently.

        This patch fixes the problem by doing alignment to integer boundaries
        and clipping for both cases of RESAMPLE_AWESOME and RESAMPLE_LINEAR.

        A clip rect is applied to the canvas using original destination
        rectangle, while source and destination rectangles are enlarged
        appropriately to ensure source rectangle is aligned.

        This patch also fixes a closely related problem. In RESAMPLE_AWESOME
        resampling mode the previous algorithm applies different approximated
        scale factor for each scaled image fragment. This caused the stitched
        image to look ugly.

        Scale factor is approximated using entire image size, this gives a
        more accurate approximation because of greater denominator and a
        consistent scale factor across all fragments.

        Changes in Skia enable caching of the scaled image and return the
        scaled fragment because scale factor is now consistent for all
        fragments.

        ReplaceSelectionCommand should merge text nodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98188

        Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

        Added mergeTextNodesAroundPosition to ReplaceSelectionCommand to merge text nodes after the replace in
        completeHTMLReplacement. Also fixed a bunch of bugs in other classes and functions to make this work.

        This behavior change is tested by existing tests.

        (WebCore::InsertParagraphSeparatorCommand::doApply): When splitting a text node, place the insertionPosition
        at the end of the first half. Leaving it at the beginning of the second half confuses the rest of the code in
        the function. However, the logic to handle the "insignificant" white spaces needs the position at the start of
        the second half. So keep this position.
        * editing/ReplaceSelectionCommand.cpp:
        (WebCore::ReplaceSelectionCommand::doApply): Update visibleStart after inserting a paragraph separator so that
        the logic to cleanup the nested div checks the right condition (right beneath it starting with a long comment).
        (WebCore::ReplaceSelectionCommand::addSpacesForSmartReplace): Insert a space for smart paste at the appropriate
        offset instead of at the end of endNode. Also update the layout before obtaining startDownstream as we may have 
        modified the DOM by inserting a space for endNode. Finally, a non-breaking space should be treated like a space
        isCharacterSmartReplaceExempt for the purpose of smart replace. e.g. if we're inserting "world" after
        "hello&nbsp;", we shouldn't be inserting another space between "hello" and "world".

        Fixed position visibility check does not consider descendants

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The check against creating composition layers for invisible fixed positioned
        elements is too aggressive in that it does not consider descendants of the
        fixed positioned element that may be visible even though the element itself is
        out of view.

        Fix the problem by calculating the true composited bounds of the fixed
        element instead of just using the size of the fixed layer. Because calculating
        the true bounds may be expensive, it is only done if the fixed layer itself is
        invisible.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98227

        Reviewed by Hajime Morita.

        Before this patch, we always set 1 to the minimum limit and 275760 to
        the maximum limit for a year field, and a user can specify any year
        regardless of min/max attributes. Such wide range is unnecessary for
        normal applications and we should provide a way to limit the range.

        Test: fast/forms/month-multiple-fields/month-multiple-fields-keyboard-events.html

        * html/shadow/DateTimeFieldElements.h:
        To add four constructor arguments, introduce Parameters struct.
        Actually, we add the followings;
         - minimum year in UI
         - maximum year in UI
         - min attribute is specified
         - max attribute is specified

        (WebCore::DateTimeYearFieldElement::defaultValueForStepDown):

         - the field has the current year if the max attribute is not specified.
         - the field has the maximum value otherwise.

        [soup] WebKit crashes when doing a http request
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98055

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        On i386, (d->m_firstRequest.timeoutInterval() * 1000) results in 0 if
        timeoutInterval() is INT_MAX. So, set default timeout to 0 to avoid
        calling soup_add_timeout with a 0 value.

        Also, if resource handle is deleted before "request-started" signal is
        emitted, soupMessage handle points to a deleted object, and a crash
        occurs. So, reset soupMessage handle data in
        cleanupSoupRequestOperation so it won't happen anymore.

        Lastly, if timeout occurs before request is completed, handle is
        deleted, and crash occurs in sendRequestCallback due to an early
        destroyed handle. To avoid that, call handle->cancel in
        requestTimeoutCallback. There is no need to call
        cleanupSoupRequestOperation anymore since handle->cancel will trigger
        sendRequestCallback, and as handle is deleted,
        cleanupSoupRequestOperation will be called automatically.

        No new tests yet, tests will be added with the patch in bug 74802.

        [Sub-pixel layout] incorrect rendering when painting sub-layers as their own root
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97484

        Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

        When in compositing mode, layer painting can be triggered through the backing store. When this
        happens, a non-top-level RenderLayer is called to paint as its own root. Normally, we attempt to preserve
        the proper sub-pixel accumulation through layers to their children, but since we're not
        starting with the top-level layer, we haven't properly accumulated one, and convertToLayerCoords,
        another source of correctly getting the sub-pixel offset for a layer, also avoids crawling
        past the listed root layer.

        When painting a root layer, we're aligned to the surface we're painting to, so we round our
        offset to avoid moving objects around.

        Move the handling of custom font pruning from Document to FontFallbackList.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This patch gets rid of the separate Structure allocator in the MarkedSpace and adds two new destructor-only
        allocators. We now have separate allocators for our three types of objects: those objects with no destructors,
        those objects with destructors and with immortal structures, and those objects with destructors that don't have 
        immortal structures. All of the objects of the third type (destructors without immortal structures) now 
        inherit from a new class named JSDestructibleObject (which in turn is a subclass of JSNonFinalObject), which stores 
        the ClassInfo for these classes at a fixed offset for safe retrieval during sweeping/destruction.

        Optimize string encoding/decoding, which showed up as a CPU hot spot during profiling.
        The backing store uses big-endian ordering of 16-bit code unit strings, so a memcopy
        isn't sufficient, but the code used StringBuilder::append() character-by-character
        and custom byte-swapping which was slow.

        Ran a test w/ DumpRenderTree (to avoid multiprocess overhead) taking a 10k character string
        and putting it 20k times and getting it 20k times. On my test box, mean time before the
