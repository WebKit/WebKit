        [CSS Shapes] Improve the performance of image valued shapes with large shape-margins
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122613

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The cost of computing the shape-margin boundary of an image-valued shape-outside
        is now proportional to (2 * shape-margin + image.height) rather than
        (2 * shape-margin * image.height). The performance improvement comes from skipping
        sequences of rounded-rectangle intervals that will not contribute to the final
        result. Each non-empty row in the original image contributes one rounded-rectangle
        whose corner radius is shape-margin, height is 2 * shape-margin, and width is
        2 * shape-margin plus the width of the limits of the intervals on the row.

        Renamed private method RasterShape::getIntervals() to intervalsAt() to be a little
        more consistent with WebKit naming conventions.

        There are no new tests since is just an internal refactoring.

        [CSS Regions] Anonymous nested regions

        Tests: fast/regions/table-caption-as-region.html
               fast/regions/table-cell-as-region.html

        This patch allows any non-replaced block to behave like a region. When an element is styled with the
        -webkit-flow-from property, instead of making the renderer a RenderRegion, we let the original
        renderer be created the same way and we add a region as an anonymous child for the renderer.
        The anonymous block child, modeled by the new RenderNamedFlowFragment class, will be responsible
        for the fragmentation of the named flow thread content.

        A RenderBlockFlow object will keep a reference to a RenderNamedFlowFragment(RenderRegion) inside its
        rare data structures.

        Fix the build after r157478.

        Rubber-stamped by Tim Horton.

        Due to the way WebCore.exp.in is used, it can't be used to export a differing set of symbols
        for different architectures. We often work around this by tweaking code slightly to avoid
        needing to export different symbols. However, in this case the symbol name itself encodes an
        architecture-specific detail and there's no clear way to avoid the requirement to export it.

        To deal with this case we turn to ld's support for wildcards in the symbol export list.

        * WebCore.exp.in: Use wildcards in place of the number that represents by how much "this"
        should be adjusted when calling through the vtable thunk. Also sort the remainder of the file.
        * make-export-file-generator: Don't attempt to verify symbol names that contain wildcard characters.

        Instead of traversing through EventPath for each TouchList, traverse through TouchList for every EventContext.

        Fix modification of whitespace endpoints to not assume it's operating on RenderTexts

        During line layout, we use midpoints to identify RenderObjects, or parts of
        RenderObjects, that don't need InlineBoxes, usually because of collapsed whitespace.

        Prior to actually creating BidiRuns (the precursor to InlineBoxes), we use
        checkMidpoints to fix up our lineMidpointState to handle the case where we start
        ignoring spaces in our line, but don't stop until somewhere on the following line.
        Previously, this function assumed that the final midpoint (called an endpoint)
        was a RenderText, but this assumption is wrong if we have a beginning midpoint
        created by shouldSkipWhitespaceAfterStartObject (which handles inlines and list
        markers) and no endpoint on that line. In that case, we'd instead adjust the
        position backwards on the beginning midpoint, which would cause us to fail to
        create an InlineBox for the inline or list marker. In the new test added, this
        would actually trigger a crash due to an assumption when visually re-ordering
        BidiRuns that a non-empty line would actually contain at least one such run.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122742

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        This is a follow-up to r157219 which introduced a workaround for the GCC's quirky behavior that
        was resulting in crashes due to the PassRefPtr<Event> object passed to EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent
        being copied and nullified first before retrieving the EventTarget of the Event object wrapped in that
        PassRefPtr.

        The implementation is now adjusted to first retrieve the pointer to the Event's EventTarget and store
        it in a local variable. That variable is then passed as the first parameter to EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent,
        and the PassRefPtr<Event> passed directly as the second parameter. Previously the pointer of that PassRefPtr
        object was passed in, with a new PassRefPtr being created which would increase the reference count of the
        ref-counted object. Passing in the original PassRefPtr avoids the unnecessary reference count increase by creating
        a copy. That still nullifies the original PassRefPtr, but that's not a problem anymore.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Implement support for <flex>
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115362

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        From Blink r149134, r149480, r149532, r150287 and r156127 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>
        From Blink r157820 by <svillar@igalia.com>

        Added support for flexible lengths ('fr' unit) in CSS Grid Layout
        code. This requires the addition of GridLength class to
        encapsulate the knowledge of <flex> to the grid layout code.

        Also updated the algorithm that computes the layout. It increases
        the value of 1fr based on the grid tracks' usedBreath to fraction
        ratio (called normalizedFractionValue). This enables increasing
        the fraction value while updating the available space to account
        for processed grid tracks. The algorithm stops when we run out of
        grid tracks or available space (one grid item has an intrinsic
        size too big). This matches the specs to the letter for the known
        available space case (both the unknown case and the interaction
        with 'span' are left out of this patch).

        When deciding whether a line is considered empty, we need to check if the current

        <span></span><span>abcd</span> from <span>a</span><span>bcd</span>, where in the first
        case when we hit the second <span> the line is still considered empty, as opposed to the
