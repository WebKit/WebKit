        When creating a PlatformDisplay from a shared GdkDisplay, we need to keep a reference to the display and connect
        to closed signal to release our display dependent resources. Closed signal is emitted right before the native
        display is actually closed by GDK. We also need to make sure that the sharing GL context is released before the
        PlatformDisplay is destroyed. This is always happening for EGL because the sharing GL context is cleared before
        terminating the EGL display in the atexit handler, but that's not the case of GLX. Since X11 only allows one
        PlatformDisplay, which is always the shared one, we can just install an atexit handler in the constructor to
        clear the sharing context before the destructor is called.

        Video frames were incorrectly evicted during a call to appendBuffer
        as the Source Buffer incorrectly assumed a discontinuity was present.

        When appending data to a source buffer, the MSE specs describe a method
        to detect discontinuities in the Coded Frame Processing algorithm
        (https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/#sourcebuffer-coded-frame-processing)
        step 6:
        "
        - If last decode timestamp for track buffer is set and decode timestamp
          is less than last decode timestamp:
        OR
        - If last decode timestamp for track buffer is set and the difference
          between decode timestamp and last decode timestamp is greater than
          2 times last frame duration.
        "
        The issue being what defines the last frame duration.
        Is it the frame last seen in the coded frame processing loop or the frame
        whose presentation timestamp is just before the one we are currently
        processing.

        H264 and HEVC have a concept of b-frames: that is a frame that depends
        on a future frame to be decoded.
        Those frames are found in the container and can be identified by their
        presentation timestamp higher than the frame following in decode order.
        Those present a challenge as the frame prior the current one in
        presentation order, may actually only be found several frames back in
        decode order.
        Bug 181891 attempted to fix a similar issue, and used the longest
        "decode duration" as a workaround to detect discontinuity in the content.
        It mentioned adopting the same technique as in Mozilla's MSE
        implementation, but Mozilla also skip discontinuity detection within a
        media segment (https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/#media-segment which for
        fMP4 is a single moof box) an approach that can't be achieved with
        CoreMedia's AVStreamDataParser.
        As mentioned in bug 181891, CoreMedia ignore the decode timestamps' delta
        and juggles with the sample's duration so that there's no discontinuity
        in the demuxed samples' presentation time, causing false positive in the
        gap detection algorithm.

        Bilibili uses HEVC content, and uses an encoding that generate lots
        of b-frames, with a very wide sliding window (seen up to 12 frames).
        By using the longest frame duration found in either presentation or
        decode duration as threshold to identify a discontinuity, we can
        properly parse the content and not incorrectly evict appended frames.
        (As a side note, the use of HEVC with B-Frames is peculiar as not all
        hardware support it.)
        It is difficult to identify here if the issue is within the bilibili's
        content or CoreMedia's output, though the responsibility more than
        likely lies with bilibili.

        Make input element UA shadow tree creation lazy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236747

        Reviewed by Aditya Keerthi.

        We currently delay InputType creation for parser inserted elements until
        just after the attributes have been set, so that we don't wastefully
        create an InputType and the UA shadow tree creation if a non-text
        type="" was specified on the tag. We don't do anything similar for
        script inserted input elements. We could make the InputType creation
        lazy, but most of the wasted time is due to the shadow tree creation.

        This patch makes InputType shadow tree creation lazy by delaying it
        until one of the following happens:

        1. the element is inserted into the document
        2. the type="" or value="" attributes are changed before the element
           is inserted into the document
        3. any DOM methods that need access to the innerTextElement() are
           called on the element before the element is inserted into the
           document

        Not all places where we call innerTextElement() on the
        HTMLInputElement are safe to lazily create the shadow trees, so we
        have two accessors:

        - innerTextElement() returns the inner text element if it's been
          created already
        - innerTextElementCreatingShadowSubtreeIfNeeded will perform the lazy
          shadow tree construction if it hasn't already been done

        Since the existing
        createShadowSubtreeAndUpdateInnerTextElementEditability function has
        more responsibility than just creating the subtree and ensuring the
        editability is set appropriately, it's renamed to a more manageable
        createShadowSubtree.

        This change is a 0.5% progression on Speedometer 2.

        Make input element UA shadow tree creation lazy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236747

        Reviewed by Aditya Keerthi.

        We currently delay InputType creation for parser inserted elements until
        just after the attributes have been set, so that we don't wastefully
        create an InputType and the UA shadow tree creation if a non-text
        type="" was specified on the tag. We don't do anything similar for
        script inserted input elements. We could make the InputType creation
        lazy, but most of the wasted time is due to the shadow tree creation.

        This patch makes InputType shadow tree creation lazy by delaying it
        until one of the following happens:

        1. the element is inserted into the document
        2. the type="" or value="" attributes are changed before the element
           is inserted into the document
        3. any DOM methods that need access to the innerTextElement() are
           called on the element before the element is inserted into the
           document

        Not all places where we call innerTextElement() on the
        HTMLInputElement are safe to lazily create the shadow trees, so we
        have two accessors:

        - innerTextElement() returns the inner text element if it's been
          created already
        - innerTextElementCreatingShadowSubtreeIfNeeded will perform the lazy
          shadow tree construction if it hasn't already been done

        Since the existing
        createShadowSubtreeAndUpdateInnerTextElementEditability function has
        more responsibility than just creating the subtree and ensuring the
        editability is set appropriately, it's renamed to a more manageable
        createShadowSubtree.

        This change is a 0.5% progression on Speedometer 2.
