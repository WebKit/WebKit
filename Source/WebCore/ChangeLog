        The "find the node under the finger" heuristic should only find nodes that are visible to hit-testing.

        When the user taps on the screen, we run a "find the best node under the finger" heuristic and use the node's location
        to dispatch the associated event (e.g. mousePressed).
        Ideally the "best node under the finger" and the final target node for the associated event are the same.
        However these two methods configure the hit-testing process differently which could lead to node mismatch.
        The "best node" heuristic calls hit-testing with AllowChildFrameContent. This flag allows hit-testing to descend into
        subframes even if the subframe is not visible to hit-testing (visibility: hidden).
        While event dispatching never descends into subfames through hit-testing, but instead it forwards the dispatching to subframes that are visible to hit-testing.

        This patch addresses the mismatching node issue by calling the descending version of hit-testing with a flag that enforces visiblity check before descending into a subframe.

        [GStreamer] Mock GStreamer realtime sources should keep a Ref of their mock realtime media sources
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194326

        WrappedMockRealtimeVideoSource is a subclass of RealtimeMediaSource which is refcounted, we can't

        Also changed m_wrappedSource type to its actual type so it is cleaner even if needed
        to upcast it to RealtimeMediaSource so some method that are made private in the mock

        Drop non thread-safe usage of WeakPtr in PlaybackSessionInterfaceAVKit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199698

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        The PlaybackSessionInterfaceAVKit constructor was making a weakPtr on the UI Thread
        of an WebThread object. The WeakPtr would then be used as a data member throughout
        the class on the UIThread. This is not thread-safe.

        This patch switches to using a raw pointer instead of a WeakPtr. This is a partial
        rollout of r243337, which turned the raw pointer into a WeakPtr for hardening
        purposes. For extra safety, this patch updates the VideoFullscreenControllerContext
        so that it notifies its clients (i.e. PlaybackSessionInterfaceAVKit) that it is
        getting destroyed, so that they can null-out their m_playbackSessionModel data
        member. This gives the sames guarantees than WeakPtr but in a thread-safe way.

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        Various code paths for editing used renderer->absoluteBoundingBoxRect(), which is the border
        box of the element (or a set of line boxes for inline elements) converted to absolute

        place the caret in overflow content, and allow selection rects to be in the overflow area
        (if the element has visible overflow).

        Try to clean this up by adding some static helpers on WebPage for accessing the relevant
        rects, and use them in code call from visiblePositionInFocusedNodeForPoint(), and
        code that is input to selectionClipRect.

        ATK_ROLE_CONTENT_DELETION respectively. Also expose "insertion" and "deletion" via
        the AtkObject xml-roles attribute so that this information is not completely absent
        for GTK or WPE built against earlier versions of ATK.

        Remove AccessibilityObject's isSubscriptStyleGroup() and isSuperscriptStyleGroup().
        These two methods were only being used by ATK and are no longer needed for platform

        I fix it by using two different hash sets, tracking which functions we have started visiting, and which we have finished visiting.
        The difference are those that are currently "on the stack", and calling any of those is an error.
        As a bonus, I also overrode visit(Program&), so that we only bother visiting function definitions.

        On whlsl-compute.html ran 5 times, this patch reduces the time spent in the recursion checker from 26ms to 12ms.
        It is likely to be a much bigger win on larger programs (since it took the complexity from quadratic to linear).

        The basic idea is to go from having each AST node contain its own token to having each AST node contain a pair of offsets into the source,
        the offset before its start and the offset after its end. This will let us get good error messages.
        As a bonus, it saves a bit of memory as Tokens are larger (one extra word for their type).

        The new CodeLocation class is put in Lexer.h, because it has a cyclic dependency on Token, which also has a cyclic dependency on Lexer.

        [iOS] REGRESSION(r244851): Revealing caret sometimes fails when content inset is used
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199662

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The bug was caused by ScrollableArea::maximumScrollPosition using ScrollableArea::visibleSize, which does not
        take the content insets into account correctly, rather than FrameView::visualViewportRectExpandedByContentInsets,
        which does, and is used for "viewRect" in RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible.

        Override the maximum scroll position using visualViewportRectExpandedByContentInsets in iOS to fix the issue.

        [WHLSL] Track code locations correctly throughout the compiler to get good error messages
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199675

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        The basic idea is to go from having each AST node contain its own token to having each AST node contain a pair of offsets into the source,
        the offset before its start and the offset after its end. This will let us get good error messages.
        As a bonus, it saves a bit of memory as Tokens are larger (one extra word for their type).

        The new CodeLocation class is put in Lexer.h, because it has a cyclic dependency on Token, which also has a cyclic dependency on Lexer.

        No new tests as there is no intended functional change.

        Hook up WebGL's back buffer in ANGLE backend on macOS
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198982

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        Fix a few places which were accidentally calling desktop OpenGL rather
        than ANGLE. Fix some calls which were using ANGLE's OpenGL ES 3.0
        entry points rather than the OpenGL ES 2.0 extension APIs, causing
        them to generate errors in WebGL 1.0's backend. Change
        Extensions3DANGLE to use ANGLE's requestable extension mechanism.

        Fix framebuffer setup when using ANGLE for WebGL 1.0 contexts, for
        both antialias:true and false.

        Remove ANGLEWebKitBridge in ANGLE backend. It interfered with the
        correct operation of ANGLE's internal shader compiler, and was
        unnecessary given the use of ANGLE. Remove all manual shader name
        hashing and mapping in ANGLE backend.

        Tested with parts of the WebGL conformance suite and the San
        Angeles demo, which now runs properly with WebKit's ANGLE backend
        for WebGL.

        Fix unsafe usage of makeWeakPtr() in CMTimebaseEffectiveRateChangedCallback()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199656

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        CMTimebaseEffectiveRateChangedCallback() is getting called on a background thread and would call
        makeWeakPtr() on the MediaPlayerPrivateMediaSourceAVFObjC object, which is not safe because
        MediaPlayerPrivateMediaSourceAVFObjC is a main thread object.

        To address the issue, move the logic for listening to effective rate changes to its own
        Listener class which is ThreadSafeRefCounted. Instead of using makeWeakPtr() on the background
        thread, we now merely ref the thread-safe listener.

        Web Inspector: Canvas: replace WTF::Vector with std::initializer_list in CallTracer to avoid dynamic allocations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199611

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        The number of arguments for each member function is known at build time, so there's no need
        to dynamically allocate a `WTF::Vector` when capturing the arguments. One downside to using
        a `std::initializer_list` is that we can no longer "flatten" `WTF::Variant` arguments into
        a `RecordCanvasActionVariant`, but this is acceptable because `WTF::Variant` supports having
        yet another `WTF::Variant` as one of it's types, which the `InspectorCanvas` can then figure
        out when it finally gets the data. The same applies to `nullptr`/`Optional` checks as well.

        Reviewed by Frédéric Wang and Simon Fraser.

        To determine which physical side to align we need to transform ScrollIntoViewOptions to scrollAlignment.
        We'll translate the inline and block direction separately. The writing-mode will affect the block scrollAlignment.
        While both writing-mode and CSS direction will affect the inline scrollAlignment. The argument for scrollRectToVisible
        should be physical, so if !isHorizontalWritingMode(), we need to switch alignX and alignY.

        For direction: rtl and writing-mode: horizontal-tb box, WebKit puts the scrollbar on the left side. The visible rect
        starts from the right side of the scroll bar, so localExposeRect should also start from the right side of
        scroll bar.

        <rdar://problem/43615497>

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        When pasting into Microsoft Excel 365, the copied data is all inserted into a single cell, even when copying a
        table. To understand why this happens, we first need to understand how Excel's logic for handling paste works.
        When tapping on the "Paste" button, Excel performs and expects the following:

        1.  Before triggering programmatic paste, move focus into a hidden contenteditable area specifically intended to
            capture pasted content.
        2.  Run a promise that resolves immediately; the promise callback restores focus to the originally focused
            element prior to (1).
        3.  Invoke programmatic paste using `document.execCommand("Paste")`.
        4.  The callback scheduled in step (2) then runs, restoring focus to the main editable element representing a
            table cell.

        However, what ends up happening is this:

        Steps (1)-(3): same as before.
        4.  We (WebKit) create a temporary Page for the purposes of sanitizing copied web content before exposing it to
            the paste handler. This involves creating and loading a document; when this is finished, we call into
            Document::finishedParsing which flushes the microtask queue.
        5.  This causes us to immediately run the microtask enqueued in step (2), which restores focus to the previously
            focused element (importantly, this is not the element that was focused in step (1)).
        6.  The paste commences, and inserts the sanitized fragment into the originally focused element rather than the
            content editable area intended to capture pasted content.

        Excel's script then gets confused, and does not end up using their special paste logic to handle the paste. The
        pasted content is instead just inserted as plain text in a cell. To address this, we simply prevent document
        load in the Page for web content sanitization from triggering a microtask checkpoint; this allows any scheduled
        main thread microtasks to be deferred until the next turn of the runloop.

        Don't immediately dispatch microtasks when we finish document parsing, in the case where the page is intended

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199551

        Relatively positioned (inflow) inline container lives in the formatting context where its parent lives unless
        the parent establishes a formatting context. This is slightly different from the usual behavior which is containing block driven.

        div id=outer style="position: absolute">><div id=inner><span style="position: relative">content</span></div></div>

        While the relatively positioned inline container (span) is placed relative to its containing block "outer", it lives in the inline formatting context established by "inner".

        results in a long hang under OverlapMapContainer::append(). We were creating pathological clipping scopes with
        thousands of entries, because OverlapMapContainer::mergeClippingScopesRecursive() had a logic error where
        it added 'sourceScope' to the child instead of 'sourceChildScope'. Add a new assertion to detect that case.
        
        I wasn't able to create a testcase that caused a hang, but a number of existing tests would have
        hit the assertion.

        Nothing is ever deleted from it, and all of its contents are eventually copied into the expressions.

        Revert change to block playback when process is ostensibly "suspended".
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199530

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        In r243958, a drive-by-fix was added that blocked playback when the WebProcess thought it
        was susposed to be suspended. The intent was to keep the AVAudioSession for the process
        from being activated just before the process was suspended, and thus avoid receiving an
        "interruption" and having the AVAudioSession deactivated out from under us upon resuming.

        Unfortunately, this caused problems when another process resumes the WebContent process
        in order to start playback; namely the Now Playing UI's play button. Because we may receive
        the play command long before whe notice that we've been resumed, the WebContent process
        may refuse to honor the play command because it thinks its supposed to be suspended.

        [WHLSL] Standard library is too big to directly include in WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198186
        <rdar://problem/51288898>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch adds almost the entire remainder of the standard library. There are a few
        pieces missing:
        - step() because of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199289
        - sign() also because of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199289
        - faceforward() because it calls sign()
        - Some of the more rarely-used texturing functions (e.g. Gather()) https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195813
        - RWTextures https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198985

        There were two problems with adding so many standard library functions:
        - We didn't want to increase the WebCore binary size that much
        - Compiling all the functions at runtime took 7 seconds, which is much too long

        This patch addresses the first problem by gzipping the standard library before including it in the binary.
        At runtime, we use libcompression to unzip it.

        To address the second problem, we did some analysis and found that 14% of that 7 seconds was simply
        destroying all the AST nodes. Even if we eliminated all processing of the AST, simply having the AST
        of the entire standard library built and destroyed would still be too slow. Therefore, this patch limits
        which parts of the standard library get parsed in the first place. All the functions in the standard library
        file are sorted by name, and each group of functions with the same name are preceeded by a comment of the
        form /* Functions named xyz */. At build time, a Python script looks for all these comments, and builds a
        map from function name to character offset inside the file where those functions begin. At run time, we
        parse the user program first, look for all function calls within it, and look up those function call names
        in the map to see which part of the standard library holds those functions. We then parse just that part.
        Because the standard library can call other functions in the standard library, we do this in a loop until
        we have exhausted all the functions.

        [WHLSL] Optimize the lexer

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        This patch includes a number of small optimizations to the lexer:
        - By creating two new types of Token (Invalid and EOF), we can avoid having to manipulate Optional<Token> everywhere
        - By combining the lexing of identifiers, keywords and operator names, we can avoid re-reading them several times
        - By storing mere offsets in the tokens instead of string views, we save space in the common case where the string view is unused (e.g. for keywords)
        - By storing mere offsets in the tokens instead of line numbers, we can simplify the whitespace and comment lexing; and we can easily recompute the line number on demand
        - By using templates we can avoid constructing and destructing vectors at runtime every time we call tryTypes, consumeTypes or peekTypes; as well as avoiding a call to find().
        - I also hoisted the length check out of the loop in Lexer::string()
        All of this combined brought the time spent in the parser when running LayoutTests/webgpu/whlsl-test-harness-test.html 5 times on my machine from 612ms to 462ms.

        I also removed the 'anyCharacter' method since it was dead code.
        I also removed Lexer::position(), but it is directly equivalent now to peek().startOffset.

        No new tests as there is no intended functional change.

        This pass only stores into each property access and call expression vectors of all the functions it might be calling, for use by the Checker afterwards.
        But the checker is perfectly able to compute a pointer to these vectors by itself.
        So by removing this pass, we gain the following:
        - One less pass over the AST
        - No need to copy these vectors (which can be large for heavily overloaded functions, of which there are quite a few in the stdlib)
        - No need to have these vectors in the expressions, saving 24 bytes per CallExpression and 72 bytes per PropertyAccessExpression
        - No need to allocate and then destroy these vectors.

        [Pointer Events] Respect pointer capture when dispatching mouse boundary events and updating :hover
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198999
        <rdar://problem/51979477>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Up until now, we would not account for pointer capture (see ​https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#pointer-capture) when dispatching
        mouse boundary events (mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave) and their counterpart pointer events. We would also not account
        for it when updating :hover styles.

        Now, when pointer capture changes for an element, we call setCapturingMouseEventsElement() on the EventHandler such that the element
        that would naturally hit-test is overridden by the pointer capture element when identifying which target to use for the dispatch of
        boundary mouse events. Additionally, when calling Document::prepareMouseEvent(), we also use the pointer capture element to
        pass down to Document::updateHoverActiveState() such that :hover styles are applied to the correct element.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::prepareMouseEvent): When a new event is going to be dispatched, we must run the Process Pending Capture Element
        steps as mandated by the Pointer Events spec. Calling this will dispatch the appropriate pointer capture change events and also
        required boundary events since EventHandler::setCapturingMouseEventsElement() calls into EventHandler::updateMouseEventTargetNode().
        Since this may update the capturing mouse events element, we ensure that we call updateHoverActiveState() with a flag that indicates that.
        Finally, we use the capturing mouse events element instead of the hit-testing element to pass to updateHoverActiveState() to ensure
        that is has :hover styles applied.
        (WebCore::Document::updateHoverActiveState): Account for the new CaptureChange flag to force the invalidation of the :hover and :active
        elements chain at all times when the capturing mouse events element changed.
        * dom/Document.h:
        * dom/PointerEvent.h: Update PointerEvent::createForPointerCapture() to take specific parameters rather than a single PointerEvent to
        set the pointerId, isPrimary and pointerType properties of the generated event. This is required to call processPendingPointerCapture()
        outside of PointerEvent dispatch logic since we now call it from Document::prepareMouseEvent() where we haven't yet generated such an
        event.
        * page/EventHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::pointerCaptureElementDidChange): When a new pointer capture element is set, call updateMouseEventTargetNode()
        to ensure that boundary events are fired to indicate the pointer capture state change.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::prepareMouseEvent): Keep track of the last PlatformMouseEvent used to prepare a mouse event so that we can use
        it when setCapturingMouseEventsElement() is called.
        * page/EventHandler.h:
        * page/PointerCaptureController.cpp:
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::pointerCaptureElement): Since Document::prepareMouseEvent() needs to know the current pointer capture
        element, add a new public method that indicates the pointer capture element if that element is contained in the provided document. We need
        to provide the document since PointerCaptureController is owned by the Page and may manage several documents.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEvent): Only run the Process Pending Capture Element steps when dealing with a touch or pen
        event since those steps are already ran for mouse events in Document::prepareMouseEvent(). Additionally, since the element target is already
        set to be the pointer capture element with the changes made to processPendingPointerCapture(), and because on iOS pointer capture is always
        active, we can remove the code that would retarget the event to the pointer capture element.

        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::cancelPointer):
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::processPendingPointerCapture): We now call into EventHandler::setCapturingMouseEventsElement() when the
        capture target element changes. We must be careful to call this method prior to dispatching the "gotpointercapture" event and after dispatching
        the "lostpointercapture" event so that boundary events are fired at the right time.

        Certain compositing tree updates could leave a layer with a ScrollingProxy role, but having an
        AncestorClippingStack with no overflow scrolling layers - for example, a related scroller could become
        scrollable, but we failed to mark the layer with the ancestor clippings stack as needing a geometry update.

        When this happened updateScrollingNodeForScrollingProxyRole() would return 0, causing the next child to be
        inserted with a parent of 0 (which should only happen for the root), and triggering a release assert in
        ScrollingStateTree::insertNode().

        Fix by ensuring that updateScrollingNodeForScrollingProxyRole() always returns the existing parentNodeID if we
        don't have a new node to insert.

        This pass only stores into each property access and call expression vectors of all the functions it might be calling, for use by the Checker afterwards.
        But the checker is perfectly able to compute a pointer to these vectors by itself.
        So by removing this pass, we gain the following:
        - One less pass over the AST
        - No need to copy these vectors (which can be large for heavily overloaded functions, of which there are quite a few in the stdlib)
        - No need to have these vectors in the expressions, saving 24 bytes per CallExpression and 72 bytes per PropertyAccessExpression
        - No need to allocate and then destroy these vectors.

        [WHLSL] Standard library is too big to directly include in WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198186
        <rdar://problem/51288898>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch adds almost the entire remainder of the standard library. There are a few
        pieces missing:
        - step() because of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199289
        - sign() also because of https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199289
        - faceforward() because it calls sign()
        - Some of the more rarely-used texturing functions (e.g. Gather()) https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195813
        - RWTextures https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198985

        There were two problems with adding so many standard library functions:
        - We didn't want to increase the WebCore binary size that much
        - Compiling all the functions at runtime took 7 seconds, which is much too long

        This patch addresses the first problem by gzipping the standard library before including it in the binary.
        At runtime, we use libcompression to unzip it.

        To address the second problem, we did some analysis and found that 14% of that 7 seconds was simply
        destroying all the AST nodes. Even if we eliminated all processing of the AST, simply having the AST
        of the entire standard library built and destroyed would still be too slow. Therefore, this patch limits
        which parts of the standard library get parsed in the first place. All the functions in the standard library
        file are sorted by name, and each group of functions with the same name are preceeded by a comment of the
        form /* Functions named xyz */. At build time, a Python script looks for all these comments, and builds a
        map from function name to character offset inside the file where those functions begin. At run time, we
        parse the user program first, look for all function calls within it, and look up those function call names
        in the map to see which part of the standard library holds those functions. We then parse just that part.
        Because the standard library can call other functions in the standard library, we do this in a loop until
        we have exhausted all the functions.

        [WHLSL] "Semantic" should be held by a unique_ptr, not an Optional
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199462

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

        Most StructureElement, FunctionDeclaration and (especially) VariableDeclaration don't have a 'Semantic' field.
        Using an Optional<Semantic> to represent this is a major memory waste, as Semantic is 56 bytes, so Optional<Semantic> is 64 bytes!
        Putting one level of indirection through a unique_ptr thus saves 56 bytes for each VariableDeclaration (and FunctionDeclaration and StructureElement) that does not have a Semantic,
        at the low cost of one pointer dereference when accessing the field for those that have one.

        This patch also reorders the fields of FunctionDefinition to save another 8 bytes.

        No new tests as there is no intended functional change.

        REGRESSION (iOS 13): Tapping an element with a click event handler no longer clears the selection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199430

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        After <trac.webkit.org/r245067>, we no longer immediately clear the text selection when recognizing a single tap
        in WKContentView, and instead only clear it out in the case where the single tap didn't result in a click event
        in the web process. This fixed an issue wherein the text selection would be prematurely cleared when tapping,
        but also made it such that tapping on an element with a click event handler would not cause the selection to
        change, even if preventDefault() is not called on mousedown. On web pages that add a click event listener to
        `document.body`, it's nearly impossible to dismiss text selections by tapping elsewhere in the body.

        On macOS, this works because EventHandler::handleMousePressEventSingleClick contains logic to modify the
        selection when handling a mousedown, as a part of default behavior. However, there is platform-specific logic
        added in <trac.webkit.org/r233311> that avoids changing the selection when handling a synthetic mousedown on
        iOS; this is because we defer to the single tap text interaction gesture on iOS, which (among other things)
        provides additional support for moving the selection to word boundaries, instead of the editing position
        directly under the click.

        However, no such platform-specific text interaction single tap gesture exists for non-editable text, so there's
        no reason we need to bail in the case where the root editable element is null. We can fix this bug without
        breaking the fix in r233311 by matching macOS behavior and not bailing via early return in the case where the
        single tap would move selection into non-editable text.

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        The FetchResponse::BodyLoader class has a FetchLoader member that is
        initialized in the start() method with the reference of the owning
        FetchResponse::BodyLoader object. This reference doesn't change when
        the FetchResponse::BodyLoader object is moved into a different object
        and the FetchLoader unique_ptr along with it, leading to problems when
        that FetchLoader tries to invoke the FetchLoaderClient methods on the
        FetchResponse::BodyLoader object that's been moved from and is possibly
        already destroyed.

        To avoid this, the FetchResponse::BodyLoader has the move constructor
        removed and is now managed through std::unique_ptr instead of Optional,
        ensuring the FetchResponse::BodyLoader object itself isn't moved around.

        Assertion fires when animating the 'class' attribute of an SVG element
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197372

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        All instances of SVG animated properties have to share a single animVal
        such that once its value is progressed, all the instances will see the
        change. This was not happening for SVGAnimatedPrimitiveProperty. To do
        that we need to:

        -- Introduce the new template class SVGSharedPrimitiveProperty which is
           derived from SVGProperty. This class manages a single primitive value.
        -- Change the type of SVGAnimatedPrimitiveProperty::m_animVal to
           RefPtr<SVGSharedPrimitiveProperty<PropertyType>>. The master property
           creates it and all the instances hold references to the same pointer.
        -- Change the type of SVGAnimatedPrimitiveProperty::m_baseVal to
           Ref<SVGSharedPrimitiveProperty<PropertyType>> for simplicity and get
           rid of SVGAnimatedPrimitiveProperty::m_state.
        -- Override the virtual methods instanceStartAnimation() and
           instanceStopAnimation() of SVGAnimatedPrimitiveProperty.
        -- SVGAnimatedStringAnimator should invalidate the style of the target
           element if attribute name is 'class' and when its animVal changes.

        Optional<UniqueRef<..>> is not only semantically weird (UniqueRef is basically a unique_ptr that promises not to be null), but also inefficient, wasting 8 bytes for the boolean in Optional.
        It is a pattern that appears throughout the AST. In this patch I start by removing it in a fairly simple spot: the initializer for VariableDeclaration.

        includes firing the 'unload' event in the current document and in all the documents in the subframes.
        As a result, FrameLoader::detachChildren() is the right prevent such navigations. We were actually trying
        to do this via the SubframeLoadingDisabler stack variable inside detachChildren(). The issue is that this
        only prevents navigation in the subframes (i.e. <iframe> elements), not the main frame. As a result,
        script would be able to navigate the top-frame even though detachChildren() is being called on the top
        frame. To address the issue, I now create a NavigationDisabler variable in the scope of detachChildren()
        when detachChildren() is called on the top frame. NavigationDisabler prevents all navigations within the
        page, including navigations on the main/top frame.

        REGRESSION(r240047): Overflow scrollers on WK1 fail to update their content size when it changes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199360
        <rdar://problem/51643386>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        r240047 replaced didCommitChangesForLayer() mechanism by a more narrow didChangePlatformLayerForLayer.
        Unfortunately on WK1 we relied on scroll layers being invalidated after every size (and scrollbar) change.
        Without this invalidation we don't call WebChromeClientIOS::addOrUpdateScrollingLayer and the UIKit delegate
        that resizes the UIScrollView content.

        Fix by removing the scroll layer invalidation mechanism from LegacyWebKitScrollingLayerCoordinator completely and instead
        simply update all scroll layers after commit. The UIKit delegate doesn't do any significant work if nothing changes,
        this was not a very meaninful optimization.

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        The delayed startup was due to a mix of buffering feedback
        messages not handled correctly by the player. We were handling
        download and streaming buffering metrics without distinction.
        Range requests (used for seeking) were also triggering on-disk
        buffering in some cases. The buffering percentage estimation based
        on network read position was not working either because uint64_t
        division doesn't return a floating point value.

        No new tests, existing media tests cover this patch.

        Parse the arguments passed to `console.count` and `console.countReset` before sending it to
        the `ConsoleClient` so that an error can be thrown if the first argument doesn't `toString`
        nicely (e.g. without throwing an error).

        Generate call stacks for `console.countReset` to match other `console` methods. Also do this
        for `console.time`, `console.timeLog`, and `console.timeEnd`. Limit the call stack to only
        have the top frame, so no unnecessary/extra data is sent to the frontend (right now, only
        the call location is displayed).

        Rename `title` to `label` for `console.time`, `console.timeLog`, and `console.timeEnd` to
        better match the spec.

        [WHLSL] Implement arrays and MakeArrayReference
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198414

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

        This patch implements WHLSL arrays. The main implementation detail is that
        arrays get compiled to use Metal's array type. To make everything work, this
        patch also fixes a few bugs:
        - The checker now allows "operator.length" to be called on arrays. Prior to
        this patch, it was just allowed on array references.
        
        - The preserve variable lifetimes pass now looks at MakeArrayReference nodes.
        Prior to this patch, it just looked at MakePointerExpression.
        
        - We were producing the wrong type for ander arguments for indexed accesses
        on array types. We were saying the argument that was produced was a reference
        to an array instead of an array reference to the element type.
        
        - The trie we compose for the reverse type hierarchy was inserting elements
        into the wrong "children" vector. We were always inserting things into the
        top level vector. This is wrong when we have a nesting of types > 1.
        
        I also found a bug with having arrays of pointers when writing this patch.

        [Async overflow scrolling] Fix missing or misplaced content inside overflow:scroll
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199253
        rdar://problem/51855156, rdar://problem/51934514

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        This patch fixes a couple of related issues triggered by failing to composite layers inside non-stacking-context
        overflow scroll.

        First, we relied on overlap testing to composite position:relative layers inside overflow:scroll, but this only
        worked when they came later in z-order, so didn't work for layers with negative z-index.
        RenderLayerCompositor::requiresCompositingForIndirectReason() was intended to trigger compositing in such cases,
        but it only did so for position:absolute inside stacking-context scroller, because
        isNonScrolledLayerInsideScrolledCompositedAncestor() tested ancestorMovedByScroller && !layerMovedByScroller.

        I fixed this by sharing code between the three places that ask whether compositing crosses a containing-block
        boundary to call a single function, RenderLayerCompositor::layerScrollBehahaviorRelativeToCompositedAncestor(),
        that returns a ScrollPositioningBehavior. We now do compositing for both "moves" and "stationary" behaviors (but
        not "none"), ensuring that position:relative inside non-stacking scroller is always composited.

        However, this would trigger compositing on layers that should be using backing sharing; if they were outside the
        visible part of the scroller, the overlap code would not trigger, but the
        "IndirectCompositingReason::OverflowScrollPositioning" code would. This is undesirable; any layer that can use
        backing sharing should, because that's fewer composited layers, so smaller layer trees and less backing store.
        To fix this, I moved the backing-sharing check before the overlap check in
        RenderLayerCompositor::computeCompositingRequirements().

        The "layer.setHasCompositingDescendant(currentState.subtreeIsCompositing)" line was in the wrong place,
        triggering assertions on some content; "subtreeIsCompositing" only refers to child layers, so this bit needs to
        be set right after we've traversed the z-order lists.

        In some cases the geometry of the shape mask layer added to m_childContainmentLayer, for
        border-radius, was incorrect. GraphicsLayerCA::updateClippingStrategy() treated
        the rounded rect as if it were in renderer coordinates, but to match the other geometry
        on GraphicsLayer, it should in GraphicsLayer coordinates, so we need to offset by
        clipLayer->offsetFromRenderer().
        
        In addition, RenderLayerBacking::updateChildClippingStrategy() is called from
        the updateConfiguration(), which is before we've set offsetFromRenderer() on the clipLayer.
        This first call is really to find out whether the platform supports this rounded rect
        as a shape mask.
        
        So we need to call setMasksToBoundsRect() a second time in RenderLayerBacking::updateGeometry()
        after clipLayers's offsetFromRenderer() has been computed.

        [Pointer Events] Respect pointer capture when dispatching mouse boundary events and updating :hover

        Up until now, we would not account for pointer capture (see ​https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#pointer-capture) when dispatching
        mouse boundary events (mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave) and their counterpart pointer events. We would also not account
        for it when updating :hover styles.

        Now, when pointer capture changes for an element, we call setCapturingMouseEventsElement() on the EventHandler such that the element
        that would naturally hit-test is overridden by the pointer capture element when identifying which target to use for the dispatch of
        boundary mouse events. Additionally, when calling Document::prepareMouseEvent(), we also use the pointer capture element to
        pass down to Document::updateHoverActiveState() such that :hover styles are applied to the correct element.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::prepareMouseEvent): When a new event is going to be dispatched, we must run the Process Pending Capture Element
        steps as mandated by the Pointer Events spec. Calling this will dispatch the appropriate pointer capture change events and also
        required boundary events since EventHandler::setCapturingMouseEventsElement() calls into EventHandler::updateMouseEventTargetNode().
        Since this may update the capturing mouse events element, we ensure that we call updateHoverActiveState() with a flag that indicates that.
        Finally, we use the capturing mouse events element instead of the hit-testing element to pass to updateHoverActiveState() to ensure
        that is has :hover styles applied.
        (WebCore::Document::updateHoverActiveState): Account for the new CaptureChange flag to force the invalidation of the :hover and :active
        elements chain at all times when the capturing mouse events element changed.
        * dom/Document.h:
        * dom/PointerEvent.h: Update PointerEvent::createForPointerCapture() to take specific parameters rather than a single PointerEvent to
        set the pointerId, isPrimary and pointerType properties of the generated event. This is required to call processPendingPointerCapture()
        outside of PointerEvent dispatch logic since we now call it from Document::prepareMouseEvent() where we haven't yet generated such an
        event.
        * page/EventHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::pointerCaptureElementDidChange): When a new pointer capture element is set, call updateMouseEventTargetNode()
        to ensure that boundary events are fired to indicate the pointer capture state change.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::prepareMouseEvent): Keep track of the last PlatformMouseEvent used to prepare a mouse event so that we can use
        it when setCapturingMouseEventsElement() is called.
        * page/EventHandler.h:
        * page/PointerCaptureController.cpp:
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::pointerCaptureElement): Since Document::prepareMouseEvent() needs to know the current pointer capture
        element, add a new public method that indicates the pointer capture element if that element is contained in the provided document. We need
        to provide the document since PointerCaptureController is owned by the Page and may manage several documents.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEvent): Only run the Process Pending Capture Element steps when dealing with a touch or pen
        event since those steps are already ran for mouse events in Document::prepareMouseEvent(). Additionally, since the element target is already
        set to be the pointer capture element with the changes made to processPendingPointerCapture(), and because on iOS pointer capture is always
        active, we can remove the code that would retarget the event to the pointer capture element.

        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::cancelPointer):
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::processPendingPointerCapture): We now call into EventHandler::setCapturingMouseEventsElement() when the

        [Text autosizing] [iPadOS] Revise our heuristics to determine idempotent text autosizing candidates
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198763
        <rdar://problem/51826266>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch adjusts existing text autosizing heuristics, based on a survey of text on websites in the Alexa top
        500 that shrink down to fit the viewport when requesting the desktop version of the site. The new heuristic is
        derived from training decision trees against the dataset obtained from this survey, and balances false positives
        (cases where layout is broken due to autosizing) against overall accuracy (measured using cross-validation).

        See below for more details. Additionally, please refer to the link in the radar for more details, as well as
        resources used to generate, validate, and analyze these decision trees.

        * rendering/style/RenderStyle.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderStyle::isIdempotentTextAutosizingCandidate const):

        Rename AutosizeStatus::shouldSkipSubtree to RenderStyle::isIdempotentTextAutosizingCandidate. We relocate this
        logic to RenderStyle, such that we're able to ask the element's RenderStyle questions when determining whether
        the element should be autosized.

        Of course, this patch additionally revamps the heuristic used to determine whether it is safe to autosize an
        element. Our current heuristic in trunk simply checks for the presence of inline block display, out of flow
        positioning and a fixed height ancestor; if any of these conditions are satisfied, we opt the element out of
        text autosizing. This is an excellent strategy for boosting some runs of text while avoiding autosizing in the
        vast majority of cases where increasing font size may lead to layout breakage (e.g. overlapping or clipped text,
        content unexpectedly flowing to the next line, etc.). However, it also avoids boosting font sizes in many
        scenarios where boosting font sizes is desired; for concrete examples, see the (currently 24) radars about small
        font sizes that are duped to <rdar://problem/51826266>.

        To help analyze and identify trends in autosizable and non-autosizable text, we assembled a dataset of elements
        with text from the Alexa top 500 that either: (1) were too small and could be boosted safely, or (2) would break
        layout if boosted. With this labeled dataset, we then trained binary decision trees to classify the data. Each
        decision tree was trained with a number of hyperparameters: namely, maximum depth, minimum leaf size, and the
        amount of bias towards negative samples (i.e. the ratio of the weight of a non-autosizable sample relative to
        the weight of an autosizable sample).

        For each 3-tuple of these hyperparameters (800 in total: max depth between 3 and 10, min leaf size between 1 and
        10 and bias between 1 and 10), for 5000 iterations each, we split the full dataset into a training dataset and
        a cross-validation dataset, trained a decision tree using the training set, and tested against the cross-
        validation set to compute average precision, recall, and overall accuracy for each tuple of hyperparameters.

        The decision tree introduced in this patch was generated using a hand-picked set of hyperparameters (max depth
        10, min leaf size 4, and negative bias 2) to provide a balance between precision scores (limiting layout
        breakage) and recall score (ensuring that small text is mostly autosized), while optimizing for overall
        accuracy. Cross-validation scores predict that the overall accuracy of this classifier is approximately 70%, up
        from the current accuracy in trunk (~53%).

        [Pointer Events WPT] Unskip imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/pointerevents/pointerevent_lostpointercapture_is_first.html
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197005

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We were calling processPendingPointerCapture() at the wrong time, calling in after dispatching a PointerEvent rather than before.
        We now do this correctly in the consolidated PointerCaptureController::dispatchEvent() method, which we call for dispatching all
        PointerEvents, save for gotpointercapture and lostpointercapture since these should not yield the processing of the pending pointer
        capture per the spec.

        This uncovered a couple of new issues. First, since we would now call processPendingPointerCapture() and dispatch a lostpointercapture
        event earlier, the alternative lostpointercapture dispatch when an element is removed (which is dispatched asynchronously on the
        document) would be dispatched *after* dispatching the event in processPendingPointerCapture(). We now check in processPendingPointerCapture()
        whether the event target is connected to fix this. This makes sure pointerevent_lostpointercapture_for_disconnected_node.html doesn't regress.

        Finally, we must also call processPendingPointerCapture() when implicitly releasing pointer capture during handling of a "pointerup" event.
        This ensures that pointerevent_releasepointercapture_invalid_pointerid.html doesn't regress.

        As a result of all these changes, we now pass imported/w3c/web-platform-tests/pointerevents/pointerevent_lostpointercapture_is_first.html reliably.

        * page/PointerCaptureController.cpp:
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEventForTouchAtIndex):
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEvent): We now more closely adhere to the spec when determining what the pointer capture target is by
        only checking for the target override. We can now do this safely since we call processPendingPointerCapture() before and not after event dispatch.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::pointerEventWasDispatched):
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::processPendingPointerCapture): Cache the pending target override to make sure that dispatching a "gotpointercapture"
        or "lostpointercapture" event during this function does not alter it until the next call is made when the next event is dispatched.

        Be consistent with our application of volume scaling. We were

        the inverse in volume(); however setting initial volumes was done
        linearly in setStreamVolumeElement, which was causing strange
        jumps in the volume level at non-deterministic times. The fix
        looks to be that we should use linear interpolation consistently,

        [Async overflow scroll] Clipped composited layers inside overflow scroll jitter and get incorrectly clipped
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199133
        rdar://problem/43614439

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Currently a composited layer with an overflow:scroll ancestor (which is not a paint-order
        ancestor) gets a single "ancestor clip layer" that represents the intersection of all the
        clips provided by its containing-block ancestors with non-visible overflow (both scrolling
        and non-scrolling ones).

        To correctly update clips with async overflow scroll, this single clip layer needs to be
        broken up into multiple clipping ancestors. We need a separate layer, and scrolling tree
        node for each ancestor that is an overflow scroll, and layers that represent non-moving
        clips (i.e. overflow:hidden and 'clip') between them. This patch adds
        LayerAncestorClippingStack to represent this stack of clipping layers. For example with the
        following content:
        
        <div style="overflow:hidden"> <--- A
            <div style="overflow:scroll"> <--- B
                <div style="overflow:hidden"> <--- C
                    <div style="overflow:hidden"> <--- D
                        <div style="overflow:scroll">  <--- E
                            <div style="overflow:hidden"> <--- F
                                <div style="overflow:hidden"> <--- G
                                    <div></div> <--- H
                                <div>
                            <div>
                        <div>
                    <div>
                <div>
            <div>
        <div>
        
        the composited RenderLayer for H owns a LayerAncestorClippingStack with the following contents:
            [clip - A]
            [scroller - B]
            [clip - intersection of C and D]
            [scroller - E]
            [clip - intersection of F and G]

        Each stack entry has a 'masksToBounds' GraphicsLayer for clipping. Entries representing
        overflow:scroll clips have a ScrollingNodeID for their OverflowScrollProxy scrolling tree
        node (which references the actual OverflowScrollingNode). The non-scroller clips in this
        stack are computed unconstrained by the enclosing overflow:scroll.

        When the OverflowScrollingNode is scrolled, the boundsOrigin of related OverflowScrollProxy nodes
        is adjusted to move the descendant layers (other clipping layers, or composited layers).

        OverflowScrollProxy nodes thus take over the role that "Moves" ScrollingTreePositionedNode had.
        With this patch, ScrollingTreePositionedNode are purely for absolute position inside non-containing-block
        stacking context overflow scroll. LayoutConstraints is renamed to AbsolutePositionConstraints accordingly.

        Add OverflowScrollProxyNodes to the scrolling tree

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Add ScrollingStateOverflowScrollProxyNode and ScrollingTreeOverflowScrollProxyNode. These
        nodes represent clip and scroll position for an overflow:scroll in the containing block chain,
        but not the paint ancestor chain of a layer. They will be used to correctly manipulate clip
        rects for composited layers in non-stacking-context scrollers, and in a future patch will
        replace the functionality of "Moves" positioned nodes.

        An OverflowScrollProxyNode has the ScrollingNodeID of the scrolling node that it relates to,
        and we use the existing "related overflow nodes" to create the back references in the scrolling tree.

        These nodes are not instantiated yet; a future patch will hook them up.

        Move from setPendingActivity/unsetPendingActivity to an
        m_pendingActivity member which is easier to manage.

        Keep setting a pending activity for AudioContext at construction time
        but do not do that for Offline contexts.
        Instead, set the pending activity when startRendering is called.
        Unset the pending activity when the rendering activity is finished.

        Make m_audioDecoder a unique pointer so that it can lazily be initialized.
        This removes the burden of creating an audio decoder thread for each context.

        [Pointer Events] Respect pointer capture when dispatching mouse boundary events and updating :hover
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198999

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Up until now, we would not account for pointer capture (see https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#pointer-capture) when dispatching
        mouse boundary events (mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave) and their counterpart pointer events. We would also not account
        for it when updating :hover styles.

        Now, when pointer capture changes for an element, we call setCapturingMouseEventsElement() on the EventHandler such that the element
        that would naturally hit-test is overridden by the pointer capture element when identifying which target to use for the dispatch of
        boundary mouse events. Additionally, when calling EventHandler::prepareMouseEvent(), we also use the pointer capture element to
        eventually pass down to Document::updateHoverActiveState() such that :hover styles are applied to the correct element.

        This also means that we need to re-run EventHandler::prepareMouseEvent() during mouse state changes to ensure that the :hover styles
        are applied correctly should the pointer capture element change during dispatch of boundary mouse events.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::prepareMouseEvent): If there is one, use the pointer capture element instead of the hit-test target.
        (WebCore::Document::updateHoverActiveState): Relax the mustBeInActiveChain condition in case the pointer capture element changed when
        updating the :hover/:active chains.
        * page/EventHandler.cpp:
        (WebCore::EventHandler::handleMousePressEvent): Re-process the mouse event if the pointer capture element changed during event dispatch.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::handleMouseMoveEvent): Re-process the mouse event if the pointer capture element changed during event dispatch.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::handleMouseReleaseEvent): As we know the pointer capture element will be reset as part of the mouse being
        released, we reset the pointer capture element and EventHandler's capture element prior to invalidating hover styles and boundary events.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::setCapturingMouseEventsElement): Dispatch boundary events when a new element is set.
        (WebCore::EventHandler::dispatchMouseEvent): New dispatchMouseEvent() variant that re-processes the provided MouseEventWithHitTestResults
        in case the pointer capture element changes during event dispatch, as called by handleMousePressEvent() and handleMouseMoveEvent().
        * page/EventHandler.h:
        * page/PointerCaptureController.cpp:
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::pointerCaptureElement): We now need to query whay the pointer capture element might be from EventHandler,
        so expose a new method to access it.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::releasePointerCapture): Since we may not call processPendingPointerCapture() until the dispatch of the
        next event, we must reset EventHandler's capturing mouse element right now so that the next event processed does not use it as an overriding target.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::hasPointerCapture): We would mistakenly return true if the provided element was null, which could be the
        case of EventHandler's capturing element. Rather than changing call sites to check that the provided value exists, we change the method to
        return false when the provided element is null. Note that this does not affect the API since it's exposed on Element itself.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEventForTouchAtIndex): Call dispatchEvent() instead of calling pointerEventWillBeDispatched() and
        pointerEventWasDispatched().
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::dispatchEvent): Remove all code specific to pointer capture since now the events will be dispatched on the
        pointer capture element by EventHandler.
        (WebCore::PointerCaptureController::processPendingPointerCapture): Make sure this method is not re-entrant since it dispatches events.
        * page/PointerCaptureController.h:
        * rendering/HitTestRequest.h:
        (WebCore::HitTestRequest::pointerCaptureElementChanged const): Add a new HitTestRequestType bit such that we can indicate to Document::updateHoverActiveState()
        that it must be update the :hover/:active chains when the pointer capture element has just changed.

        Tested manually.

        This change just adds a counter to the number of times the user explicitly
        denies storage access and returns early if the counter has reached the limit
        of 2.

        We hoped that iframes that request storage access would count the number
        of times the user has been asked and not repeat the request over and over.
        However, we're seeing pretty aggressive use of the API and users are
        complaining. Therefore, we need a cap on how many times an iframed
        document can ask if it is explicitly denied access by the user.

        This is a first measure. If we see continued aggressive use of the API,
        we'll have to consider more drastic measures.

        Rename RealtimeVideoSource in RealtimeVideoCaptureSource.
        Introduce RealtimeVideoSource as a class wrapping RealtimeVideoCaptureSource.
        Its goal is to be able to have independent settings from its underlying RealtimeVideoCaptureSource.
        It can also adapt size based on its settings if different than its RealtimeVideoCaptureSource.
        Apply this wrapping for AV video sources as well as mock video sources.

        [WHLSL] Hook up common texture functions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198704
        <rdar://problem/51668841>

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch adds the Metal implementation of the Sample(), Load(), and GetDimensions()
        texture functions. The implementation simply performs string concatenation to produce the 
        correct results, and adds many new native functions to the standard library.

        We can't zero-fill texture types or sampler types, so this patch forbids default
        constructors for those types. It also forbids those types to exist within arrays, array
        references, or pointers, becuase an out-of-bounds access may cause us to try to zero-fill
        them.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson and Myles C. Maxfield.

        This patch makes it so that the Checker assigns types to the internal variables
        in a read modify write expression. These were the only variables that didn't have
        types ascribed to them.

        This patch also does a fly by fix where we kept pointers to value types
        in a HashMap in the checker. This is wrong precisely when the HashMap gets
        resized. Instead, we now just store the value itself since we're just
        dealing with a simple Variant that wraps either an empty struct or an
        enum.

        positions the clip layer using FrameView::yPositionForInsetClipLayer(), so it's not just

        [WHLSL] Support matrices
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198876
        <rdar://problem/51768882>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson and Myles Maxfield.

        This patch adds in support for matrices to WHLSL. Most matrix related code
        is defined by the standard library. This patch just needed to add support
        for the native functions operator[] and operator[]= on matrix types. The only
        native functions that are named operator[] and operator[]= are for matrix
        operations, so we strongly assume when generating code for native operator[] and
        operator[]= that we're dealing with matrix types.
        
        operator[]= ignores the write if the index is out of bounds. operator[]
        returns a zeroed vector if the index is out of bounds.  
        
        This patch also incorporates two bug fixes:
        1. This patch takes Robin's patch in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198313 to ensure
        we don't have pointers to values in a hash map. This was needed in this patch
        otherwise we'd crash parsing the standard library.
        
        2. This patch fixes how we handle "break" in metal codegen. When I first
        implemented break, I strongly assumed we were in a loop. However, break
        can be either from a loop or from switch. This patch teaches the metal code
        generator to track which context we're in and to emit code accordingly.

        Add support for WeakRef
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198710

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        We need to make sure the Web MicrotaskQueue notifies the JSC VM
        that it has finished performing a microtask checkpoint. This lets
        the JSC VM know it is safe to collect referenced WeakRefs. Since
        there was no way to get the VM from the MicrotaskQueue I have
        added a RefPtr to the queue's VM. For the main thread the VM lives
        forever so is fine. For workers the queue and the VM share an
        owner so this shouldn't matter either.

        [WHLSL] Do not generate duplicate constructors/copy constructors in synthesizeConstructors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198580

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        Prior to this patch, we were generating duplicate constructors 
        for unnamed types. This is bad for two reasons:
        1. It's inefficient, since we'd generate a constructor for every place in
        the AST where we'd visit this unnamed type.
        2. It made it impossible to resolve function overloads to call
        the default constructor. This made it so that the autoInitializeVariables
        pass would crash if we ever generated more than one of these functions
        for the same type.
        
        To make this work, this patch splits up what used to be the resolveNamesInFunctions
        pass. Previously, this pass would both resolve calls and resolve type names.
        Synthesize constructors would run before this, since resolving calls meant we
        may resolve a call to one of these synthesized constructors. However, synthesize
        constructors now needs to test for the equality unnamed types, so it now requires
        running the type resolution part of resolveNamesInFunctions before it runs.
        
        This patch splits resolveNamesInFunctions into two parts:
        resolveTypeNamesInFunctions and resolveCallsInFunctions.
        
        So we used to run:
        synthesizeConstructors
        resolveNamesInFunctions
        
        And now we run:
        resolveTypeNamesInFunctions 
        synthesizeConstructors
        resolveCallsInFunctions

        Convert macOS to scroll by changing layer boundsOrigin
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198917

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        macOS did frame and overflow scrolling by changing the position of the scrolled
        contents layer. iOS scrolls by changing the boundsOrigin of the scrollContainer layer
        (which it has to, to match how UIScrollView works).

        The iOS approach removes the need for an extra layer whose only role is for
        scroll positioning, so migrate macOS to the same approach. A later patch can remove
        m_scrolledContentsLayer.
        
        We can remove RenderLayerCompositor::m_clipLayer since m_scrollContainerLayer has exactly
        the same role now.

        [WHLSL] Make .length work
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198890

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        This patch makes accessing .length on buffers work. To make this work as
        expected, I've fixed a handful of small bugs:
        
        - The checker was not calling resolveByInstantiation for getters. This patch
          modifies the checker to do that, so we can now resolve a getter to
          "operator.length". I also refactored the checker to have a helper method
          that both does overload resolution and resolveByInstantiation to make it
          difficult to forget to call resolveByInstantiation.
        - The property resolver had a bug where it would return a non-null value
          in anderCallArgument for array references even when there was no ander and
          no thread ander function. This patch makes it now return null if there is
          neither an ander nor a thread ander.
        - The metal codegen incorrectly unpacked the length of buffers. It swapped the
          bottom four bytes and the top four bytes of the size_t value. This patch
          corrects that. This was also a cause of flakiness in various tests since
          we ended up with a length much larger than expected, leading to bounds
          checks always passing in our tests.
        - This patch also fixes our tests to specify the output buffer length
          properly for various programs.

        Support using ANGLE as the backend for the WebGL implementation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197755

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Add new files supplying an ANGLE version of GraphicsContext3D and
        Extensions3D, conditionalized under USE_ANGLE. Update Xcode project to
        build these files. This option compiles and links successfully.

        FIXMEs remain in several common files which will be addressed in
        subsequent patches.

        This work will be tested with the preexisting WebGL conformance
        suite.

        Implement ScrollableArea::scrollOffset()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198895

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Remove from ScrollableArea the following:
            virtual int scrollSize(ScrollbarOrientation) const = 0;
            virtual int scrollOffset(ScrollbarOrientation) const = 0;
        and instead implement ScrollOffset scrollOffset() const.

        Also make scrollPosition() pure virtual, avoiding the reverse dependency where
        this base class implementation got values from scrollbars.
        
        scrollSize(ScrollbarOrientation) was only used by ScrollAnimatorIOS and we can
        do the same computation via min/max scroll positions.
        
        RenderListBox and PopupMenuWin need implementations of scrollPosition().
        
        Remove some PLATFORM(IOS_FAMILY) #ifdefs from ScrollableArea for code that compiles
        on all platforms.

        Baseline offset is the baseline's distance from the line's logical top -and it is not necessarily the same as the baseline's ascent.
        It's easier to track the baseline and its top separately since certain properties only change one or the other.

        Normally the available width for an in-flow block level box is the width of the containing block's content box.
        However a non-floating positioned float avoider box might be constrained by existing floats.
        The idea here is that we pre-compute(estimate) the vertical position and check the current floating context for
        left and right floats. These floats contrain the available width and this computed value should be used instead of the containing block's
        content box's width whe calculating the used width for width: auto.

        [WHLSL] Implement out-of-bounds and nullptr behavior
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198600
        <rdar://problem/51668853>

        Reviewed by Robin Morisset.

        The behavior we're implementing is:
        - OOB writes are ignored.
        - OOB reads return zero.
        - Writes to null are ignored.
        - Reads from null return zero.
        - &*x == x, including &*null == null.
        
        We implement this like so:
        - The value stack in FunctionWriter turns into a stack of pairs: rvalues and lvalues.
          rvalues are represented the same as before. Lvalues are always pointers.
        - Anything that produces an lvalue must push a pointer to the stack. Not
          all things produce lvalues, so that entry in the stack may be empty.
          However, all things that produce lvalues also produce rvalues. So, "*x = 42" works,
          and so does "foo(*x)". Nodes that produce lvalues are responsible for also producing
          an rvalue, which should be the value as if the lvalue was dereferenced at that point
          in program execution. So the "*x" in "thread int* x = null; *x" produces the int zero
          for its rvalue, and null for its lvalue.
        - Dereference just works, as dereference produces both an lvalue and rvalue. Dereference
          node's child must also be an lvalue. So we just forward that value along on
          the stack. For the rvalue, if we try to dereference nullptr, we just fill in
          zero bytes instead. Otherwise, the rvalue is the result of dereferencing the
          non-null pointer.
        - Assignment expressions check if the incoming lvalue is null. If it is, it
          skips the assignment.
        - operator&[] returns nullptr on an OOB access. Then, based on the above
          behavior, we get the desired OOB reads return zero, and OOB writes are
          ignored.
        - MakePointerExpression just takes the last lvalue off the stack (which must
          be a pointer) and returns it as an rvalue.
        - VariableReference will push both the variable value and a pointer to the variable
          onto the stack.

        This patch also fixes a few bugs where we weren't giving certain AST nodes the
        proper address space values.

        This patch also removes code to generate native functions for operators
        "operator[]" and "operator[]=" as we should never be generating these
        ourselves. We should only be generating the "operator&[]" ander.

        [WHLSL] Hook up compute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198644

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch hooks up compute shaders in exactly the same way that vertex and fragment shaders
        are hooked up. I've modified the two patchs (compute and rendering) to be almost exactly the
        same code.

        This patch also adds support for the WHLSL compiler to determine what the numthreads()
        attribute in the shader says so that it can be hooked up to Metal's threads-per-threadgroup
        argument in the dispatch call. There is some logic to make sure that there aren't two
        numthreads() attributes on the same compute shader.

        It also adds a little bit of type renaming. For built-in variables, sometimes Metal's type
        doesn't always match WHLSL's (and HLSL's type). For example, in WHLSL and HLSL,        SV_DispatchThreadID variables have to be a float3, but in Metal, they are a uint3.
        Therefore, I've added a little bit of code during each entry point's pack and unpack stages
        to handle this type conversion.

        [WHLSL] Hook up compute
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198644

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This patch hooks up compute shaders in exactly the same way that vertex and fragment shaders
        are hooked up. I've modified the two patchs (compute and rendering) to be almost exactly the
        same code.

        This patch also adds support for the WHLSL compiler to determine what the numthreads()
        attribute in the shader says so that it can be hooked up to Metal's threads-per-threadgroup
        argument in the dispatch call. There is some logic to make sure that there aren't two
        numthreads() attributes on the same compute shader.

        It also adds a little bit of type renaming. For built-in variables, sometimes Metal's type
        doesn't always match WHLSL's (and HLSL's type). For example, in WHLSL and HLSL,        SV_DispatchThreadID variables have to be a float3, but in Metal, they are a uint3.
        Therefore, I've added a little bit of code during each entry point's pack and unpack stages
        to handle this type conversion.

        [WHLSL] Implement array references
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198163

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        The compiler automatically generates anders for every array reference. Luckily, the infrastructure
        to generate those anders and emit Metal code to represent them already exists in the compiler.
        There are two pieces remaining (which this patch implements):

        1. The JavaScript compiler has a behavior where anders that are called with an array reference
           as an argument don't wrap the argument in a MakePointerExpression. This is because the array
           reference is already a reference type, so it's silly to operate on a pointer to a reference.
           This patch implements this by teaching the type checker about which types should be passed
           to the ander call, and by actually constructing those types in the property resolver.
           The property resolver does this by placing the logic to construct an ander argument in a
           single function which also has logic to save the argument in a temporary if the thread ander
           will be called. The semantics about which functions are called in which situations are not
           changed; instead, we just simply don't wrap array references with MakePointerExpressions.

        2. Creating a bind group from the WebGPU API has to retain information about buffer lengths for
           each buffer so the shader can properly perform bounds checks. This can be broken down into a
           few pieces:
           - Creating a bind group layout has to assign extra id indexes for each buffer which will be
             filled in to represent the buffer's length
           - Creating the bind group itself needs to fill in the buffer length into the Metal argument
             buffer
           - The shader compiler needs to emit code at the beginning of entry point to find the buffer
             lengths and pack them together into the array reference (array references correspond to
             a Metal struct with two fields: a pointer and a length).

        This patch doesn't actually implement bounds checks themselves; it just hooks up the buffer
        lengths so https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198600 can implement it.

        The shader compiler's API is modified to allow for this extra buffer length information to be
        passed in from the WebGPU implementation.

        Unfortunately, I don't think I could split this patch up into two pieces because both are
        required to test the compiler with buffers.

        Add a runtime flag to either choose the new WebSocket code path or the previously existing one.
        The switch is done at WebSocket channel API level which offers the necessary high level API to abstract the two code paths.
        By default, we continue using the current WebSocket implementation.
        Covered by manual testing on current WebSocket tests.

        [WHLSL] Educate the property resolver about IndexExpressions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198399

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This is part one of two patches which will allow buffers to work. This patch
        adds support in the property resolver for index expressions. Index expressions
        get turned into calls to "getter indexers", "setter indexers", or "ander
        indexers". They work almost identically to dot expressions, except there is an
        extra "index" expression which gets turned into an extra argument to those
        functions.

        There's actually a bit of a trick here. Let's say we need to run a getter and
        a setter separately (e.g. "foo[3]++;"). The index expression can't be duplicated
        for both the getter and the setter (e.g. the functions are
        int operator[](Foo, uint) and Foo operator[]=(Foo, uint, int), and we aren't
        allowed to execute the index expression multiple times. Consider if that "3"
        in the example is actually "bar()" with some side effect. So, we have to run
        the index expression once at the correct time, and save its result to a temporary
        variable, and then pass in the temporary variable into the getter and setter.

        So, if the code says "foo[bar()][baz()] = quux();" the following sequence of
        functions get run:

        - bar()
        - operator[](Foo, uint)
        - baz()
        - quux()
        - operator[]=(OtherType, uint, OtherOtherType)
        - operator[]=(Foo, uint, OtherType)

        The next patch will modify the WebGPU JavaScript implementation to send buffer
        lengths to the shader, and for the shader compiler to correctly unpack this
        information and place it inside the array references. That should be everything
        that's needed to get buffers to work. After that, hooking up compute should be
        fairly trivial.

        [CSP] Blob URLs should inherit their CSP policy

        <rdar://problem/51366878>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        As per <https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#security-inherit-csp> (Editor's Draft, 28 February 2019) blob
        URLs should inherit their CSP policy from their parent (if they have one).

        Test: http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/navigate-self-to-blob.html

        is a Blob URL.
        (WebCore::Document::initContentSecurityPolicy): Take a pointer to a ContentSecurityPolicy object that
        represents the previous document's CSP. We only make us of this if the current URL is a Blob URL or a data
        URL. Otherwise, do what we do now and take the policy from the owner frame.
        * dom/Document.h:
        * loader/DocumentWriter.cpp:
        (WebCore::DocumentWriter::begin): Extend the lifetime of the previous document temporarily so that we can
        pass its CSP to FrameLoader::didBeginDocument(). We need to do this extension because this function calls
        FrameLoader::clear(), which can destroy the previous document and its ContentSecurityPolicy object. This
        extension is also no different than if this function was called with a non-null ownerDocument except that
        in that case it is the caller that extends the previous document's lifetime. Although it is tempting to
        make use of ownerDocument to fix this bug by having the caller of begin() pass the previous document as
        the ownerDocument when the new document's url (the one we are begin()ing) is a Blob URL. The ownerDocument
        concept would privilege the Blob URL more than necessary; we only need to inherit the CSP policy from the
        previous document for a Blob URL, not inherit the cookie URL or strict mixed content checking bit, etc. 
        We could make ContentSecurityPolicy ref-counted or even steal the ContentSecurityPolicy object from the
        previous document. The latter is not of the question as a future enhancement, but the former seemed excessive
        as a way to avoid extending the lifetime of the previous document because this would be the *only* call site
        that actaully takes out a second ref of a ContentSecurityPolicy object. In general, shared ownership of
        a ContentSecurityPolicy object does not make sense.

        [WHLSL] Auto initialize local variables
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198426

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        This patch implements zero-filling for local variables in two parts:
        1. We add a new pass, autoInitializeVariables, which makes any variable declaration
        without an initializer call the default constructor for the variable's type.
        Since we auto generate the default constructor, it's a native function whose
        implementation we control.
        
        2. Each native constructor is implemented as a memset(&value, sizeof(value), 0).
        This memset is an inlined loop in each constructor. The reason this turns
        everything into zero is that for every primitive type, the "zero" value is
        represented as all zeroes in memory: float, int, pointers, etc.
        
        Since our ability to test some of this is limited, I opened a follow-up bug to
        test this more:

        REGRESSION (r244182) [WK1]: Page updates should always scheduleCompositingLayerFlush() immediately
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198664

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Because WK1 is a single process, scheduleCompositingLayerFlush() has to 
        be called immediately when layers' update is needed. Otherwise no content
        will be drawn for the current frame. Doing this will get smooth scrolling
        back to WK1.

        RenderingUpdateScheduler now has three different scheduling methods:

        1. scheduleTimedRenderingUpdate(): This is a two-steps scheduling method.
           DisplayRefreshMonitor has to fire before scheduleCompositingLayerFlush()
           is called. This is used by rAF, WebAnimations and intersection and
           resize observers.

        2. scheduleImmediateRenderingUpdate(): This is a one-step scheduling method.
           layerTreeAsText() calls this method because it has to process the rendering
           update within the current frame.

        3. scheduleRenderingUpdate(): RenderLayerCompositor::scheduleLayerFlush()
           calls this function to decide either immediately flush layers or wait
           for the next timed frame. scheduleImmediateRenderingUpdate() will be
           called for WK1. scheduleTimedRenderingUpdate() will be called for WK2.

        [MSE][GStreamer] Avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR when seeking to a buffered range just before the buffered one
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166620

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        This patch is fixing a seek to unbuffered range just before the buffered one.
        For example, supposing a [120, 176) append has filled all the memory and then
        a seek to 115.0 is done, a subsequent [115, 120) append would fail without
        this fix. EvictCodedFrames() would return without actually evicting anything,
        and appendBufferInternal will print "buffer full, failing with
        QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR error" on GStreamer platforms instead of letting the new
        [115, 120) append succeed.

        This patch is based on an original patch by iivlev <iivlev@productengine.com>

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-append-before-last-range-no-quota-exceeded.html

        The loop break condition has also been changed to deal with notFound currentTimeRange.

        [GStreamer] AVC1 decoding capabilities probing support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198569

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        When capabilities for an avc1 codec are requested, the registry scanner looks
        for a compatible decoder for the given H.264 profile and level.

        This new approach can be avoided by using the WEBKIT_GST_MAX_AVC1_RESOLUTION
        environment variable. If supplied, the decoder capabilities won't be probed and
        the codec will be advertised as supported if it complies with the contents of
        the environment variable. The resolutions currently handled are specifically:
        1080P, 720P and 480P. We don't handle framerate checking yet, so the implied
        H.264 levels are assumed to be for 30FPS.

        Firing the load event should only happen when dynamic update changes the
        attribute 'externalResourcesRequired'. Animating this attribute should
        not fire the load event.

        When stopping the animations, applyAnimatedPropertyChange() should be
        called first then stopAnimation() is called second. The target element
        should know that its svgAttributeChanged() is called because of animating
        the attribute. So it can differentiate this case from the dynamic update.

        After layer tree commit we were calling mainFrameViewportChangedViaDelegatedScrolling (even if viewport did not change)

        and we fail to update those properly.

        [WHLSL] Educate the property resolver about IndexExpressions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198399

        Reviewed by Saam Barati.

        This is part one of two patches which will allow buffers to work. This patch
        adds support in the property resolver for index expressions. Index expressions
        get turned into calls to "getter indexers", "setter indexers", or "ander
        indexers". They work almost identically to dot expressions, except there is an
        extra "index" expression which gets turned into an extra argument to those
        functions.

        There's actually a bit of a trick here. Let's say we need to run a getter and
        a setter separately (e.g. "foo[3]++;"). The index expression can't be duplicated
        for both the getter and the setter (e.g. the functions are
        int operator[](Foo, uint) and Foo operator[]=(Foo, uint, int), and we aren't
        allowed to execute the index expression multiple times. Consider if that "3"
        in the example is actually "bar()" with some side effect. So, we have to run
        the index expression once at the correct time, and save its result to a temporary
        variable, and then pass in the temporary variable into the getter and setter.

        So, if the code says "foo[bar()][baz()] = quux();" the following sequence of
        functions get run:

        - bar()
        - operator[](Foo, uint)
        - baz()
        - quux()
        - operator[]=(OtherType, uint, OtherOtherType)
        - operator[]=(Foo, uint, OtherType)

        The next patch will modify the WebGPU JavaScript implementation to send buffer
        lengths to the shader, and for the shader compiler to correctly unpack this
        information and place it inside the array references. That should be everything
        that's needed to get buffers to work. After that, hooking up compute should be
        fairly trivial.

        [WHLSL] Parsing and lexing the standard library is slow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192890
        <rdar://problem/50746335>

        Reviewed by Myles Maxfield.

        The main idea is to avoid backtracking by instead peeking at the next token (and occasionally at the one after that).
        This implies a few things:
        - We can replace the stack of tokens by a trivial ring buffer of size 2 (holding the next token and the one after, or WTF::nullopt if we are at the end of the file).
        - We now have "completeFooExpression" functions, to avoid having to reparse the prefix of some expression, if we find half-way through what it is.

        I also fixed the following parser bug:
        - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198305 [WHLSL] Multiple variables with initializers in a declaration statement crashes the compiler
            which was due to a mistake I made in the grammar

        Finally I added two new macros: CONSUME_TYPE and PARSE to eliminate about 500 lines of error propagation boilerplate.

        There are still lots of ways of improving the parser and lexer, such as:
        - finishing the conversion of tokens in the lexer, not bothering with allocating string views
        - make two special tokens Invalid and EOF, to remove the overhead of Optional
        - make peekTypes and consumeTypes use templates to avoid constructing a Vector and calling find on it.
        - Turn the entire lexer into a proper automata, not going through the same characters again and again (this is certainly the largest win by far)
        - Remove the last few pieces of backtracking from the parser.

        The current patch is already enough to make parsing the full standard library (something like 85k lines) approximately 260ms.
        This is still longer than I would like, but nowhere near the bottleneck any longer because of some other parts of the compiler.
