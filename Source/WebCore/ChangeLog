        [SOUP] Move request HTTP body handling to ResourceRequestSoup and simplify it

        We are currently adding the HTTP body to the message in ResourceHandleSoup, but we could do it as part of the
        ResourceRequest::updateSoupMessage() method, since the HTTP body is indeed part of the request. The code can be
        also simplified, especially the handling of files, by using SharedBuffer that already mmaps the file when
        possible, instead of using GMappedFile API.

        For example, if there is a "required long id" member in a dictionary that is

        [ListItems] Render tree should be all clean by the end of FrameView::layout().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162832

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        List item markers are inserted into the tree during layout, right before laying out
        the list item (that's a big FIXME). At this point we already know what part of the tree
        needs to be laid out. Inserting a list item marker does not expand this dirty area.
        However whenever we insert a new renderer into the tree, we call setNeedsLayout on the contining block chain.
        In certain cases (floating renderers), it could potentially trigger some unintentional markings
        and we return from FrameView::layout() with a dirty subtree.

        This patch preemptively marks the list item and its marker dirty so that
        when the marker is getting inserted into the tree, we stop the marking at the parent.

        Not testable.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162782

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        (Re-landing after fixing tests.)

        Because the heavy lifting for font-variation-settings is done by CoreText, 
        this patch is fairly minimal. It simply hooks up the CSS property to CoreText. 

        There is an existing bug in CoreText where variations inside fonts do not 
        survive the addition of a cascade list. Therefore, FontPlatformData::ctFont() 
        needs to work around this (conditionally) by resupplying the variation at 
        the same time as the cascade list. The CoreText bug is <rdar://problem/28449441>.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This is a Document owned stylesheet that exists as a context for parsing element inline style.
        It never contains any rules and is generally confusing.

        This patch removes the requirement for a stylesheet to be present for CSSParser to operate in
        the correct context. Inline style is now parsed without stylesheet and a context object is

        respond to UI events via the `uiDelegate` property. A Button extends a LayoutItem, another
        class that we'll subclass heavily in coming patches, which is simply a LayoutNode with a
        `layoutDelegate` which allows to set the node's `layoutTraits`, a bit-mask allowing to
        specify layout attributes such as the platform and playback styles.

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        CSSCursorImageValue copies the URL of its underlying CSSImageValue by using the
        ParsedURLString URL constructor on the String returned by CSSImageValue::url(). While
        CSSImageValues were always being constructed from a URL implicitly converted to a String,
        nothing ensured that the URL was valid. For invalid URLs, URL::string() returns the string
        it was constructed with, which might still represent a relative URL or contain non-ASCII
        characters, violating the preconditions of the ParsedURLString URL constructor and causing
        an assertion to fail in Debug builds.

        Fix this by having CSSImageValue store its image URL using a WebCore::URL rather than a
        String. CSSCursorImageValue can then copy this URL instead of attempting to re-parse a
        possibly-invalid URL string.

        [SOUP] Cleanup persistent credential storage code
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162777

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        We have this feature behind ENABLE_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE flag, which is confusing, because we use credential
        storage unconditionally and this is only about persistent storage. Also the flag assumes libsecret is available,
        and since it's only used by GTK sometimes we use GTK ifdefs instead of CREDENTIAL_STORAGE. So, I think we should
        use USE(LIBSECRET) instead, and reduce a bit the ifdefs in common soup code. Another problem is that current
        implementation is always used, while it should depend on the current network storage session and never used in
        ephemeral sessions. This patch moves the code from CredentialBackingStore to NetworkStorageSessionSoup and
        modernizes a bit.

        Media controls for Soundcloud easily falls out of sync with what's actually playing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162843
        <rdar://problem/28176874>

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Currently, audio elements are subject to the same main content restrictions as video elements. This is
        problematic on sites where audio elements are really the main content, such as soundcloud. We need a different
        heuristic for determining whether audio elements such as these should be allowed to show playback controls.

        Furthermore, we currently forbid autoplaying audio from showing controls if it has user gesture restrictions
        (i.e. it started playing via script). This is, again, problematic on sites where audio elements are played one
        after another (such as on soundcloud). Even though a subsequent audio element may have been triggered via
        script, we might want still want to show controls for it if the user has explicitly triggered other elements on
        the page to begin playing. However, if the user has not gestured on any media in the page, we still should not
        show controls for audio elements that begin playing via script.

        Adds two new unit tests to TestWebKitAPI simulating audio playback behavior on soundcloud.

        Ensuring non-HTTP redirection URLs are not followed at DocumentThreadableLoader level for fetch API only.
        This should be applied to all clients at some point, but there is still some uncertainty for data URLs.

        Did some refactoring to better separate the case of security checks in case of regular request or redirected request.
        This allows in particular to handle more clearly the case of data URLs which are allowed in all modes for regular requests.
        But they are not allowed for same-origin redirected requests.

        [Modern Media Controls] layout nodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162799
        <rdar://problem/28569301>

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Modern media controls will be using a tree of LayoutNode objects that commit to the DOM
        in coordinated `requestAnimationFrame()` calls to ensure all layouts are done in an efficient
        and coordinated manner. As a preamble, we introduced the `scheduler` singleton in
        https://webkit.org/b/162726 which is in charge of scheduling callbacks.

        A LayoutNode is created by providing an Element to its constructor, or an HTML string. Not
        providing a parameter creates a simple <div>.

        When we set a property on a LayoutNode, we call `markDirtyProperty(propertyName)` which keeps
        track of dirty properties in the `_dirtyProperties` set. When this set is non-empty, the node
        is marked as dirty and registered in the global `dirtyNodes` map, asking the shared scheduler
        that a layout is needed. When the layout is performed, all nodes in the `dirtyNodes` map are
        processed such that `commitProperty(propertyName)` is called to commit dirty properties for
        a given node to the DOM, and `layout()` is called to allow subclasses of LayoutNode to conduct
        custom layout logic that goes beyond committing a given property.

        Another reason why a node may be marked as dirty is when a DOM hierarchy change is needed. A
        host of DOM-like methods are exposed to allow flexible manipulations of nodes, with an extra
        `children` property which allows wholesale change of a node's subtree with a single array
        property assignment. Changes to the DOM hierarchy are performed in the same scheduler callback
        as style properties.

        Nodes can be marked for layout explicitly with by setting the `needsLayout` property.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        CSS Fonts level 4 [1] details the font-variation-settings property which allows variations
        to be applied to fonts which accept it. The property accepts a list of key/value
        pairs where the keys are four-character Ascii codes and the values are floating
        point values. The implementation uses font-feature-settings as a model, but with one
        big difference: font-variation-settings can be animated. The set of variation points
        are animated individually.

        This font variations work is being done behind a run-time switch, which is settable from
        the Safari Develop menu.

        Now that FontDescription is growing, I'd like to do an investigation into the possibility of
        moving some of the rare pieces of it into their own class to reduce memory. However, upon
        advice, this investigation will be fairly involved and should be done in its own bug.

        Font features and font variations are similar in that they are identified
        by four-character tags and an associated value. However, the value is an
        int for font features and is a float for font variations. In order to
        simplify code, we can use the same class for both, and use a template
        argument to distinguish between the two. Then, typedefs can be used to
        name them.

        We awkwardly track from the parser level if any stylesheet in a document uses any rem units. This is only used to minimally
        optimize a case where document element's (<html>) font size changes dynamically.

        In practice such changes are rare. Browsing around I couldn't find a single case where this optimization got used.
        Even if it was used it would be of low value as a full style resolution is likely to happen anyway (as font inherits)
        and the only thing really saved is that we don't need to invalidate the matched properties cache.

        Change the MemoryCache and CachedResource adjustSize functions to take a long argument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162708
        <rdar://problem/28555702>

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        Because the MemoryCache stores the size of the cached memory in unsigned,
        two problems my happen when reporting a change in the size of the memory:
        
        1. Signed integer overflow -- which can happen because MemoryCache::adjustSize()
           takes a signed integer argument. If the allocated or the freed memory size is
           larger than the maximum of a signed integer, an overflow will happen.
           For the image caching code, this can be seen where the unsigned decodedSize
           is casted to an integer before passing it to ImageObserver::decodedSizeChanged().

        2. Unsigned integer overflow -- which can happen if the new allocated memory
           size plus the currentSize exceeds the maximum of unsigned.
           This can be seen in MemoryCache::adjustSize() where we add delta to m_liveSize
           or m_deadSize without checking whether this addition will overflow or not. We
           do not assert for overflow although we assert for underflow.
           
        The fix for these two problems can be the following:
        
        1. Make all the adjustSize functions all the way till MemoryCache::adjustSize()
           take a signed long integer argument.
           
        2. Do not create a NativeImagePtr for an ImageFrame if its frameBytes plus the
           ImageFrameCache::decodedSize() will exceed the maximum of an unsigned integer.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When we are parsing the up to 4 numbers in an IPv4 address, if we find a syntax violation 
        (the canonicalized address would be different than the input string) then wait to report
        it until we have determined that this is a valid IPv4 address that will be canonicalized.
        If it is not a valid IPv4 address, then we will just treat the characters as the host, and
        that could be no syntax violation.

        URLParser should ignore tabs at all possible locations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162711

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The URL spec says to remove all tabs and newlines before parsing a URL.
        To reduce passes on the URL and copies of data, I chose to just ignore them every time I increment the iterator.
        This is fragile, but faster.  It can be completely tested, though.  That is what this patch does.

        Covered by an addition to the API tests that tries inserting one tab at each location of each test.

        RenderSVGRoot::nodeAtPoint() needs to test for both the HitTestBlockBackground and

        Drop first 'state' parameter to JSDOMWindow::toWrapped() / JSEventTarget::toWrapped()
        as it is unused. This is the quickest way to allow DOMWindow / EventTarget members
        in IDL dictionaries. This is because the generated bindings code relies on
        convertWrapperType() in JSDOMConvert.h which calls toWrapped() with a single
        parameter. Right now, the only type that requires an ExecState for its toWrapped()
        is XPathNSResolver (which should likely be a callback interface rather than a

        DOMTokenList’s value and stringifier should not return parsed tokens

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Updated our implementation of DOMTokenList.prototype.value and its toString function
        to match the latest DOM specification: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-domtokenlist

        "value" attribute, on getting, runs its serialize steps, which simply gets the attribute value.
        On setting, it sets the attribute value with the given value.

        The stringification behavior returns the same serialize steps as "value" attribute on getting.

        This change simplifies our implementation of DOMTokenList and removes the need for m_cachedValue,
        which has been removed in this patch.

        [MSE][Mac] In SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::abort(), support reseting parser to the last appended initialization segment.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135164

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-abort-resets-parser.html

        Use the -[AVStreamDataParser appendStreamData:withFlags:] to implement "resetting" the parser. In this case,
        the parser isn't explicitly reset during resetParserState(), but rather a flag is set so that the next append
        signals a data discontinuity, and the parser is reset at that point.

        Because a previous append operation may be in-flight during this abort(), care must be taken to invalidate any
        operations which may have already started on a background thread. So SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC will use a
        separate WeakPtrFactory for its append operations, will invalidate any outstanding WeakPtrs during an abort(),
        and will block until the previous append() operation completes.

        This will require the WebAVStreamDataParserListener object to occasionally have it's WeakPtr pointing back to the
        SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC to be reset after an abort(), so make that ivar an @property. Rather than passing a
        RetainPtr to itself in all the callbacks it handles, the WebAVStreamDataParserListener can just pass in a copy
        of its own WeakPtr (which may be invalidated during an abort()).

        Break the distinct operations of "abort()" and "resetParserState()" into their own methods in SourceBufferPrivate
        and all its subclasses.

        Reviewed by Youenn Fablet.

        Added support for the serializer special operation for WebIDLs,
        current implementation adds support for:
          - just the keyword: serializer; It will return all the
            attributes of in an object.
          - map of entries with the attributes: serializer = {attribute1,
            attribute2, ...}

        It creates a toJSON method that returns the serialized value
        converted into an ECMAScript value. For more information check the
        definition of the operation:

        http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-serializers

        We have created a new function in the API of the objects
        that are marked as serializer.

        Used the support to add new API for RTCIceCandidate and
        RTCSessionDescription.

        Move caching the ImageFrame from BitmapImage to ImageSource
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155498

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        BitmapImage has two modes of operation regarding its image decoding state.
        The first mode happens when a remote image is loaded as encoded data and
        which requires an ImageDecoder to generate the image metadata and the
        the ImageFrames. The second mode happens when a BitmapImage is created
        with a NativeImagePtr. In this case, no ImageDecoder is needed.

        To remove this burden from the BitmapImage the member 'm_frames' is removed
        from BitmapImage. A new member named 'm_frameCache' of type ImageFrameCache
        is added to ImageSource. This class handles caching and recaching the image
        metadata and the ImageFrames if the image needs decoding. When the BitmapImage
        is initialized with a memory image, the ImageFrameCache initializes its
        metadata and ImageFrames directly from the NativeImagePtr.

        The plan for ImageFrameCache is to be extended for the asynchronous image
        decoding and also to be used by the non CG image decoders which cache
        other copies of the ImageFrames. This double caching should be removed.

        When the BitmapImage is replying to the ImageFrame queries, it will ask the
        ImageSource which will pass the query the ImageFrameCache. ImageFrameCache
        will ensure the requested ImageFrame is cached and is valid for the requested
        SubSamplingLevel before accessing the data members of this ImageFrame.

        It should be possible to dispatch events on documents that do not have a browsing
        context (e.g. Documents created using DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument()).
        Gecko and Blink both allow this but WebKit did not.

        The approach chosen to support this is similar to the one in Blink. When constructing
        a new document (e.g. using DOMImplementation.createHTMLDocument()) we now keep track
        of the context document. When requesting the scriptExecutionContext(), we now return
        the context document if the document has one instead of the document itself.

        Implement URLParser::syntaxViolation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162593

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Most of the time when parsing URLs, we just look at the URL, find offsets of the host, path, query, etc., 
        and the String can be used untouched.  When this happens, we do not want to allocate and copy the String.
        We want to just add a reference to an existing String.

        Sometimes we need to canonicalize the String because there has been a syntaxViolation,
        defined as any String that is different than its canonicalized URL String.  In such cases we need to
        allocate a new String and fill it with the canonicalized URL String.  When a syntaxViolation happens for the
        first time, we know that everything in the input String up to that point is equal to what it would have been
        if we had canonicalized the beginning of the URL, copy it into a buffer, and continue parsing in a mode where
        instead of just looking at the input URL String, we canonicalize each code point into the buffer.

        Changes to behavior involve additional spec compliance with tabs and newlines in different places in URLs,
        as well as additional spec compliance when parsing empty and null URLs relative to other URLs.
        Both are covered by new API tests. Existing behavior covered by existing API tests.

        This is about a 15% speed improvement on my URL parsing benchmark.

        Tweaks the main content media heuristic for better Now Playing behavior on YouTube by making the following
        changes:
        - Remove the strict requirement for audio to be actively playing for the session to be able to show
          controls for the purpose of Now Playing, making it the same as our policy for the controls manager.
        - Make playback requirement restrictions apply only for the controls manager. Videos that do not
          autoplay will still have the correct behavior with respect to Now Playing, since we will bail in the
          hasEverNotifiedAboutPlaying() check.
        - Only consider the main content heuristic as preventing media controls from showing up for the purposes
          of the controls manager. Now Playing should instead account for this by preferring elements large
          enough for main content after collecting all of the candidate sessions.

        Second parameter to MutationObserver.observe() should be optional:
        - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-mutationobserver

        Firefox agrees with the specification. There is no real behavior change
        except that MutationObserver.prototype.observe.length is now 1 instead
        of 2. Passing only one parameter will still throw a TypeError because
        the Dictionary is empty. However, this parameter needs to be marked as
        optional because Web IDL requires the last parameter to be optional if
        it is a Dictionary.

        No new tests, rebaselined existing test.

        should not show controls, since we relax audio and video constraints for showing videos in the controls manager,
        so that a video element is prevented from showing controls on grounds of lacking audio only if it has never had
        audio before. In the case of Now Playing, we have stricter requirements for videos, which must have audio, which
        makes the mainframe heuristic not necessary.

        There is a bug in ComposedTreeIterator. If the iterator is initialized with an initial state where the root
        is inside a shadow tree it won't iterate into slots.

        If an input element is in a shadow tree it generates narrowly scoped style updates. When RenderTreeUpdater
        applies such an update the update root will be inside the shadow tree and the bug will prevent the render tree
        for slotted content from updating.

        Seeking video doesn't update seek position
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162575
        <rdar://problem/28457219>

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        On ToT, seeking in a video causes the playhead to stutter, and does not actually update media remote's seek
        position. This is partly due to how we do not update media remote with new information when beginning to respond
        to remote seek commands, so media remote continues to think that a playing video is still playing despite the
        user attempting to seek through it.

        To fix this, we introduce timer-based guards around remote seek commands, such that a seek "gesture" begins when
        we receive the first seek command and ends when no seek command has been received in a set amount of time (this
        is 0.5 seconds, which is approximately what other clients around the platform use).

        Also, when responding to a remote seek, perform the seek with no tolerance. This prevents the playhead from
        stuttering at the end of a seek from the final requested destination of the seek to the last actually seeked
        time in the video.

        When beginning to seek, we must pause the media. Through existing mechanisms, this causes the media session
        manager to update its Now Playing information, which informs media remote that we are no longer playing and
        prevents us from stuttering. However, when ending a seek, we must also trigger an additional update to again
        refresh media remote's view of the current time. This prevents a flicker when playing media after seeking.

        Unit tests to be added in a follow-up due to time constraints.
