        Let the parser yield for layout before running scripts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54355

        Prior to this patch, the parser would yield to perform a layout/paint before running a
        script only if the script or a stylesheet blocking the script is not loaded yet. Since we
        don't preload scan into the body while parsing the head, typically we'll block on a script
        early in the body that causes us to yield to do the first paint within a reasonable time.

        However, I'm planning to change the PreloadScanner to scan into the body from the head.
        That significantly improves overall load time, but would hurt first paint time because
        fewer scripts would be blocked during parsing and thus wouldn't yield.

        This change causes us to yield before running scripts if we haven't painted yet (regardless
        of whether or not the script is loaded). In addition to allowing the above mentioned
        PreloadScanner change to be implemented without regressing first paint time, this also
        improves first paint time by itself.

        I tested Alexa's top 45 websites using Web Page Replay to control the content and simulate
        bandwidth. This patch improved average first paint time by 1% over an unlimited connection,
        6% over a 1Mbps connection and 11% over a 5Mbps connection. There was no statistically
        signifcant change in page load time.

        Within the pages tested, 33 had no statistically significant change in time to first paint,
        12 improved, and none regressed. Of the improved, some of the standouts from the 1Mbps set
        are: 20% on youtube, 37% on wiki, 27% on ebay, 13% on cnn, 16% on espn, 74% on sohu.

        [chromium] Update texture for ContentLayerChromiums in draw() call instead of updateContents..() call
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54315

        This defers all operations on the compositor's GL context until the
        draw() call which is a prerequisite for moving the draw() off-thread.
        Also cleans up the update cycle a bit - there were some unused local
        variables and whatnot.

        One consequence of this change is that the upload buffer is retained
        across updates now instead of allocated by each paint.  This is
        necessary so that the full layer contents can be uploaded if the
        texture manager evicts the layer's backing texture.  This costs more
        persistent memory but avoids lots of allocator churn on updates.
        Another nonobvious detail is that I have to update the texture for
        ContentLayerChromiums in bindContentsTexture() because mask layers
        never draw(), they are instead bound to the secondary texture unit.

        Add support for dir=auto
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50916

        When an element has dir attribute with value "auto", call defaultWritingMode
        to find its directionality.
        Added a flag SelfOrAncestorHasDirAutoFlag, and added hooks in the DOM to set
        and check this flag. This flag is set on every node between an element with
        dir=auto attribute and its first text node. Changes in the DOM between those
        elements will trigger re-evaluating the directionality, but changes not
        between those element do not need to be concerned.
        The DOM hooks were added to childrenChanged, and to parseMappedAttribute.
        The directionality is evaluated when children are added, and cleared when they are
        removed. Directionality flag is also cleared on a child that is no longer determining
        the directionality due to a sibling being added before that child.

        Added 2 static CSSMutableStyleDeclarations to be used for elements with dir=auto.
        We cannot used the mapped declaration, because it can take only one value.

        Bug 53940: Implement the OES_vertex_array_object WebGL extension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53940

        Initial implementation of the OES_vertex_array_object extension adding the OESVertexArrayObject
        extension container and WebGLVertexArrayObjectOES VAO object. The extension is plumbed through
        the Extensions3D interface and implemented in the Extensions3DOpenGL (WebKit/OSX) version when
        it is available.
        Two big changes touching code outside of the extension files:
        * Moved the typedefs at the top of GraphicsContext3D.h to GraphicsTypes3D.h (modeled after
          GraphicsTypes.h). They are not namespaced as they weren't before.
        * To make the code cleaner/clearer all vertex attribute state has been moved to the
          WebGLVertexArrayObjectOES type (struct VertexAttribState) except for values which are still
          on the WebGLRenderingContext. A default VAO is now used to store the existing attribute
          states for when no other VAO is used. Code in WebGLRenderingContext dealing with buffers and
          vertex attributes now defers to or stores values in the bound array object.

        Tested against the WebGL conformance suite and the new
        oes-vertex-array-object test:

        Web Inspector: reflect changes to styles when they happen outside inspector.

        Notify InspectorInstrumentation of inline style changes from CSSMutableStyleDeclaration
        whenever the style change does not come from a direct "style" attribute modification.
        The performance regression occurs only with the Web Inspector opened, when inline styles
        are modified through setting style.cssText or style.<styleAttribute>: according to the Web Inspector protocol,
        an attribute change requires that all attributes for the node in question be pushed into the frontend.

        Refactor pumpTokenizer loop

        1. This makes pumpTokenizer() safe to call when waiting for a script or when about to get
           the next token, although ASSERTs still enforce that we aren't waiting for a script. This
           enables resumeParsingAfterYield() to call pumpTokenizer with no modifications even if we
           yield before running a script rather than before taking a token (see bug 54355).
        2. This also picks up the refCount >= 1 assert when stopped.

        Tested PerformanceTests/Parser to verify no regression. If anything it got faster.

        Add support for GPU accelerated path rendering
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44729

        Incorporates the Loop and Blinn path rendering algorithm as an
        option to the GPU-accelerated canvas code, currently only compiled
        in to the Chromium port. Currently it's toggled by changing a
        hardcoded constant in
        SharedGraphicsContext3D::useLoopBlinnForPathRendering() and is
        disabled by default. This mechanism can be improved once we've
        gained more confidence in the implementation. There are some known
        bugs that need to be fixed first.

        No new tests; ran some 2D Canvas tests manually with the new flag
        both enabled and disabled.

        Convert the line box tree to floating point and eliminate font rounding hacks.  This patch removes all of the rounding
        hacks from the Font code and makes sure all Font APIs involving width measurement and width offsets use floats.
        
        The line box tree's x, y and logicalWidth members have all been converted to floats and all of the line box APIs have
        been changed as well.
        
        In terms of pixel adjustments, overflow is using an enclosing model (so it will be enclosingIntRect of a line box's x/y/width/height).
        
        Background and border painting is using a rounding model, so borders and backgrounds will round to the nearest pixel when painting.
        
        Replaced elements still snap to integer positions on lines, and they use a rounding model as well, although their underlying line boxes
        still have a precise floating point position.

        Justification will now allow subpixel positioning to occur as well.  Platforms that don't support subpixel positioning should already
        be rounding justification spacing in their font code.

        Many layout test results change on Mac, since rounding hacks were used there and are now gone.

        Remove the early bail added in r75823 since we can run into anonymous
        blocks when traversing the parents chain for clearing floats.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54601

        removeFloatingOrPositionedChildFromBlockLists tries to find the topmost
        parent containing "this" block and then tries to remove it from its floats
        list and mark all descendants blocks for layout. I added a bailout condition
        in r75823 because we thought that if one of the parent render block does not 
        contain "this" float, then it is safe to assume that none of the grand parents
        will have it. This is a wrong assumption since anonymous blocks do not have
        float objects and we need to go higher in the chain to find the top most parent
        containing this float. Instead of breaking out of the loop, it is ok to keep
        traversing the chain till we find that parent. Otherwise, we will leave deleted
        floats in the grand parents floats list.
