            Remove invalid float from RootInlineBox.

            Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

            In certain cases, floating boxes get attached to the last (root) inline box.
            When this particular floating box gets destroyed, it also needs to be detached
            from the last inline box.
            1. Introduce RootInlineBox::removeFloat() (vs. RootInlineBox::appendFloat())
            2. Ensure that it is called when the floating box is being destroyed.

            However, when a multicolumn element with flow-from style dynamically loses
            its multicolumn style while keeping the flow-from style, we have to transform
            the element into a region by detaching and attaching the associated DOM node,
            in the same way we are proceeding when an element receives a different flow-from style.

            the start and end points of selection is cached in RenderView. However, since

            it is possible that the cached end-points of the original selection are not included
            in any of the resulting subtree selection and they are not marked accordingly.
            In order to process the selection clearing correctly, we have to take the original

            ResourceHandleCFURLConnectionDelegateWithOperationQueue needs to signal threads waiting on
            its semaphore when the handle is being destroyed. Otherwise, we can leave dispatch threads
            hanging around waiting for a response. This can happen when the Web Content process dies.
            Any thread/queue waiting on a response from that web process will leak and stay around
            forever. If we reach the dispatch queue limit of 64, then all networking will cease to
            happen in the Networking process. Fix this by signalling waiting threads and clearing out
            our state in much the same way that -[WebCoreResourceHandleAsOperationQueueDelegate

            (WebCore::ScrollView::visibleContentRectInternal):
            When converting coordinates from the main frame to a subframe's document, the position
            is first converted to the subframe's FrameView coordinate system, then offset by the scroll
            offset of the subframe itself.

            The bug in this case was that the scroll offset used was the global scroll offset of the frame
            in the view instead of the scroll offset of the document in its own frameview.

            The regression was introduced by the refactoring r162663. On iOS WebKit1, the coordinate system
            is different depending on VisibleContentRectIncludesScrollbars. In r162663, the value was set
            such that the rect returned is always in absolute coordinate.

            The ideal solution would be to refactor ScrollView::platformVisibleContentRect() to always return
            the offsets in scroll view coordinates and verify and update all the call sites to use explicit
            conversion to the top frame. In this patch I only reverted the coordinate change of r162663 to avoid
            large scale impact.

            RootInlineBox::verticalPositionForBox() had some implicit conversions between
            LayoutUnit and int that caused overflow, and resulted in different comparison
            behavior with an int constant in different architectures, since overflow behavior
            is undefined.
        
            Specifically, VerticalPositionCache was written in terms of ints with a special
            0x80000000 "not found" value. However, 0x80000000 was being assigned to
            a LayoutUnit, which multiplies by 64 causing overflow. The result was then
            compared again with 0x80000000 which could pass or fail depending on overflow
            behavior.
        
            Fix by converting VerticalPositionCache to use LayoutUnits, and to have a bool
            return value with a result out param, instead of a special return value.

            Not easily testable, since the difference does not show in DRT output,
            and a ref test would be flakey.

            Fixes an issue where gmail.com may fail to load the list of messages. In particular, a SQLTransactionCallback

            will subsequently display an error message.
    
            When a WebKit client defers loading of a page (e.g. -[WebView setDefersCallbacks:YES]), WebCore
            may still load the main resource, say if substitute data is available for it, and defer executing
            tasks, such as a SQLTransactionCallback function, by appending such tasks to the end of the list
            of pending tasks for the associated Document. This list of pending tasks is never processed when
            a client subsequently allows loading (e.g. -[WebView setDefersCallbacks:NO])). Therefore, we never
            execute a SQLTransactionCallback function that was deferred.
    
            Ideally WebCore would defer loading of substitute data when a WebKit client requests that loading
            be deferred and hence a SQLTransactionCallback function would be deferred as a consequence of the
            lack of JavaScript script execution (since substitute data wasn't loaded and hence any JavaScript
            script contained in the substitute data that initiates a SQL transaction isn't executed). For now,
            it's sufficient to only defer executing tasks when either there are existing pending tasks or the
            page defers loading and active DOM objects in the document are suspended (e.g. Document::suspendActiveDOMObjects() was called).

            In r168119 I avoided creating backing store for backface-visibility:hidden unless
            some ancestor was 3d-transformed. However, when starting transitions or animations
            that apply transforms, we don't do a layout, and therefore don't update the RenderLayer
            flags that mark an ancestor as having a transform. This broke various content which
            used backface-visibility:hidden for "flip" animations.
            
            Make a low-risk fix that looks for the pattern of CSS properties used for flipping,
            making a compositing layer for backface-visibility:hidden if the stacking context element
            has transform-style: preserve-3d.

            In r170198 I added an "orphan scrolling nodes" code path that sets aside subtrees
            of scrolling nodes into an m_orphanedSubframeNodes map, which keeps them alive until
            they get reparented or destroyed. The nodes in that subtree remain in m_stateNodeMap,
            which holds raw pointers to them.
            
            However, ScrollingStateTree::commit() can clear m_orphanedSubframeNodes, which is
            sometimes non-empty at this point. When that happened, we would destroy nodes which
            were still referenced by m_stateNodeMap, with the result that a later query for the
            same nodeID would hand back a pointer to a deleted object.
            
            Fix by calling recursiveNodeWillBeRemoved() on nodes in the m_orphanedSubframeNodes
            before clearing it, which removes them and all their descendants from the state node map.

            r171526 broke the case where we have a memory mapped file from the DiskImageCache in the
            SharedBuffer. In such a case, m_buffer is empty and createCFData() returned an
            WebCoreSharedBufferData with an empty buffer.
    
            Fix this by taking the easy route of bringing back the old code for the disk image cache
            file backed case. In the long run we probably want to remove the iOS specific disk image
            cache anyway.
    
            Review also uncovered another bug in r171526 where we were balancing an Objective-C alloc
            with a CFRelease which is incorrect when running under GC. Fix that by using adoptNS along
            with adoptCF which is what the code did before.
    
            No new tests because the bug only occurs on device and we can't run tests on device yet.

            Fixes an issue where accessing local storage for the first time after calling window.close()
            causes a crash.
    
            For now, we should disallow accessing local storage after calling window.close() regardless of
            whether it's the first access to local storage as this seems like a bad idiom to support. Note,
            this represents a change in behavior from WebKit1. If such usage of window.localStorage turns
            out to be reasonable then we can visit this decision again in <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135330>.

            Add a flag on Document, m_hasPreparedForDestruction, which ensures
            that each Document only goes through prepareForDestruction() once.
            prepareForDestruction() can be called a number of times during teardown,
            but it's only necessary to actually execute it once.
            
            This was previously achieved by virtue of all callers of prepareForDestruction()
            first checking hasLivingRenderTree, and prepareForDestruction() tearing down
            the render tree, but that meant that prepareForDestruction() was not called
            for Documents who never had a render tree in the first place.
    
            The only part of prepareForDestruction() that is now predicated on hasLivingRenderTree()
            is the call to destroyRenderTree(); the rest of the function has the potential to be relevant
            for non-rendered placeholder documents and can safely deal with them in other ways.
    
            It is important to call prepareForDestruction() on non-rendered placeholder documents
            because some of the cleanup (like disconnectFromFrame()) is critical to safe destruction.

            While calculating the rounded rect for painting, the radius is adjusted to compensate
            for the pixel snapped size. However while scaling the radius, certain values overflow
            (float) mantissa and it produces a non-renderable rounded rect where the radius becomes bigger
            than the rectangle dimensions. In such cases, we need to shrink the radius to make it
            renderable again.

            SharedBuffer::createCFData() calls data() as a way to coalesce the data array elements and
            segments into m_buffer. However, data() has an optimization where if we had a single element
            in the data array, it would just return that and not do coalescing. So when we passed
            m_buffer to WebCoreSharedData, we passed a buffer with no data in it.

            Fix this by bringing the optimization to createCFData() and return the CFDataRef from the
            data array if we just have a single element.

            The bug was caused by editorUIUpdateTimerFired calling respondToChangedSelection only if the selection was

            Sharing SharedBuffer between WebCore and ImageIO is racy and crash prone
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135069
            <rdar://problem/17470655>

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            When passing image data to ImageIO for decoding, we pass an NSData subclass that is a wraper
            around SharedBuffer. This can be a problem when ImageIO tries to access the data on the CA
            thread. End result is data corruption on large image loads and potential crashes. The fix is
            to have SharedBuffer create a copy of its data if the data has been passed to ImageIO and
            might be accessed concurrently.

            Since Vector is not refcounted, we do this by having a new refcounted object in SharedBuffer
            that contains the buffer and we pass that in our NSData subclass WebCoreSharedBufferData.
            Code that would result in the Vector memory moving e.g. append(), resize(), now checks to
            see if the buffer was shared and if so, will create a new copy of the vector. This ensures
            that the main thread does not end up invalidating the vector memory that we have passed it
            to ImageIO.

            No new tests because no functional changes.

            The "webkit" property on the window was not getting installed for subsequent

            [MSE] YouTube video decode error when variant-switching
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135128

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            Test: media/media-source/media-source-overlapping-decodetime.html

            When variant-switching, the situation can arise where an existing sample with a presentation
            timestamp of N and a decode timestamp of M, and a new sample with a presentation timestamp > N
            and the same decode timestamp of M, will keep the new sample from being added to the SampleMap.
            This can result in a decode error when samples depending on that new, missing sample are enqueued.

            The MSE spec is silent on the issue of overlapping decode timestamps. However, it guarantees that
            presentation timestamps are non-overlapping. So instead of using just the decode timestamp as a key
            for storing the samples in decode order, use both the decode timestamp and the presentation timestamp.
            That ensures that samples with different presentation times but equal decode times are both inserted
            into the decode queue, and in the correct order.

            (WebCore::SampleIsRandomAccess::operator()): Update the parameter type to match the new KeyType.

            We currently pass a SharedBuffer wrapped in WebCoreSharedBufferData to ImageIO for image
            decoding. This is not thread safe since ImageIO will access this buffer on a separate
            thread. We access SharedBuffer::buffer() on the other thread which resizes the Vector
            m_buffer if m_size is greater than the vector size. Since the code in SharedBuffer::append()
            sets m_size before appending the data to the buffer, m_size is out of sync with the m_buffer
            size for the entire duration of the Vector append which could be doing a lot of copying if
            the resource is large. While this change does not fix the race condition, we can at least
            reduce the chances of SharedBuffer::buffer() calling resize() by setting m_size after the
            cector has finished appending.

            When the UI-side scrolling tree receives a requested scroll position update, it scrolls
            the node (e.g. a frame) then traverses child nodes to update them, e.g. for fixed position.
            However, we would always use a viewport rect for the main document (from the scrolling tree),
            which is not appropriate for subframes. Subframes should just use their own visible
            rect to position fixed children.

        This patch drops the outdated 'script-nonce' Content Security
        Policy directive. It was removed from the spec, and replaced in

        instead.

        Until then, removing the outdated syntax will ensure that no one
        ends up relying on it in WebKit's implementation.

        This should have limited web-visible impact, as the feature is

        <rdar://problem/16088789>

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        When individual elements inside an overflow:scroll with -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch
        had touch event listeners, we would fail to take the scroll offset into account when
        building the touch event region, causing touches on those elements to fail after scrolling.
        
        Touch event region building uses RenderObject::absoluteClippedOverflowRect(), and that
        code path tries to fix up repaint rects to work correctly in composited overflow:scroll.
        However, that broke the touch region computation.
        
        Fix by only ignoring the scroll offset for calls to computeRectForRepaint() which
        have a non-null repaintContainer (which indicates that we're doing a repaint in the
        compositing layer), and for which the repaintContainer is the containing block
        which is using composited scrolling. This restores correct behavior to the event region
        code which always calls this with a null repaintContainer.

        This patch implements sparse mode for auto-placement algorithm, which is
        the default mode in the new grid-auto-flow syntax. It keeps track of the
        auto-placement cursor in
        RenderGrid::placeAutoMajorAxisItemsOnGrid() and updates it accordingly
        when auto-positioned items are placed.
        If we're in dense mode it resets the cursor after each item (which keeps
        the old behavior that was using dense mode by default).

        GridIterator has been adapted to look for empty areas from a given

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The paginatedAndComposited bit being set in updateLayerPositions just didn't work, since compositing states
        can change without triggering that function. This patch just gets rid of the bit and does a crawl every time
        to check. This ensures that changes in compositing states don't necessitate any changes in pagination,
        since the lookup will always check the current compositing state.
        
        The new function that does this check is hasCompositedLayerInEnclosingPaginationChain.

        * css/SelectorChecker.cpp:
        (WebCore::SelectorChecker::matchRecursively):
        The condition of this if() branch can never be met for the mode "QueryingRules".

        The next condition in that if() is "dynamicPseudo != NOPSEUDO", which implies
        a pseudo element was matched prior to the current context/simple selector.
        This cannot happen with QueryingRules, since we never match pseudo elements for
        SelectorQuery.

        Elements with rendering disabled due to dimensions should not contribute to parent bounding box
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134184

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        SVG elements that have rendering disabled should not contribute to any ancestor elements bounding box.
        Examples of elements with rendering disabled:
        - basic shape with width <= 0 or height <= 0
        - path with no path data (d attribute missing or empty)
        - polyline or polygon element with no point data (points attribute missing or empty)

        To achieve this a method (isRenderingDisabled) was added to RenderSVGShape and it's derived classes.
        This is used to determine if an element is included when creating the union of child bounding boxes
        in a container element.

        Unlike containsUncommonAttributeSelector(), selectorListContainsUncommonAttributeSelector() does not
        evaluate the attribute for "uncommon" types.

        It would be possible to change the function instead to evaluate common attributes based
        on the match type and the pseudo class type. Such change would be more risky
        and we would get very little benefit from it, I leave that for later if that ever becomes useful.

        http/tests/media/media-source/mediasource-duration.html
        http/tests/media/media-source/mediasource-play.html

        The primary change necessary to fix the mediasource-duration.html test was to add support
        for delaying the completion of a seek operation until the HTMLMediaElement's readyState
        rises to > HAVE_CURRENT_DATA. This is accomplished by modifying MediaSourcePrivate to have
        waitForSeekCompleted() and seekCompleted() virtual methods. These are called by MediaSource
        when a seek operation results in the current time moving outside the currently buffered time
        ranges, and when an append operation results in the readyState changing, respectively.

        A number of other drive-by fixes were necessary to get this test fully passing, as noted
        below.

        Make the MediaSource the primary owner of the media's duration, rather than the MediaSourcePrivate.
        Move the MediaSourcePrivateClient pointer to the MediaSourcePrivate from the MediaPlayerPrivate, so
        the MediaSource's duration can be retrieved.  While we're at it, do the same thing for buffered.

        If a filter with high specificity is found, we add the rule immediately and end there.
        If a filter that is not very specific is found, we keep a pointer to the selector to use it later.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Update grid-auto-flow to the new syntax
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134057

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        In last versions of the spec grid-auto-flow syntax has changed. New
        syntax is:
        [ row | column ] && dense? | stack && [ row | column ]?

        Implemented parsing for new syntax and added/modified test cases in
        current layout tests.

        For the moment, the implementation keeps working in the same way, but
        using "stack" value for grid-auto-flow property instead of "none". This
        should be fixed in a follow-up patch once "stack" is properly
        implemented.

        Also "dense" needs to be reviewed. Right now auto-placement algorithm is
        always "dense" and never "sparse".

        No new tests, update current tests to add new cases.

        [MSE] Overlapping appended ranges must cause the decoder to flush and re-enqueue.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134805

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        When appending a range of media data which overlaps with an existing range, SourceBuffer
        must cause the decoder to flush and re-enqueue samples. Those samples removed by appending
        the overlapping range may have already been enqueued for display, and unless the decode
        queue is flushed, corruption or decode errors may occur as the new samples are enqueued for
        display.

        Add a boolean flag onto TrackBuffer to indicate whether the decoder needs to be flushed and
        re-enqueued the next time an append operation completes. Set this flag whenever samples are
        removed due to overlapping or an explicit call to removeCodedFrames(). Move the contents of
        sourceBufferPrivateSeekToTime() (which previously did flushing and re-enqueueing) into a new
        function, reenqueueMediaForTime(), which can be called from sourceBufferPrivateAppendComplete().

        Drive-by fix: findSyncSampleAfterDecodeIterator() would return the passed in iterator if that
        sample is a sync-sample. Fix this to correctly return the next sync sample.

        Drive-by fix: Use a SampleMap, rather than a DecodeOrderSampleMap, to track erased samples

        [Curl] Cache entry invalidated too early.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134681

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        When a cache entry has expired, it is invalidated when a request for the corresponding url is started.
        This is too early, since the resource is possibly not modified (even though it has expired),
        and the server might respond with a 304 (not modified) response.
        When we then receive a 304 response, the cache entry is deleted, and we have no cached response/data to provide.
        This can be solved by not invalidating the entry when a request for that url is started,
        but instead invalidate when a 200 OK response is received (which means the resource has been modified).

        CSS canvas color parsing accepts invalid color identifiers

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Current implementation of the CSSParser::parseSystemColor assumes
        that if a valid cssValueKeywordID is got then it has to be a valid
        color. Such assumption is wrong and lead to many bugs and layout
        test failures.

        The parseSystemFunction determines now whether the parsed color is
        valid or not.

        Addtionally, a new method has been added to share the logic of
        determining whether a CSSValueID is a valid primitive values for
        colors or not. Generally, we should avoid passing invalid color
        identifiers to the theming API.

        [iOS] caption size is sometimes incorrect in fullscreen
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134740

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        Captions on iOS are displayed in fullscreen with a TextTrackRepresentation object. Because
        the fullscreen video presentation is controlled by code in the UI process running on the
        UI thread, WebCore is notified of changes to fullscreen state asynchronously. This resulted
        in the TextTrackRepresentation object being created and/or destroyed too late some of the 
        time, which caused us to sometimes display captions incorrectly. Fix this by setting up and
        tearing down the TextTrackRepresentation object when WebCore's 'webkitfullscreenchange'
        event fires.

        Ensure we compute the height of replaced elements to 'auto' when appropriate.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134700

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This fixes two issues:

        1) If a replaced element has a percentage height specified then its
        height should compute to 'auto' when its containing block does not
        have a height 'specified explicitly'. We were taking this to mean when
        its containing block's specified height value is 'auto' - in fact it
        means when the containing block's computed height is auto.

        2) Top and bottom on the containing block should only affect the
        height of the block if that block has absolute or fixed position.

        This brings us into line with IE, Firefox, and Chrome.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch removes 2 integral roundings from InlineFlowBox:
        1. Border and padding sizes are implicitly integral truncated by the 'int' return type
           of borderLogicalLeft/Right()/paddingLogicalLeft/Right(). It results in losing
           fractional border/padding values.
        2. Painting rectangle is explicitly rounded which pushes border and
           other decoration elements to odd device pixel positions on retina displays.
        These values get pixel snapped right before calling in to GraphicsContext::*.

        In r170572 I attempted to prevent the page zoom from happening
        when the user was attempting to fullscreen the video. That fix was
        not complete, because it relied on the touchstart event being
        sent before a gesture event. It turns out this doesn't always happen,
        so we need to apply the same check in the gesture event - if the
        gesture began with two fingers on the media, don't do a page zoom.
        The exception is zooming out, if you've managed to make the video
        cover the entire screen (also, the pinch-out-of-fullscreen gesture
        does not get handled by WebKit).

        New test: platform/mac/fast/scrolling/scroll-iframe-fragment.html

        WK1 scrollable areas are implemented on top of PlatformWidget (i.e., NSView) objects. They only
        perform a scroll operation if the EventHandler::handleWheelEvent method returns 'false', indicating
        that the Cocoa layer should do scrolling work. This is in contrast to WK2, where the scrolling is
        handled separately and we return 'true' from EventHandler::handleWheelEvent to indicate that the
        scroll event has been handled and that no other work is needed. This mismatch in the meaning of
        EventHandler::handleWheelEvent means that WK1 views do not properly handle scroll wheel events.

        To correct this, we need to see if we are acting on an Element backed by a PlatformWidget. When we
        are (the WK1 case) we want to return 'false' to instruct the Cocoa object to do the scroll operation.
        To implement proper latching behavior in WK1, we must return 'true' in the case where we are latched
        to a PlatformWidget, and that PlatformWidget did not start the scroll gesture at the edge of
        the region in the dominant scroll direction.

        Finally, additional logic was needed to determine whether the PlatformWidget is scrolled to the
        edge in the dominant scroll direction.

        Since WebCore::IconDatabase is not RefCounted there’s no obvious way to keep it alive until it is
        truly no longer needed.

        This isn’t generally a problem because they are usually a singleton that lasts the lifetime of the process.

        In the WebKit2 case, WebCore::IconDatabases can come and go as their owning WebIconDatabases come and go.

        <rdar://problem/17202021>

        This issue is caused by the order of teardown for RenderLayers.

        RenderLayer clears its m_backing in its destructor, calling the
        RenderLayerBacking destructor. The RenderLayerBacking destructor calls
        RenderLayerCompositor::willRemoveScrollingLayer(), which tries to
        access the RenderLayer's backing that has already been cleared. This
        causes us to skip the call to ChromeClient::removeScrollingLayer(),
        resulting in a stale view that can block touch events.

        Currently we always copy construct the captured std::function object when calling callOnMainThread()
        in the lambda function created in ScrollingThread::dispatchBarrier() because captured variables are
        const in a lambda expression's body by default. That is, the std::function object is captured as const.
        Instead, we should mark this lambda expression as mutable so the captured std::function object is
        non-const and hence we can use move semantics when passing it to callOnMainThread().

        The initial visibleRect is in the coordinate of the root layer, so its origin
        is at the top left of the view. The initial rect we were using doesn't
        include the contents inset, so it was too short, which was causing tiles near
        the bottom of the screen to not always be allocated if the tile threshold was
        close to the bottom of the view. Instead, we want to include the contents
        inset size so the visible rect includes the entire view.
        GraphicsLayerCA::recursiveCommitChanges() takes care of mapping and cropping
        the visible rect into the tiled layer's coordinate system, at which point it
        is used for visible tile logic.

        This patch adds support for HTMLImageElement's sizes attribute and the
        related srcset extended syntax as defined in
        http://picture.responsiveimages.org/.
        This sizes attribute syntax is added to the CSSGrammar and parsed by
        the CSSParser.
        The SourceSizeList class is generated by the parser, and used to get
        the final source size.
        HTMLImageElement and HTMLPreloadScanner send this value to
        HTMLSrcsetParser.
        HTMLSrcsetParser uses this value in order to pick the right resource.

        No need to lazily initialize ResourceResponse internals when accessing timing data.
        <https://webkit.org/b/134437>
        <rdar://problem/17499876>

        When building with ENABLE(WEB_TIMING), the last thing that would happen when
        serializing a ResourceResponse in the network process is that we'd retrieve
        the ResourceLoadTiming to encode it as part of the response. Doing so would
        trigger the lazy instantiation of ResourceResponse's internal data structures.

        Since timing data is not actually lazily instantiated, we can just not do that.

        This shaves off ~550ms of network process main thread time on PLT, reducing
        response latency by not doing unnecessary stuff before letting the web process
        look at the downloaded data.

        Remove BufferForAppendingHyphen
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134376

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        It is legacy, from a time when that code was using a Vector.

        The problem is that StringBuilder's memory was also implicitly used to keep
        the string alive for the lifespan of the TextRun. That seems quite dangerous
        as changes in StringBuilder could have changed that.

        To fix the lifetime issue, my first idea was to make it explicit by passing
        a String reference to hold the memory alive, and a boolean to say if the text
        need an hyphen. The problem with that is this code is very hot and I made things
        worse.

        The solution with this patch is to just pass a pointer to a String to do both
        the buffer reference, and the decision to add the hyphen. Having a single
        argument with 2 meanings is not pretty but that's not worse than the old buffer.

        [iOS WK2] Fix touch-scrollable elements with overflow:scroll on just one axis, and RTL scrolling

        Make -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch scrolling work correctly when one axis
        has overflow:scroll and the other overflow:hidden. Also fix scrolling in RTL
        contexts.
        
        An RTL scroller with overflow-x:hidden will have a non-zero scroll origin,
        and needs to truncate the scrolled content on the left side. To pass the
        correct geometry to the UI process, we need to introduce the concept of
        "reachable" size as well as total content size; normally these are the same,
        but will differ when scrolling is only allowed on one axis but there is overflow
        on both axes.
        
        To get the reachable size, add RenderLayer::scrollableContentsSize().
        
        RenderLayer::visibleSize() was wrong; the function should return the size of the 
        scrollable portion, but used layer size which includes borders. Fix to use pixelSnappedClientWidth()/Height(),
        which is what we use for scrollbar computations.

        [GTK] Expose getter and setter functions for attributes named type
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134300

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        We skip those because the getter conflicts with the get_type()
        function of all GObjects. We should use a different name for them. As
        a general rule we use the last word of the class name, something like:

          webkit_dom_blob_get_type() -> webkit_dom_blob_get_blob_type()
          webkit_dom_event_get_type() -> webkit_dom_event_get_event_type()

        It's consistent with other existing DOM methods like
        webkit_dom_xpath_result_get_result_type() or webkit_dom_css_value_get_css_value_type().
        This patch also adds some exceptions for particular cases.

        Skip memcmp()ing fully downloaded resources after they become mmap()able.
        <https://webkit.org/b/134362>

        When we receive word that a downloaded resource is now available for mmap()ing
        from the file system, we don't need to compare against the buffered data,
        since even if there were a mismatch, the cached version should be the canonical one.

        This was added as belt-and-suspenders while the supporting mechanism was being
        developed in CFNetwork, and there's no evidence of a race today. This change
        turns the runtime checks into debug-only assertions.

        Saves ~300ms of main thread time on PLT.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Properly support for z-index on grid items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103329

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        From Blink r157620 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org> and r172402 by
        <wangxianzhu@chromium.org>.

        The specification says that grid should match flexbox and force
        grid items to be stacking context if z-index is set, regardless
        of 'position'. After this change, this is what happens.

        Previously z-index changes of static positioned objects were ignored.
        However, z-index is applicable for some static positioned objects,
        such as grid items. Ignoring them makes the object not to be properly
        painted on z-index change.

        As StyleResolver has ensured that z-index is non-auto only if
        applicable, RenderStyle::changeRequiresLayerRepaint() should not check
        again (with inconsistent conditions).

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        If a given remote layer tree commit contains changes of layers for viewport-constrained
        objects, then the associated scrolling tree also needs to show that the layers changed,
        since we need to re-run the "viewport changed" logic in the UI process to get the
        layers correctly positioned for the current zoom level.
        
        The bug was that page scale changes resulted in small "pixel alignment" position
        changes which touched layers, but we didn't commit any scrolling tree changes. So
        the scrolling tree commit would result in visibly stale layer positions, with no scrolling tree
        update to adjust them for the current transient zoom.

        Fix by making use of the existing "alignment offset" field in the ViewportConstraints
        data, and having RemoteScrollingCoordinatorProxy::connectStateNodeLayers() note that
        fixed or sticky layers changed if any properties of fixed or sticky scrolling tree
        nodes were updated.

        relative to how much of the page is visible width-wise, the threshold being 2/3 of the page width.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        This crash appears to have been caused by http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/161276 
        which moved the ScrollingNode creation code from ScrollingTree over to 
        ScrollingCoordinator. This creates a thread safety issue. In the crashing case, we 
        believe that the ScrollingCoordinator's ScrollingTree pointer had been null-ed out
        even though the ScrollingTree was kept alive by the bind call to propagate 
        commitNewTreeState() over to the scrolling thread. The fix is to move node 
        creation back to the ScrollingTree and to use the this pointer to create new
        nodes rather than the ScrollingCoordinator's ScrollingTree pointer.

        Add all blend modes to feBlend

        feBlend should support all blend modes from CSS and Canvas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134296

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Add all blend modes to <feBlend> (the SVG filter primitive) that are also
        supported by HTML Canvas and CSS.

        In addition, add "normal" blend mode to HTML Canvas as requested by the
        CSS Compositing and Blending specification. (Referenced from HTML Canvas.)
        With this change, SVG, CSS and Canvas truly share the same blend modes and
        even the same keywords. This is much easier to for web authors.

        AX: Crash at com.apple.WebCore: WebCore::AlternativeTextController::removeDictationAlternativesForMarker + 43
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134226

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        Unchecked access of details pointer in the Document marker led to the crash.
        It seems erroneous to allow creation of a DocumentMarker without details when one is expected, because it
        carries the dictation context (not just the description).
        Also, add in ASSERTs to catch scenarios where a nullptr might be passed in.

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        As we are using WebKitDOM as a namespace we should unify all type macros
        to have WEBKIT_DOM_TYPE prefix instead of WEBKIT_TYPE_DOM. Also add
        more exceptions to decamelize function in GObject bindings generator
        to fix the names of bindings for BR, HR, UL, OL, DL and LI elements.

        Tiles on bottom of screen are not always allocated when necessary
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134272

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The initial visibleRect is in the coordinate of the root layer, so its origin
        is at the top left of the view. The initial rect we were using doesn't
        include the contents inset, so it was too short, which was causing tiles near
        the bottom of the screen to not always be allocated if the tile threshold was
        close to the bottom of the view. Instead, we want to include the contents
        inset size so the visible rect includes the entire view.
        GraphicsLayerCA::recursiveCommitChanges() takes care of mapping and cropping
        the visible rect into the tiled layer's coordinate system, at which point it
        is used for visible tile logic.

        InlineTextBox's m_len can be an unsigned (rather than an unsigned short)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134173

        Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

        After Zalan's talks with Kling, it seems that the simple line layout code
        might alleviate the need for the space savings in InlineTextBox. Given this,
        it would be beneficial to be a little more safe by using unsigneds throughout.

        For example, we have code like "void setLen(unsigned len) { m_len = len; }"
        which might silently break if given particular inputs.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        [Win] MSVC mishandles enums in bitfields
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134237

        Reviewed by Michael Saboff.

        Replace uses of enum types in bit fields with unsigned to
        avoid losing a bit to hold the sign value. This can result
        in Windows interpreting the value of the field improperly.

        HTMLMediaElement seek algorithm should allow cancelling previous seeks.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134116

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Test: media/video-seek-double.html

        Fulfill the requirement of the §4.7.14.9 seeking algorithm to do steps 5+ asynchronously and cancel
        previous instances of the algorithm.

        For the html/ parts of the algorithm, implement this by adding a seek timer, which when fired will
        issue steps 5-12. MediaPlayerPrivateAVFoundation will already coalesce multiple seek operations, so nothing
        additional needs be done there.  However, MediaPlayerPrivateMediaSourceAVFObjC needs to implement the same
        pending seek logic in case additional seeks were issued after the html/ algorithm reached step 12.

        (WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement): Initialize the new m_seekTimer.

        [iOS][WK2] Make the state restore from HistoryItem more precise and reliable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134150

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The two biggest changes for WebCore are:
        -Store everything we need to handle changes of ViewportConfiguration on HistoryItem.
        -Store the exposedRect with floating point coordinates.

        * WebCore.exp.in:
        * history/CachedPage.cpp:
        (WebCore::CachedPage::restore):
        We cannot determine a good scroll position from the WebProcess because the obscured insets can change
        arbitrarily in the UIProcess. When we scroll here from the WebProcess, we would force an invalid position
        to the UIProcess with the next layer tree update.

        To avoid any problem, we prohibit scrolling when restoring the focus appearance.

        In r169053 I moved some updateDrawsContent() into updateAfterDescendents(),
        but this isn't called when a composited layer gains or loses a mask (which
        doesn't cause a layout). This caused us to fail to allocate backing store
        when gaining a mask, resulting in missing content.
        
        Fix by calling updateAfterDescendents() from RenderLayer::styleChange()
        when the layer config isn't changing.
        
        Also remove a condition in isSimpleContainerCompositingLayer() that caused us
        to fall off the simple layer path for masked layers, since this works just
        fine.

        When an object flowed in multicol is moved from in-flow positioning to out-of-flow positioning,
        its information must be removed from the flowthread prior to the change being made.

        In order to support stretching of horizontal operators and large
        operators in display mode as well as to improve the drawing of radicals,
        we need to use an OpenType MATH table. This commit makes the MathML code
        try "Latin Modern Math" first, which is an OpenType version of Knuth's
        popular Computer Modern font and is packaged with most TeX
        distributions (e.g. TeX Live on Linux). This should work well on the
        EFL & GTK ports for which the initial OpenType MATH support has been

        Introduce RenderLayer::offsetFromAncestorLayer() to make convertToLayerCoords() calls with
        LayoutPoint(0, 0) as parameter more explicit.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134092

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Most of the RenderLayer::convertToLayerCoords() callers are only interested in
        the offset from the ancestor layer by passing LayoutPoint(0, 0) as the coordinate to convert.
        Introducing offsetFromAncestorLayer() makes those calls more explicit/self-explanatory.
        It helps simplifying the callsite's code.

        When nodes were detached from the scrolling tree, we would previously throw away
        all descendant nodes, expecting that they would be re-attached as we walk the compositing
        layer tree in RenderLayerCompositor.
        
        However, this doesn't work across frame boundaries; the subframe may never update
        its compositing layers again, so would lose all its scrolling nodes.
        
        Fix by having ScrollingStateTree::detachNode() by default set aside subframe nodes
        into a hash map. On reattach, we'll look in the hash map and pull out an existing node
        (with its children intact) if possible.

        Move generate prototype and constructor classes into the generated implementation files
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134054

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        In an effort to reduce the size of the generated bindings headers, which is important
        as the generated headers get included in a lot of places, this patch moves the prototype
        and constructor declarations from the header to implementation file. This works because,
        for the most part, no code cares about the prototype or constructors except the instance.

        There are a few exceptions which had to be accounted for:
        - The global objects (JSDOMWindow and JSWorkerGlobalScope) need to have their prototypes
          available during initialization, so they remain in the header.
        - JSLocation requires customizing some aspects of the prototype behavior, so its prototype,
          and any future class that uses JSCustomNamedGetterOnPrototype or JSCustomDefineOwnPropertyOnPrototype,
          remains in the header.
        - A few classes had custom constructor functions. Instead of keeping the entire constructor
          in the header, I opted for pulling just the static constructor function into the header, and
          modifying the custom constructors to use the DOMConstructorObject type as the callee, since the
          more specific type was unnecessary.

        As a result of making these changes, I was also able to remove the #include of JSDOMBinding.h from
        all the headers, which brought in quite a bit.

        Subtrees with :first-child and :last-child are not invalidated when siblings are added/removed
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133934

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        When adding/removing nodes on an element, we try to invalidate only the elements that are
        affected. In the case of :first-child and :last-child, that optimizations is implemented
        through two types of flags that are updated during style resolution.

        The first flag is childrenAffectedByFirstChildRules (childrenAffectedByLastChildRules),
        set on the parent of any element that could be affected by :first-child (:last-child).

        The other part of the optimization is marking the style itself with firstChildState (lastChildState)
        to further reduce invalidations.

        The problem in this case happen with a subtree of element is detached. Since there is no renderer,
        the computed style is resolved ad-hoc and stored directly on the element. When the element is moved,
        the computed style was never cleared because the invalidation optimizations were not handling
        elements without style.

        REGRESSION (r167856): Unable to log into HSBC app
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133991
        <rdar://problem/17044839>

        Reviewed by David Kilzer.

        Following <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/167856> we disallow "navigation to any URL that is
        invalid, except for JavaScript URLs, which need not be valid." A byproduct of this policy
        decision is that we no longer notify the WebKit client to about a navigation if the destination
        URL is invalid. And some apps, including the HSBC app for iOS, have logic to intercept URLs
        as a means to pass data from their WebView-embedded web app to the WebView. We should expose a
        setting called allowNavigationToInvalidURL (disabled by default on all ports and conditionally
        enabled on iOS) to toggle whether WebCore allows navigation to any URL, even if its invalid,
        so as to not break clients that intercept URLs and have custom logic to handle them.

        ScriptExecutionContext::Task parameters should be rvalue references as the

        This isn't really necessary since ScriptExecutionContext::Task is non-copyable

        [UI-side compositing] fix reflections on composited layers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133942

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Fix reflections on composited layers. There are two main set of changes.
        
        First, a PlatformCALayerRemote which is a clone has to track the layer
        it is a clone of, so it knows where to grab the contents from in the UI process.
        This layer may be told that its contents need updating out of order during
        recursiveBuildTransaction(), so we need some small changes in RemoteLayerTreeContext
        to allow a layer to add itself to the set of layers requiring commit.
        
        In the UI process, a new step is added to RemoteLayerTreeHost::updateLayerTree()
        to go through clones, and copy their contents from the origin layer.
        
        The second set of changes makes platformCALayerLayerDidDisplay() work for
        UI-side compositing by not taking a PlatformLayer*, but instead a PlatformCALayer*.
        PlatformCALayer::setContentsChanged() changed to copyContentsFromLayer() so we know
        what the origin layer is.

        Avoid synchronous layout in window.scrollTo(0,0) when already at (0,0)
        <https://webkit.org/b/133893>

        Going from 0,0 to 0,0 is a no-op since there is no way a layout will
        affect the current scroll position.

        We don't send scroll events when moving to the previous position,
        so this change is not observable.

        Sometimes asking accessibilityIsIgnored() will cause a newObject to be detached immediately after its created. 
        The creation function holds a reference with RefPtr as long as it lives, but when that method returns, the object goes away.

        [Bindings] "nullable" sequence support is incomplete (i.e. sequence<NativeType>?)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131240

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Nullable sequences are not fully supported in WebKit's
        code generator machinery. Although the generated code
        does add "is nullable" check to the evaluation condition
        (i.e. if (arg.isNull() || ...)), when the JSValue
        that holds a "null" JSObject is actually to be "converted"
        to a native Vector<T>, it fails.

        The reason for the failure is in JSDOMBindings::toNativeArray.
        This method verifies that JSValue does not hold a "non-null"
        object, and it bails out.
        Analogly, the "ref ptr" variant of this method (toRefPtrNativeArray)
        does support nullables.

        [MSE][Mac] Occasional image corruption after seeking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133879

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Change the order of operations for seeks: change the current time of the AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer
        before flushing and appending non-displaying samples.

        Rather than having a single function which retrieves the fast seek time and then seeks, split this out
        into two functions: one which gets the fast seek time, and one which seeks. (The later of course already
        exists: seekToTime()).

        We rewrite RenderMathMLRoot in order to fix bugs with SVG transforms and dynamic modification of children and allow drawing with an OpenType MATH table.
        The drawing of the radical sign (without the top bar) is now moved to a RenderMathMLRadicalOperator class inheriting from RenderMathMLOperator.
        This class fallbacks to the original drawing with graphic primitives if an OpenType MATH table is not available.

        Store DOM constants directly in the JS object rather than jumping through a custom accessor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133898

        Reviewed by Oliver Hunt.

        Instead of implementing constants as custom accessors that just happen to return a value,
        we now store the constant directly in the HashTableValue array (where the GetValueFunc used
        to be). 
        
        - For the case where the constant is accessed via the static table (still in use for instances 
          and some prototypes), the static lookup function will set the value on the property slot,
          instead of passing a function pointer.
        - For the case where the constant is eagerly reified (most prototypes and all constructors) the
          constant is put directly in the object.

        Masks disappear when layers become tiled
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133892
        <rdar://problem/17309793>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.
        
        There were several problems with tiled mask layers.
        
        First, when a layer became tiled it failed to re-apply the platform layer
        for its mask; fixed by adding MaskLayerChanged to the set of flags in
        swapFromOrToTiledLayer().
        
        Secondly, in CA, a mask layer's superlayer is the layer which is it masking,
        so the if (oldLayer->superlayer())... code in swapFromOrToTiledLayer() would
        erroneously try to swap out a sublayer on the superlayer with the mask.
        
        Thirdly, the mask layer is updated after its host layer, but when the mask layer
        become tiled, there was no code that updated the mask platform layer on its
        host layer. Fix by:
            1. setting a bit on a layer to note that it's being used as a mask.
            2. setting the parent of such a layer to its host layer (mimicking CA)
            3. when the mask becomes tiled, dirtying the MaskLayerChanged bit on
               its parent and adding a clause to commitLayerChangesAfterSublayers()
               to update the mask layer.
        
        Finally, ASSERTION FAILED: owningGraphicsLayer()->isCommittingChanges() would
        fire because we failed to set the m_isCommittingChanges flag while committing
        the mask layer. Fix by moving the TemporaryChange<bool> that sets this flag
        into commitLayerChangesBeforeSublayers() and commitLayerChangesAfterSublayers().
        
        Also used safe casts in more places in GraphicsLayerCA.

        Draw radicals with glyphs for better rendering

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        We rewrite RenderMathMLRoot in order to fix bugs with SVG transforms and dynamic modification of children and allow drawing with an OpenType MATH table.
        The drawing of the radical sign (without the top bar) is now moved to a RenderMathMLRadicalOperator class inheriting from RenderMathMLOperator.
        This class fallbacks to the original drawing with graphic primitives if an OpenType MATH table is not available.

        We rewrite RenderMathMLRoot in order to fix bugs with SVG transforms and dynamic modification of children and allow drawing with an OpenType MATH table.
        The drawing of the radical sign (without the top bar) is now moved to a RenderMathMLRadicalOperator class inheriting from RenderMathMLOperator.
        This class fallbacks to the original drawing with graphic primitives if an OpenType MATH table is not available.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Introduce an explicit type for resolved grid positions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131732

        Reviewed by Sergio Villar Senin.

        We were using simple size_t integers to represent resolved grid
        positions in our internal data structures. This change allows us to
        clarify the code, avoid potential off by one mistakes, and move the
        resolving code to a central place.

        A new class GridResolvedPosition has been created and the related
        methods have been moved there from RenderGrid.
        GridSpan is now defined by two GridResolvedPosition, so all the code
        using it has been modified to adapt it to GridResolvedPosition.

        No new tests as it is already covered by current tests
        (fast/css-grid-layout/).

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        We claim to be Safari (among others) to ensure maximum
        compatibility with existing web sites. Valid Safari UA strings do
        always (since Safari 3.0) contain the string "Version/X" before
        the "Safari/X" part. We were wrongly only adding it in very
        specific cases and we were placing it at the wrong position as it
        must precede the "Safari/X" part.

        From now on we unconditionally prepend the "Version/X" string to
        the "Safari/X" part as we always claim to be Safari. This makes
        the NeedsSafariVersion6 quirk invalid. This not only fixes
        "unsupported browser" issues in icloud.com, but also in
        globalforestwatch.com and live.com among many others.

        Apart from that I'm bumping the Safari Version in the UA to 8.0 as
        we're already claiming to be "Safari/538.35"" which corresponds to
        Safari 8 beta.

        When a request is taken from the cache, its cached response headers are empty, if the cache entry was created in the same session.

        There is also an issue if two jobs are loading the same url at the same time.

        This is a revert of r155324.

        By forcing line-height to be normal, r155324 was forcing WebKit to inspect font metrics
        to determine the height of a line. This means that if a fallback font was required to
        draw a line of text, and the fallback font had a higher ascent than the primary font,
        the entire line of text would be pushed down. If we don't force line-height to be normal,
        then we use the line-height value instead, which short circuits this mechanism, thereby
        not pushing text down.

        Work towards having frames in the scrolling tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133665

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.
        
        Optionally (based on Setting) create nodes in the scrolling tree for frames which
        contain async-scrollable content. This will be used on iOS/WK2 to support accelerated
        overflow-scroll in iframes. The setting allows for testing on OS X.
        
        The change breaks an assumption in ScrollingCoordinator/AsyncScrollingCoordinator
        that we're always dealing with the main frame, and changes logic in RenderLayerCompositor
        so that we can connect the scrolling tree across frame boundaries. RenderLayerCompositor
        maintains a m_subframeScrollLayersNeedReattach flag that gets set whenever we add or remove
        scroll-coordinated layers in the current frame. When set, after updating compositing
        layers we walk child frames, and, if they have scrolling nodes, re-attach them to the
        scrolling tree (which will find the new ancestor node).

        Improve CSSPrimitiveValue::customCSSText for ARMv7
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133597

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        On imgur, some script is updating some layout on timers and on scroll.

        It looks like CSSPrimitiveValue::customCSSText() is a little constrained
        by the instruction cache on ARMv7. This patch improve the situation a bit.

        First, the creation of the string itself is changed to go from two allocation to one.
        Previously, we would allocate a StringBuffer and adopt it. Now we allocate a StringImpl
        directly with the inline buffer.

        The second issue is that the compiler was generating a real copy constructor for every
        assignment of the "text" variable (likely because the variable span is so large).
        This was solved by moving the string creating into a separate function (to fix the span)
        and being careful with passing PassRef<StringImpl> around.

        Then there was the problem that the compiler was a little too aggressive with inlining
        which caused each "case" to repeat the same prologue and epilogue before formatValue().
        This was solved by adding formatNumberValue() with NEVER_INLINE to have the prologue/epilogue
        in a single place.

        On older device, that's about 3% improvement on style access. On modern ARM64/x86_64
        there is no noticeable difference.

        Document::updateStyleIfNeededForNode can get very expensive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133599

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        When pages are querying their style, we first run through
        Document::updateStyleIfNeededForNode() to find if that particular node needs style recalc.

        The problem was that updateStyleIfNeededForNode() could get really expensive. For each node,
        it needs to check the whole parent chain to find if any needs style recalc.
        When web pages get a bunch of nodes and querying their style, we ended up going over a lot
        of nodes just to find there is nothing to do.

        This patch adds two tweaks to reduce the problem:
        First, before querying nodeOrItsAncestorNeedsStyleRecalc() we check if the Document is dirty at all.
        The other part is making nodeOrItsAncestorNeedsStyleRecalc() faster by removing useless elements check.

        REGRESSION: missing underline under CJK text
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128145

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch refactors the GlyphToPathTranslator which is used to find intersections of
        glyphs and underlines. It was modified to allow for querying these pieces of
        information:
        1) The extents of the glyph. This can be used to make the underlines skip an entire
        glyph, wholesale
        2) What kind of skipping behavior should be used
        3) The Path which represents the glyph
        There are three skipping behaviors:
        1) (SkipDescenders) The previous behavior
        2) (SkipGlyph) Make the underline skip over the entire glyph, using the extents() function
        3) (DrawOverGlyph) Make the underline plow through the glyph, ignoring any descenders

        Calculating which underlining behavior to use depends on what the base codepoint that
        originated that glyph is. This means that we have to map from glyphs to characters,
        something which is nontrivial to do. In order to solve this problem, this patch adds
        an optional vector to GlyphBuffer which represents the location in the original string
        from which a particular glyph originated. Then, when our WidthIterator code adds
        glyphs to the GlyphBuffer, we can include the extra information about where we are
        in the input string. Once this data is available, the GlyphPathTranslator can look up
        the base codepoint from which this glyph originates, and can run ICU functions on that
        codepoint.

        We can use the ICU ublock_getCode() function to find which Unicode block a particular
        codepoint comes from. If the codepoint comes from a CJK block, we will use
        DrawOverGlyph; otherwise, we will use SkipDescenders.

        [Mac] checkboxes and radio buttons animate incorrectly

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        As many people have noticed, the new checkboxes and radio
        buttons jump around during their animation. To fix this
        I've added yet another magic set of numbers to our
        native form positioning - this time the placement
        of the controls when rendering on the animated path.
        This is quite annoying, since there doesn't appear
        to be any pattern to the offsets (or margins) given
        a control size, and this case also needed a sub-pixel
        offset to display correctly on retina machines.

        Reviewed by Anders Carlson.

        Revision 168397 introduced a new animated style of form controls. Part of
        it included extending the margins for the controls to take into account the
        focus ring that animates in from a large radius to a small radius. This
        caused two problems:

        - the incorrect margins broke many layouts
        - despite increased margins, there were still some areas
          that did not repaint correctly.

        Restore the old margins and (temporarily) turn off focus ring animation.
        Bad layout is much worse than a missing animation. Another benefit
        of this is that we will use less memory.

        Use C++11 lambdas to construct FileThread::Task objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133079

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Have FileThread::Task constructor take in a std::function<void ()>-like object
        as the second parameter. Much like with ScriptExecutionContext::Task, the idea here
        is to use inlined C++11 lambdas in FileThread::postTask() calls. Because FileThread::Task
        also requires an instance pointer, a brace-init list is passed to these calls, passing
        in the instance pointer as the first parameter and the C++11 lambda as the second.

        FileThread::postTask() now takes in a FileThread::Task rvalue and moves it onto the heap
        and into the queue.

        In AsyncFileStream.cpp, calls to FileThread::postTask() are updated to use C++11 lambdas.
        Uses of MainThreadTask are also replaced by C++11 lambdas. This modernizes the code and
        removes a lot of helper functions.

        FileThread::Task doesn't use CrossThreadCopier anymore. Instead, we manually produce
        thread-safe copies as necessary. At the moment this approach produces another copy when
        passing the freshly-copied object into the lambda, but this will be avoidable once we
        make C++14 and the lambda capture expression support mandatory.

        Make indexed getters more efficient by using PropertySlot::setValue()

        The function pointer approach would make sense if we did inline caching

        Hit testing for the new columns doesn't care about compositing but does still
        need a pagination layer set to work. The old column code didn't care about this
        because it was top down (and wrong). The new code lets each layer paint and hit
        test its own fragments, so having a pagination layer set suddenly becomes relevant
        for composited layers.
    
        The solution is to cache whether or not the pagination layer crosses a compositing
        boundary, and then to force call sites of enclosingPaginationLayer to pass an argument
        indicating whether compositing layers should be included. Typically painting wants to
        exclude them but hit testing wants to include them.

        Filter effects are not subpixel aware yet. They paint to integrally sized image buffers.
        In order to ensure that the content is rendered to the the same position on the filter 
        source context as if there was no filter, the repaint rects need to be adjusted to match with
        the internal filter snapping (enclosingIntRect).
        This is a temporary change until after filter effects get subpixelized.

        However, this changeset regresses RenderNameFlow clipping when the content is on subpixel position
        and filter effect is present. Instead of adding the failing test cases to TestExpectations, I removed

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133500

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Unlike the other tree marking optimization, adding HasPseudoStyle() on an element style
        during style resolution must be conservative and not set the flag unless every other filter
        matched first.

        After r169547, the SelectorChecker was setting flags on HasPseudoStyle() during the pseudo
        element matching. If that passed but the remaining filter did not match, the element style
        could have the flag "FIRST_LETTER" while not being able to resolve a style for "FIRST_LETTER".

        When the layout code was creating the renderer, it would find the FIRST_LETTER flag on the main style
        and try to get the specific style for FIRST_LETTER. Since no rule would resolve for FIRST_LETTER,
        the style would be null and the code would be crashing when accessing its parameters.

        This patch fixes the issue by moving the style marking for pseudo element at the end of the matching.

        Lists styled with SVG fonts are not rendered as expected
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133198

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        There were a couple places in RenderListMarker and RenderMenuList that were
        implicitly creating TextRuns by passing a String to a function which
        expected a TextRun. Because TextRun has a constructor which takes a single
        String and isn't marked explicit, TextRuns were being created without
        any of the associated code that initializes the TextRun (such as creating
        a RenderingContext if necessary).

        There is currently one more client of this code that needs to be fixed.
        This is in RenderThemeIOS::adjustMenuListButtonStyle(). However, fixing
        this will be a somewhat large change, and is out of scope for this patch.
        I will submit a follow-up patch that fixes this permanently. Once this is
        fixed, I can mark TextRun's constructors as explicit.

        Fix some corner cases of :hover and :active in quirks mode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133493

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Previously, the quirks mode of :hover and :active were evaluated from the SelectorFragment
        in fragmentOnlyMatchesLinksInQuirksMode(). There were two problems with that approach:
        1) The FragmentGenerator optimizes out some filter when they always match or can never match.
           Those fragment should still qualify :hover and :active, but they were lost
           for fragmentOnlyMatchesLinksInQuirksMode().
        2) Explicitely listing every attribute of SelectorFragment in fragmentOnlyMatchesLinksInQuirksMode()
           was extremly fragile. When :not() and :-webkit-any() were added, we forgot to update the quirks
           exceptions.

        This patch moves the quirks mode exception code from the code generator to the Fragment generator.
        The useless filters are no longer ignored for the quirks, and we don't need to update the quirks mode detection
        with every change of SelectorFragment.

        It is inefficient and ugly, but that is how that quirks is defined. It is only a problem for compilation,
        execution time remains unchanged.

        Make pseudo element matching for style resolution more JIT friendly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133441

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Sharing pseudo elements is a complicated mess shared between the SelectorChecker
        and the RuleCollector.

        For compiling pseudo element matching, it would be best if all the complexity could
        be moved to compile time instead of runtime. It is also preferable to keep the compiler
        independant of the RuleCollector implementation's detail.

        This patch is a first step toward that goal. The main objective here is to make
        "dynamicPseudo" completely internal to the SelectorChecker.
        This is mostly a mechanical change, it is likely PseudoElement matching could be simplified
        further but that is not attempted here.

        Test: fast/css/style-sharing-empty-rule-modification.html

        * css/ElementRuleCollector.cpp:
        (WebCore::ElementRuleCollector::ruleMatches):
        The condition regarding pseudo element matching has been moved into SelectorChecker::match().

        This creates an extra cost for querySelector(), but that should be fine since the vast majority
        of selectors are JIT compiled and never use SelectorChecker in the first place.

        (WebCore::ElementRuleCollector::collectMatchingRulesForList):
        The loop is changed such that the tree marking (Style::setHasPseudoStyle) could be moved
        to SelectorChecker.

        The conditions about the security origin for getMatchedCSSRules() and the empty style rules
        are moved prior to the call to ElementRuleCollector::ruleMatches(). This ensure we keep the same
        behavior of not adding the pseudo style for empty rules (this could also help with tree marking
        in general but empty rules are probably uncommon).

        There is one behavior change from making this loop simpler: the SharingRules and StyleInvalidation
        modes now update their ruleRange. It is useless but it is simpler.

        [MSE] Appends of overlapping sample data do not clear existing samples properly.

        Test: media/media-source/media-source-overlapping-append.html

        The MSE spec has a spec error in how it removes overlapping frames. The intention seems to be
        to check for overlapping samples only when the incoming sample increases the highest presentation time
        field. But due to a mismatch in the range of a sample, defined as [start, end), and the check, which 
        treats the end as inclusive, the overlapping check is almost never run.

        Add the sample comparison logic to match [start, end) ranges, and rename the existing check to differentiate
        it from the new one:

        getBBox() returns (0,0) when width or height is zero.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93290

        Reviewed by Philip Rogers.

        The SVG spec states that a width or height of zero for  rects, circles and
        ellipses is valid but disables rendering of that shape.
        In this case, getBBox() should return the actual bounding box of the element.
        Previously, WebKit always returned (0,0,0,0) rather than the
        correct bounding box. This patch fixes that. 

        Rects and ellipses both now follow the same behaviour where
        the fall-back code path is only used when the shape will render (e.g. not
        when a dimension <= 0).
  
        This necessitates calling calculateRadiiAndCenter for ellipses even
        when the calculated values will be discarded in the fall back code path.
        But calculateRadiiAndCenter is cheap and this avoids making changes 
        elsewhere to stop CG drawing a zero width (or height) ellipse.

        With the gradual migration of scroll offsets to floating point, we ended
        up with a fully floating point code path been event scroll deltas and
        setting scroll positions in the scrolling tree.
        
        With some input devices (e.g. Logitech scrollwheel mice), the scroll deltas
        come in with non-integral values, and that caused the scroll offset to be non-integral,
        resulting in fuzzy layer contents. So round the scroll position.

        CSS JIT: add support for the pseudo classes :hover and :active
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133295

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch adds compilation support for :hover and :active. The code generation of both of them is trivial,
        most of the patch is improving the infrastructure and safety.

        The document compatibility mode is moved to its own typed enum. This ensure the values are exclusives and
        the native type is known (unsigned char here). The values are changes to binary flags to take advantage of
        test-and-branch on ARM64 (not used explicitely, it is automatically generated by the MacroAssembler).

        The other important refactoring is the code updating the flags on RenderStyle::NonInheritedFlags.
        The code was duplicated in some places so it is move into its own function addFlagToElementStyleFromContext().

        The generators themself are very simple. First we check the quirks-mode exceptions, that is generally excluded
        at compile time because the conditions are almost never met, even in strict mode.
        Then we have two cases: style resolution and query selector. Almost everything is just function calls.

        Correct two problems:
        1. Add new logic to handle cues that are identical to existing cues, except
           that they cover a slightly later moment in playback. For example, a cue
           encoding device might emit a cue at 24 fps, with many of the cues containing
           the same content but covering only 1/24th of a second.
           
           Rather than hiding and displaying our cues at the cue encoding rate, we should
           simply continue to display the same cue as long as the content is unchanged.
        2. The cue "isEqual" logic for TextTrackCueGeneric improperly short-circuited the
           VTTCue isEqual logic. This was done to avoid a false failure due to the cue
           type being 'generic' rather than 'vtt', but incorrectly treated cues with
           non-matching text as equal.

        <rdar://problem/16462535>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When the scroll position changes in an accelerated overflow-scroll element, we have
        to update child nodes in the scrolling tree for position:sticky. That requires a
        more generic ability to update the scrolling tree after some arbitrary zoom or
        scroll. To do this, we need to know the current fixed position rect, rather than
        having it passed in.
        
        So make the fixed position rect available from ScrollingTree, and make it possible
        to get the current scrollPosition() from any ScrollingTreeScrollingNode.
        
        Also, implement updateLayersAfterDelegatedScroll() in ScrollingTreeOverflowScrollingNodeIOS,
        and have it update descendant layers.
        
        Finally, fix ScrollingTreeOverflowScrollingNode to use the correct rectangle for its
        constraints math, using the scroll position of the parent node if appropriate.

        vw/vh units used as font/line-height values don't scale with the viewport
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87846

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch moves the resolution of viewport units to style recalc
        time. Currently viewport units are left unresolved during style
        recalcs, which leads to many problems with viewport units. Moving the
        resolution will fix these problems, as well as reduce the plumbing
        that goes on.

        This patch touches a lot of files since the valueForLength functions
        no longer need a RenderView. The interesting changes are in:

        - CSSToLengthConversionData -> CSSPrimitiveValue: for moving
            resolution to style recalc time.
        - Length / LengthFunctions: no longer needs to know about viewport
            units.
        - FrameView -> Document -> StyleResolver: for scheduling style recalcs
            upon resize

        Note that getComputedStyle will now return pixel values when viewport
        units are used. This behavior matches Firefox and the css3-cascade
        spec.

        Lists styled with SVG fonts are not rendered as expected
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133198

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        There were a couple places in RenderListMarker and RenderMenuList that were
        implicitly creating TextRuns by passing a String to a function which
        expected a TextRun. Because TextRun has a constructor which takes a single
        String and isn't marked explicit, TextRuns were being created without
        any of the associated code that initializes the TextRun (such as creating
        a RenderingContext if necessary).

        This patch marks the aforementioned constructor as "explicit" to discourage
        such behavior in the future.

        When removing the child of an object, the removeChild method should return the next element
        following the one being deleted. This will ensure that proper iteration and destruction of
        an object's children is possible.

        No new tests added. This is because the test that triggers this issue also triggers
        another assertion, in RenderMultiColumnSet::requiresBalancing(). However, that is a totally

        Fix the quirks mode selector matching of the pseudo classes :hover and :active
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133063

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Our implementation of the quirks mode of :active and :hover was very wrong. The only
        thing it was doing is verify the pseudo class is not the first selector of a fragment
        (which was conveniently the only thing that was tested :)).

        Since those pseudo class were only checking for the order of the filters, something like
            #target:hover
        would succeed because :hover is not the first simple selector, while
            :hover#target
        would fail.

        That behavior is also a problem for the CSS JIT as it is an implementation detail of SelectorChecker
        and compiling something like that with our out-of-order matching would be nonsense.

        This patch update the implementation to follow http://quirks.spec.whatwg.org/#the-:active-and-:hover-quirk
        Basically, the only cases that do not work in quirks mode are selectors composed only of "*, :hover and :active".

        To implement this behavior, I needed to be able to inspect a complete selector fragment, including
        what is before and after :hover/:active.
        To do that, I replaced the boolean isSubSelector by a pointer to the first selector of the fragment.
        When we need to match :active/:hover in quirks mode, we just go over all the selectors in the fragment
        to find one of the qualifying match type.

        From Blink r150472 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>

        According to specs each child of a grid container must become a
        grid item meaning that grid items are grid level boxes and thus,
        do not participate in the block formatting context but in the grid
        formatting one.

        This change updates the grid items' 'display' property after style
        resolution so that we match the specification (see section 4. Grid
        Items). The spec basically instructs us to compute the value of
        'display' by applying the table in CSS2.1 Chapter 9.7

        [iOS][WK2] Use ScrollView's scrollOffset as the unobscuredContentRect
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133262

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Since VisibleContentRect was fixed, we were no longer sending scroll events when updating the scrollOffset
        when updating the visible content rects. The reason is that the scrollOffset was defined as the top left of the
        VisibleContentRect, and as such was already at the end position after updating the unobscured rect.

        This patch split the unobscuredContentRect in unobscuredContentSize (updated live on zoom) and the position defined
        by the ScrollView's scrollOffset (updated when scrolling).

        Snapping relative negative coordinate values should produce the same position as if they were
        positive absolute coordinates.
        When a child box gets positioned off of its containers towards top/left, its relative coordinates
        become negative. Pixel snapping those negative values should produce the same
        final painting position as if the child box was fixed positioned with positive coordinates.
        Since halfway values always round away from zero, negative and positive halfway values

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        This patch modifies the RenderMathMLOperator code to use the MATH table
        when one is provided in the current font on the <math> tag. More
        precisely, the MathVariants table is used to draw a size variant or
        a glyph assembly. The displaystyle attribute is not supported yet, so
        for now large operators are always assumed to be in display style. The
        MATH support does not work well with all platforms+fonts, so at the
        moment the default font-family on the <math> is not changed.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        When the maximum cache limit is exceeded, I get a crash.
        This happens when deleting cache entries, because a reference to the url string object in the LRU list
        is used as a parameter to invalidateCacheEntry(), when called from makeRoomForNewEntry().
        When the string is removed from the LRU list in makeRoomForNewEntry(), the string is deleted.
        Next, the string is accessed again to remove the url from the index, and we crash.

        This can be fixed by removing the string from the LRU list after it is removed from the index.

        Fixing the crash also revealed an infinite loop problem.
        If the url for some reason only exist in the LRU list, and not in the index,
        we will inifitely loop in makeRoomForNewEntry(), trying to remove this url from the cache, but never succeeding.
        This can be fixed by removing the url from the LRU list, also when it's not in the index.

        [iOS][WK2] Add support for minimal-ui viewports

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Add support for minimal-ui directly into the Viewport configuration.

        ViewportConfiguration knows about two kinds of layout size in scrollview coordinates:
        -normal size
        -minimal ui size.

        Initially, the page is initialized with resetMinimalUI() and starts with a normal layout.

        At any time before the main resource is loaded, the Web page can update its viewport meta tag
        to include minimal-ui. The viewport configuration is updated immediately to reflect the minimal-ui
        layout size. Any layout after that takes minimal-ui into account.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Fixed the bug by rolling out r156252.

        When the user taps on the status on facebook.com, the page focuses a textarea,
        which is then made momentarily invisible by setting display:none.
        The page then removes display:none later and expects the textarea to be still focused.

        With r156252, the focus is removed after the page sets display:none and the keyboard disappears.
        Since the focus is never reset on the textarea, the user can never type in anything.

        The specification may need to change here given that this (rather odd) behavior/expectation exists
        on one of the most popular websites on the Web.

        The original code was only calling platformMakeCurrent when the

        would only create a context, but it wouldn't make that context
        current. This patch ensures platformMakeCurrent is also called for
        the alternate code path, and, if it fails to make the context
        current, will destroy the context. Effectively, this makes both
        code paths behave in the same way.

        Element within flattened frame may update its scroll state during the layout phase of the wrong RenderView
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133013
        <rdar://problem/16760154>

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        Fixes an issue where the scroll state of an element may be updated during the layout of the wrong
        RenderView. In particular, the scroll state of an element inside a CSS flex box in a flattened
        frame f is updated during the layout of the RenderView associated with the parent frame of f instead
        of during the layout of the RenderView associated with f.

        The layout machinery assumes that the scroll state of each scrollable element is updated before the
        completion of layout for its associated RenderView. Currently we have logic to defer updating the scroll
        state of a scrollable element until completion of recursive layout. For a page with a flattened frame, we
        defer such updates until completion of layout for all RenderViews along the ancestor frame hierarchy of
        each flattened frame regardless of the RenderView associated with the element that originated the
        deferred scroll state request. Instead, only the RenderView associated with the element that deferred its
        scroll state update should dispatch the scroll state update.

        [CSS Regions] Crash while painting block selection gaps in regions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132720

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The fix for WebKit bug https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131511
        allowed selection highlight to match the DOM selection when the start
        and end point of the selection were in different flow threads. In order
        to enable that, the selection was performed separately on view and
        render flow threads, considered selection subtrees.

        However, the start and end points for each selection subtree were computed
        by means of Range class but it is not always possible to construct a valid
        Range from two pairs of RenderObjects and offsets.

        This patch keeps the substrees approach but instead of storing the endpoints
        for each subtree in a Range and continuously extending the Range, it stores them
        using the already available SelectionSubtreeRoot class. After the end points are
        computed for each subtree and before processing the subtree selection, the end points
        are adjusted in a similar fashion as the one used in FrameSelection::updateAppearance(),
        to make sure we are passing the same expected information to the method implementing
        the visible selection processing.

        Text decorations do not contribute to visual overflow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132773

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch creates a function, visualOverflowForDecorations, which computes
        how much visual overflow to add around a text box due to text decorations. Most of the time,
        text decorations are fully contained within the text box, so the result is usually 0.

        This function exists within style/InlineTextBoxStyle.cpp, which is an added file. This is
        so that it can be called from setLogicalWidthForTextRun() inside RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp
        and from RenderStyle::changeAffectsVisualOverflow(). The former case passes in the full
        InlineTextBox and the latter case just passes in a RenderStyle (because the InlineTextBox
        is unavailable.)

        This patch also modifies RenderTableSection::spannedColumns() to fix an off-by-one error
        that was causing table borders to not be drawn when they existed right on the edge of
        a repaint rect.

        When support for solid colors on layers was added, a layer was considered a candidate
        for the solid color optimization without regard to whether it had descendent layers
        with "paintsIntoCompositedAncestor" requirements.
        
        Fix hasVisibleNonCompositingDescendantLayers(), renaming it to isPaintDestinationForDescendentLayers()
        and having it take into account whether descendent layers need to paint into an
        ancestor.
        
        Also, this test has to happen after those descendent layers have had their
        compositing state updated, so move the isSimpleContainerCompositingLayer() to
        a new updateAfterDescendents() function which is called from the various
        places we do compositing-udpate-tree-walks.

        This patch removes unnecessary integral snapping of inlines at layout time.

        The general rule of thumb of using round/floor/ceil at layout time is to not use them.
 
        When some computed values (x, y, width, height) get snapped during layout, while others don't,
        intersecting/measuring mismatches could occur and they could end up producing visual artifacts such as truncations.
        This patch also enables iframe content to be positioned on odd device pixel positions on retina displays.

        AX: iOS: using AXAttributeCacheEnabler is too slow for every accessibilityElementAtIndex:
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133043

        Reviewed by Mario Sanchez Prada.

        iOS Accessibility code tries to improve performance by caching attributes when accessing
        elements through the platform API. However, those API calls can be used very frequently when 
        iterating elements. Creating the AXAttributeCacheEnabler object and tearing it down is proving
        to be the hottest code path in samples for accessibility access.

        We need to move the logic for enabling/disabling the attribute cache to a level that can make
        a more informed decision about when to enable/disable.

        REGRESSION (r166422): All RenderBox objects grew 104 bytes from adding repaint timers.
        <https://webkit.org/b/133027>
        <rdar://problem/16867410>

        Instead of storing a rarely-used repaint timer on every RenderBox, store one
        on the RenderView, and keep a hash set of renderers needing repaint.

        Renderers get a flag tracking whether they have a pending lazy repaint.
        This way we can avoid hash lookups in the common case.

        Also added a static assertion to catch RenderBox growing in the future.

        Eliminate unnecessary churn in MediaSourcePrivateAVFObjC by having the predicate
        functor take bare pointers, rather than a PassRefPtr.

        The underlying problem seems to be in WebAVStreamDataParserListener. RefPtrs were
        being created off the main thread to a non-thread safe ref counted class. In some
        situations, this would result in double decrementing the ref, which would cause an

        pointers with explicit weak ones. Ensure the parser and its delegate are not freed
        before the append operation completes by passing strong pointers into the async
        append operation lambda.

        Fixes an assertion failure when removing an SVG element with a duplicate id.

        When removing an SVG element with id A we synchronously instruct each element that references A
        to find the first element with id A, call this N, from the document root and register itself to
        either receive subsequent notifications from N (say, there is another element with id A) or as
        waiting for an element with id A (say, N = nullptr; => we removed the last element with id A from
        the document). Because the elements that reference A perform this operation synchronously when
        removing an element they consult an transient state of the DocumentOrderedMap when querying for the
        element with id A.
    
        Without loss of generality, let E, E_1, E_2, and E_3 be elements, where E_1, E_2, E_3 are children
        of E in that order and E_1.id = E_2.id = A and E_3.href = #A (that is, it references an element
        with id A). Suppose we remove E then we remove E_1, update DocumentOrderedMap to decrement its count
        for id A, and notify E_3 to look for an element with id A. This leads to an assertion failure since
        DocumentOrderedMap expects to find an element with id A, E_2, but cannot find such an element when
        traversing from the document root because E was unlinked from the document root (i.e. E_2 is in a
        disjoint subtree).

        SVG element may reference arbitrary DOM element before running its insertion logic
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132757
        <rdar://problem/15703817>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Fixes an issue where an SVG element may reference an arbitrary DOM element e before e finished being
        inserted in the tree.

        Currently when an SVG element A is inserted into a document we use document.getElementById() to find the
        element B it references (if any). If A is inserted before B and B has the same id as a later element in
        the document then A can find B before B is notified that its been inserted into the document (i.e. before
        Element::insertedFrom() is called on B). Instead, A should call document.getElementById() only after
        cessation of the insertion operation that inserted it to ensure that all inserted nodes (including B)
        processed their insertion-specific logic.

        In JSDOMWindow::getOwnPropertySlot, we currently look for the property on the JSDOMWindow, 
        then we search the window's subframes for name getters, then we look in the window's prototype 
        chain. Apparently we were doing the lookup in this order to be compatible with Mozilla, but 
        Mozilla no longer implements this behavior. Instead, they do the lookup on the prototype before 
        looking for subframe name getters. We should change this to match Mozilla. This has the convenient 
        side effect of allowing us to cache lookups in the window's prototype chain.

        Tiled scrolling indicator needs to take topContentInset into account

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The tiled scrolling indicator needs to move down by the value of the 
        topContentInset. This patch makes that happen by caching the topContentInset in 
        the TileController. This does feel a little silly since there is already a 
        function called setTiledScrollingIndicatorPosition() on TiledBacking. However, it 
        was often the case that calling that function had no effect because m_coverageMap 
        had not yet been created, and then the information was lost. So instead, we cache 
        the value.

            TileController relied on the tiling mode in TileCache to determine if it should use low-res
            tiles when zooming. Unfortunately, sometimes the tiling mode gets set to Zooming even though
            it's actually a pan. Thus we can end up with blurry tiles. Fix this by adding a new flag on
            TileCache that controls this behavior and have UIKit set it only when we have an actual zoom
            operation.

        On iOS, wikipedia pages can hang under RenderMultiColumnSet::repaintFlowThreadContent().
        It appears that computedColumnHeight is set to 0 in prepareForLayout, but layout never happens
        on the RenderMultiColumnSet in some cases, leaving the column height set to zero.
        This caused columnIndexAtOffset() to return bad values, which resulted in very long loops

        This patch makes the margin sizing functions return the set margin size scaled by 
        the TileGrid's scale. We also need to get rid of the old notion we used to have
        that margin tiles might be allowed to have a different size than the other tiles. 
        We don't want that. They should have the normal margin size, but they should
        affect the overall coverage area.

        Scale by the TileGrid's scale.

        Subpixel layout: Change Element.offset* client* scroll* return type to double.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132895

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch changes Element.offset*, Element.client* and Element.scroll* APIs return
        type from long to double to match the latest CSSOM View Module spec[1].
        Element.offset* and Element.client* do return subpixel values from now on.
        Element.scroll* still return integral values as the scrolling code hasn't adopted to subpixel rendering yet.

        subpixelCSSOMElementMetricsEnabled setting is added to be able to turn this feature on/off
        from WK2 preferences. It toggles the return value from subpixel to floored integral.
        It does not change layout/rendering behavior.

        [CSS Regions] Assertion failure in some cases with inline blocks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132859

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie.

        The patch hardens the conditions when the region range caches are
        populated to avoid desynchronizations when objects move during layout.
        This is true especially in the case of the boxes found inside
        inline blocks, that get their range from the containing line.

        There is a new function |computedRegionRangeForBox| that will always
        return a region range for a box using a best effort algorithm. This should
        be used only when there's no need to cache region information.

        This change also allows better control over the lifecycle of the
        |RenderBoxRegionInfo| objects stored on the regions. We can now iterate
        over the full range of the box when cleaning up the region box info. The
        same applies for the width change detection function.

        [iOS] Page scale update messages for media controls should only fire at the end of zooming

        As the user was zooming, the media controls that responded
        to the page scale (and resized themselves) would do so
        slightly out of sync with the screen refreshes, and it looked
        terrible. They really only need to get told at the end
        of the zoom that they need to relayout.

        Allow setPageScaleFactor to accept another parameter
        that indicates if the change is stable. That way, changes
        during a user triggers zoom gesture can be ignored for
        media controls.

        WebKit2 on iOS needs to capture the main thread's floating point environment.

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        For iOS, WorkerThread::workerThread() expects to be able to initialize the
        worker thread's floating point environment to be the same as the one in the
        main thread.  The FP env of the main thread is expected to have been captured
        in the mainThreadFEnv global.  On WebKit2 for iOS, we neglected to initialize
        mainThreadFEnv.

        We now introduce a FloatingPointEnvironment class that will encapsulate the main
        thread (aka "UIThread") fenv, and we'll call FloatingPointEnv::saveMainThreadEnvironment()
        from ChildProcess::platformInitialize() to ensure that the FloatingPointEnvironment
        singleton instance is initialized properly for WebKit2.

        In the ChildProcess::platformInitialize(), we also need to initialize the ARMv7

        saveMainThreadEnvironment().

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        On iOS fixed-position layers would get clipped to the document rect,
        but with rubber-banding, we can now have a custom fixed postion rect
        that extends outside the document rect.
        
        Another issue was that we would un-composite fixed elements sometimes
        when scrolling fast, again because they could fall outside of the document rect.
        
        A final issue was that pinching could reveal parts of fixed elements that should
        lie outside the viewport, rather than clipping the layers.
        
        Fix by converting both call points to use viewportConstrainedVisibleContentRect()
        rather than viewportConstrainedExtentRect(). On non-iOS platforms these are
        the same, but on iOS viewportConstrainedVisibleContentRect() uses the
        custom fixed position rect, which is the correct rect to intersect with.

        The new method "Editor::replaceNodeFromPasteboard" has the intent that the new DocumentFragment
        from the pasteboard is as similar to the old Node as possible.

        In practice, the new DocumentFragment:
        1 - Can represent a single node that's missing various attributes the original Node had.
        2 - Can be an unwanted fragment of arbitrary depth when the replacement happens inside Mail.app

        This fixes both of these issues.

        Patch by Erik Dahlström backported from Blink.

        "[SVG2] css 'outline' property should apply to svg elements 

        The 'outline' property was only partially working in SVG before
        this patch, this makes it work on text and text content child
        elements too. 

        This makes SVG render the outlines as part of the foreground paint
        phase.

        Instead, have one simple CrossThreadTask class that derives from ScriptExecutionContext::Task.
        Its templated constructor takes in the method and the variadic pack of parameters. The cross-thread
        copies of the parameters are then bound to that method and the resulting bind expression is used to
        initialize the base class. The bind expression is constructed with a placeholder for the

        CSS JIT: reduce cost of computing backtracking height
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132546

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Because compiler previously compute backtracking height for
        previous child fragment, by leveraging this, we can limit the
        `maxPrefixSize` for `computeBacktrackingHeightFromDescendant`.

        For example, consider selector "c>a>b>d>a>b e"'s descendant chain,
        "c>a>b>d>a>b".

        At the <a> position, we have matching pattern [b, a, d, b, a] and
        calculate the backtracking height by following method.

        pattern:    [b, a, d, b, a]
        candidate0:    [b, a, d, b]  => Not matched.
        candidate1:       [b, a, d]  => Not matched.
        candidate2:          [b, a]  => Matched against the pattern.

        At this time, first candidate0's pattern size is `pattern.size() - 1`.
        And get backtracking height from descendant 3, that is
        `pattern.size() - candidate.size()`, `5 - 2`.

        And next, at the <c> position, we calcucate the backtracking height
        for this pattern.

        pattern:    [b, a, d, b, a, c]
        candidate0:    [b, a, d, b, a]  => Not matched.
        candidate1:       [b, a, d, b]  => Not matched.
        candidate2:          [b, a, d]  => Not matched.
        candidate3:             [b, a]  => Not matched.
        candidate4:                [b]  => Not matched.
        candidate5:                 []  => Matched against the pattern.

        Then, we get the backtracking height, which is 6 (6 - 0).
        However, in the above case, we already know that attempts from candidate0
        to candidate1 always fail, since parts of these are already tested at
        the <b> position trial and we know they don't match.

        So in this case, we should start this computation from candidate2,
        such as,

        pattern:    [b, a, d, b, a, c]
        candidate2:          [b, a, d]  => Not matched.
        candidate3:             [b, a]  => Not matched.
        candidate4:                [b]  => Not matched.
        candidate5:                 []  => Matched against the pattern.

        We can start computation with candidate size
        `pattern.size() - previousChildFragmentBacktrackingHeight`.
        In this example, `pattern.size()` is 6 and
        `previousChildFragmentBacktrackingHeight` is 3, so candidate size is
        3, that is candidate2.

        Headers and footers need to take the inset into account, and they also need to 
        factor in the fact that the root layer moves around now too.

        The existing yPositionForRootContentLayer() is actually the right calculation for 
        the header layer. The root content layer wants that value, but pushed down by the 
        header height. Now there are static functions for both of them and the footer to

        When the 304 (Not-modified) response is received, the Curl backend should look up the cached response,
        and call the client method didReceiveResponse with the cached response, instead of the 304 response.
        Otherwise the response will contain an empty MIME type, which causes the request to be cancelled, and the client deleted.
        When the Curl cache manager then accesses the client afterwards, it is deleted, and we crash.

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch changes text selection rectangle calculation from integral to device
        pixel snapping. It ensures that selection rect painting matches box boundaries for inline elements.
        Directional rounding (horizontal only atm) is moved out from Font class and now accessible
        to all the painting code. RTL snapping strategy is changed from floor to round to match ltr behavior.
        However this patch does not address all the integral snapping across inline elements. There are
        a few places where we still calculate enclosing rects where snapping is sufficient.

        from HistoryController::restoreScrollPositionAndViewState(), the FrameView may not have a 
        scrolling node ID, which suggests that either the FrameView doesn't have a RenderView,
        or compositing hasn't happened yet.
        
        So if we enter AsyncScrollingCoordinator::frameViewRootLayerDidChange()
        and the FrameView has no scrollLayerID, just return. We'll fix things up
        when compositing kicks in later.

        [CSS Shapes] Can't select content within the area of the floating box when clip-path is applied
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131375

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        According to http://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1/, the clipped part of the element should
        not have pointer event dispatching. So add this logic to RenderBlock::nodeAtPoint. This
        fixes the bug as it disallows selection on any clipped parts.

        I implemented the proper selection for the various CSS box types and added testing
        for them. Also, I made and run performance tests for exposing mouse events over the
        clipped/non-clipped area, which results can be seen in bugzilla.

        [CSS Blending] Blending doesn't work if the parent stacking context is not a self painting layer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130891

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        The stacking context layers having unisolated blending descendants should be able
        to create transparency layers or to become composited in order to restrict blending 
        content to accessing the information outside the current stacking context.
        Some layers are not self painting layers and these layers cannot crate transparency
        layers and cannot be composited, thus they are not able to isolate blending descendants
        when it's required.
        
        The solution in this patch is to make a layer isSelfPaintingLayer when
        it needs to isolate blending descendants (hasUnisolatedBlendingDescendants).

        [iOS] Animate AVPlayerLayer into and out of full screen

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Rather than synchronize animations across the WebProcess / UIProcess boundary, animate
        the AVPlayerLayer into place by first resizing the full screen layer to occupy the
        entire screen in the WebProcess, and use a sublayerTransform animation in the UIProcess
        to scale the AVPlayer from its initial screen location, as well as back to its final screen
        location.

        ChildNodesLazySnapshot::m_childNodes needs two heap allocations.
        <https://webkit.org/b/132616>

        This seems a bit silly, since ChildNodesLazySnapshot is always
        allocated on the stack.

        Change it to be a bool + a Vector instead of using the nullity
        as a presence indicator. This way we also don't end up with an
        out-of-line ~OwnPtr for the Vector.

        Adapt inline SVG sizing behavior to Firefox and Blink
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132569

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This patch is ported from Blink CR 308992. Thanks to David Vest for helping
        with back porting his Blink patch. From the commit message:

        "The basis of this change is to map explicit width and height
        attributes to CSS properties, essentially promoting them to
        presentation attributes. Note that implicit "100%" width and height
        are not mapped.
        
        This enables us to remove the concept of "percentage intrinsic size"
        and rely on normal CSS rules to resolve percentage values.
        
        The change has been approved by the SVG WG and the spec is being
        updated. Minutes here:
        
        http://www.w3.org/2014/04/07-svg-minutes.html#item03"

        The new model was indeed approved by the SVG WG and is basically following
        the CSS 2.1 model for replaced elements.

        With this patch WebKit, Firefox and Blink have the same behavior for inline SVG.
        This is the first successful approach to unify the sizing behavior of SVG
        across UAs.

        Avoid triggering layer tree commits that touch the layer's boundsOrigin
        while the user is scrolling in the UI process.
        
        Fix the WKOverflowScrollViewDelegate to pass along an "inUserInteration"
        flag to the ScrollingTree to say that we're in the middle of a user interaction
        (and also to send a final non-interactive update). That gets passed along
        to the web process, and turned into "SyncScrollingLayerPosition" update.
        AsyncScrollingCoordinator::updateScrollPositionAfterAsyncScroll() consults
        this, and uses it to set a flag on the ScrollableArea to say that the scroll
        is a user scroll.
        
        RenderLayerBacking then makes use of this (in existing code, shared with WK1)
        to avoid triggering layer bounds setting. Instead, it now just calls syncBoundsOrigin(),
        which updates the GraphicsLayer without touching platform layers. This is necessary
        so that GraphicsLayer geometry is up-to-date (used for tiled layer visibility
        computations).
        
        Finally, a hack in GraphicsLayerCA::computeVisibleRect() is conditionalized
        for WebKit1 by checking the type of platform layer.

        Named element cache can become invalid during HTMLCollection::updateNamedElementCache()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132575

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Make sure the named element cache object stays valid in
        HTMLCollection::updateNamedElementCache() while it is populating it.

        The method was previously creating and setting the cache first, and then start
        traversing the DOM tree to populate it. As a consequence, hasNamedElementCache()
        would start returning true before the cache is actually populated.
        The issue is that finding matches in the DOM tree can cause
        HTMLCollection::invalidateCache() to be called under certain circumstances and
        thus the named element cache object can become invalid while
        updateNamedElementCache() is populating it.

        To avoid the issue, this patch updates updateNamedElementCache() so that the
        named element cache map is set *after* traversing the DOM tree. This way,
        hasNamedElementCache() returns false while the cache is being populated and
        there is no chance of it being invalidated too early.

        [CSS Blending] Webkit-blend-mode fails for accelerated parent with overflow:hidden
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126160

        When the isolating layer has overflow:hidden, it will create a descendant clipping layer
        (m_childContainmentLayer), which will restrict the bleding layer to reading the backdrop
        from the isolating layer.
        The solution in this patch is to forbid the isolating layer to create a descendant clipping
        layer and make all the children to get their own ancestor clipping layers instead.

        [CSS Regions] Elements with overflow:auto are not painted inside regions when following a float
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131161

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        When a float-avoiding element (such as overflow:auto) is flowed into a flow thread after a float, its 
        logical left is not set on its frameRect or its layer's topLeft, but is instead kept in its RenderBoxRegionInfo
        structure. In some situation, this causes paint rejection to kick-in because intersecting the layer's rect
        (which DOESN'T contain the logical left from the region info object) with the computed background rect 
        (which contains the logical left from the region info object) results in an empty rect.

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie.

        In case a box didn't have a range, getRegionRangeForBox was searching for
        the top-most unplittable ancestor. This is not correct in every case. It's
        possible to have a box with range that has children without ranges (e.g. an
        absolutely positioned inline box with shadow descendants).

        I've modified getRegionRangeForBox to search for the first ancestor that
        has a cached range and use that instead of looking for an unsplittable box.
        The range of the box is the region at the top of the box, clamped by the
        range of the ancestor. This will be correct all the time once all the layout
        systems are region range aware and are able to cache it.

        If we are going to return true from the shouldUseCredentialStorage callback then we don't
        really need to have CFNetwork/Foundation call us. We can just disable the callback and
        CFNetwork will assume true. Add a separate subclass that implements this callback when we
        need to return false. We can also eliminate the corresponding async callbacks. This avoids
        pingponging between dispatch queue and main thread in the common case.

        <rdar://problem/16613039>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Prior to this change, topContentInset was implemented by positioning 
        RenderLayerCompositor’s m_rootContentLayer based on the inset value. In order to 
        ensure that no content is displayed in the inset area when we are pinned to the 
        top of the page, we’ll have to take a different approach. In this patch, when you 
        are pinned to the top of the page, the m_rootContentLayer is positioned at (0,0), 
        much like it would be without an inset, but the m_clip layer IS positioned at (0, 
        topContentInset). Then for all y-scroll values between 0 and topContentInset, the 
        positions of the clip layer and the contents layer are adjusted so that the clip 
        layer approaches a position of (0,0), and the root layer approaches a position of 
        (0, topContentInset). This makes sure that any content above the top the document 
        is aways clipped out of the inset area.

        In order to achieve this, the scrolling thread needs to know about the 
        topContentInset, the clip layer, and the root contents layer.

        AsyncScrollingCoordinator::updateScrollingNode() now takes an additional parameter 
        for the clip layer. Also export the topContentInset symbol for UI-side 
        compositing.

        RenderSVGResourcePattern should deal in RenderElement&.

        CSS JIT: optimize direct / indirect adjacent's traversal backtracking
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132319

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        Since adjacent backtracking stack reference is pre-allocated
        in prologue in http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/166834,
        clearing stack phase is not needed. So we can drop
        JumpToClearAdjacentTail from backtracking action and simplify
        backtracking handling.
        And optimize direct / indirect adjacent's traversal backtracking by
        using appropriate backtracking height.

        When solving adjacent traversal backtracking action,
        1) When there's no descendant relation on the right, traversal
        failure becomes global failure.
        2) When `tagNameMatchedBacktrackingStartHeightFromDescendant` ==
        `heightFromDescendant` + 1, the descendant backtracking starts with
        the parent of the current element. So we can use the current element
        and the backtracking action is JumpToDescendantTreeWalkerEntryPoint.
        3) Otherwise, currently we take the conservative approach,
        JumpToDescendantTail.

        NOTE:
        And if `hasDescendantRelationOnTheRight` is true and there's no child
        fragment on the right, the backtracking element register is not
        effective. So we should ensure that fragment doesn't use the
        backtracking element register. Such a fragment fulfills the following
        conditions. 1. tagNameMatchedBacktrackingStartHeightFromDescendant is
        always 1 (tagNames.size(), that contains only descendant fragment) 2.
        heightFromDescendant is always 0 (-- See
        computeBacktrackingHeightFromDescendant implementation) Therefore such
        a fragment's action always becomes
        JumpToDescendantTreeWalkerEntryPoint. So we can ensure that the
        backtracking element register is not used.

        Shortcircuit shouldUseCredentialStorage callback

        <rdar://problem/16806708>

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        If we are going to return true from the shouldUseCredentialStorage callback then we don't
        really need to have CFNetwork/Foundation call us. We can just disable the callback and
        CFNetwork will assume true. Add a separate subclass that implements this callback when we
        need to return false. We can also eliminate the corresponding async callbacks. This avoids
        pingponging between dispatch queue and main thread in the common case.

        No new tests because no change in functionality.

        Updating the tiling area of content TileControllers while
        CSS animations are running depends on GraphicsLayerUpdater
        triggering repeated layer flushes. With UI-side compositing, those
        flushes were happening, but nothing triggered RemoteLayerTreeDrawingArea
        to flush changes to the UI process.

        than just doing a flush, in response to GraphicsLayerUpdater.
        
        Also change the name of the GraphicsLayerUpdaterClient function
        to indicate that it suggests that a flush is required soon, rather than
        that the flushing has to be synchronous.

        [iOS WK2] Don't create backing store for -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch that can't scroll

        <rdar://problem/16758041>

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Previously, -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch would cause us to make compositing
        layers for any element that had overflow: auto or scroll on either axis. This
        created lots of backing store when not required.
        
        Improve this to only create compositing for scrolling when there is actually
        scrollable overflow. This makes things slightly more complex, because we can
        only know when layout is up to date.

        Don't always make backing store for -webkit-backface-visibility:hidden
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132420

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.
        
        Previously, -webkit-backface-visibility:hidden unconditionally created
        compositing layers with backing store. This results in high memory use
        on pages with this style applied to many elements (a cargo-cult "optimization").
        
        Fix by only having -webkit-backface-visibility:hidden create compositing layers
        if some ancestor has a 3D transform. That's the only scenario in which the
        element can be flipped around to reveal the back side, so the only time we need
        to do compositing for this property. In future, we could be smarter, and only
        consider 3D transforms in the current preserve-3d context.

        Fix handling of attributes prior to compiling shader
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132430

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        WebGL programs that called bindAttribLocations prior to compiling shader sources
        would perform the bind using the non-hashed symbol name, but would later create
        the attributes as hashed names. Consequently, the program would refer to
        attributes that were never actually part of any shader, resulting in some amazing
        display artifacts.

        This patch adds a dictionary of hashed symbol names so that we can tell the WebGL
        program the proper name that will be used when the shader is eventually compiled,
        allowing the WebGL program to link against the proper symbol after compiling and
        linking completes.

        We set the size of the scrolling layer (which becomes the bounds of

        size of the contents layer is an integral-snapped scroll size.
        This would result in a fractional difference between the two, which
        makes us thing that the element is scrollable when it really is not.
        
        Fix by setting the size of the scroll layer to pixel snapped client size,

        In WebKitVideoSink we announce the usage of GstMetaVideo, but we do

        This patch enables the use of GstMetaVideo through the GstVideoFrame
        API. And it is used everywhere the buffer mapping is required.

        Also this patch changes to nullptr where zeros were used.

        Also, compile conditionally the video buffer conversion when it is

        [New Multicolumn] Implement support for compositing

        (WebCore::RenderMultiColumnSet::endFlow):
        Don't pad out to a multiple of column height. You can't flip around a flow thread
        to get back to accurate physical coordinates if bogus padding is introduced. This
        seemed to have no effect on any layout tests when removed, so I don't think it 
        was really serving any useful purpose.

        (WebCore::RenderMultiColumnSet::columnTranslationForOffset):
        Don't factor in the overall flow thread portion, since this is handled by the callers
        now.

        (WebCore::RenderMultiColumnSet::adjustRegionBoundsFromFlowThreadPortionRect):
        * rendering/RenderMultiColumnSet.h:
        Change this function to be ASSERT_NOT_REACHED(), since we want to know if someone calls
        it. It only runs for named flow thread compositing code, so it would be a mistake if
        this ever gets invoked.

        JSProxies should be cacheable
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132351

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        No new tests.

        Whenever we encounter a proxy in an inline cache we should try to cache on the 
        proxy's target instead of giving up.

        This patch adds support for a simple "recursive" inline cache if the base object
        we're accessing is a pure forwarding proxy. JSGlobalObject and its subclasses 
        are the only ones to benefit from this right now.

        This is performance neutral on the benchmarks we track. Currently we won't
        cache on JSDOMWindow due to HasImpureGetOwnPropertySlot, but this issue will be fixed soon.

        ScriptExecutionContext::Task should work well with C++11 lambdas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129795

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Instead of having classes that subclass ScriptExecutionContext::Task and override
        the performTask(ScriptExecutionContext*) method, have the ScriptExecutionContext::Task
        take in a std::function<void (ScriptExecutionContext*)>-like object trough the constructor
        which would contain the code currently kept in the performTask() methods.

        This enables inlining C++11 lambdas into ScriptExecutionContext::postTask() calls. For
        cleanup tasks, the Task object can be implicitly constructed by using the initializer list
        constructor with the first argument being the ScriptExecutionContext::Task::CleanupTask tag.
        The ScriptExecutionContext class remains non-copyable and now stores the passed-in invokable
        object in the std::function wrapper, along with a boolean member that indicates whether the
        task is of cleanup nature.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132337

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        From Blink r154582 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>

        This is a regression from the changes in OrderIterator. The issue is
        that we don't invalidate our iterator when a child is removed. This
        means that we could hold onto free'd memory until the next layout
        when we will recompute the iterator.

        The solution is simple: just clear the memory when we remove a child.

        Note that RenderGrid is not impacted by this bug as we don't use the
        iterator outside layout yet, but if we do it at some point the very same
        problem will arise, so the same treatment was applied to the class.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch introduces a class CSSToLengthConversionData to wrap the
        data required to convert CSS lengths to Lengths. This simplifies the
        plumbing that goes on whenever we need to resolve CSS lengths and
        makes it easier to update the arguments needed for resolving these (in
        particular adding a RenderView for resolving viewport units at style
        recalc time; removing the computingFontSize bool also appears
        possible).

        Note that the zoom argument, which was previously a float in some

        The polygon algorithm for computing excluded intervals now ignores horizontal
        edges. It also ignores edges whose lower vertex matches the top of the line, if

        [CSS Regions] Fix getClientRects() for content nodes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117407

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch modifies getClientRects() to return a list of fragments
        for a fragmented box instead of a single rectangle positioned inside
        the region where the box center would appear.

        The approach is to split the border box of the element in regions using
        the layout positioning. Then each fragment is mapped to the view coordinates
        and the result added to the list of rectangles. To preserve the originating
        region when mapping the fragment through the ancestor tree I've introduced
        the concept of a current region. The current region is stored inside a
        CurrentRenderRegionMaintainer object, created whenever an algorithm needing
        it needs to run. When the maintainer is destroyed, the cleanup is made
        automatically. The RenderFlowThread holds a pointer to this structure for
        easy access.

        SelectorCodeGenerator::generateElementIsNthChild() leaks the parent register :nth-child() is non-filtering

        In two cases, the parent register was never returned to the register allocator:
        -Non filtering selectors (the early return).
        -Non marking selectors (at the moment: only querySelector API).

        Unfortunately, generateElementIsNthChild() makes function call, which forces us to do this manual allocation
        of the parentElement register. Long term, I want RegisterAllocator and FunctionCall to have a special type for that.

        Calculate appropriate backtracking start height from the closest

        1. When backtracking start height equals to current height, we
        can simply jump to a descendant element check phase.
        2. When backtracking start height equals to current height + 1, we
        can simply jump to a descendant element traversing phase.

        We can apply this optimization to fragments with adjacent combinators.
        But, in the meantime, we start to implement it for a fragment with

        OrderIterator refactoring to avoid extra loops
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119061

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch removes order values Vector and use a Vector of pairs instead. The pairs are formed by a child
        (RenderBox) and the index of this child. In addition, OrderIterator code is simplified.

        It provides a helper class OrderIteratorPopulator, used for manipulating the Vector directly. Which allows to
        consolidate the code into a single implementation across flexbox and grid. OrderIteratorPopulator part is based
        on a patch from Blink r153971 by <jchaffraix@chromium.org>.

        Current implementation is O(number of children * number of order values). Now it will just do a sort operation
        and then a regular loop. So if you have different order values in a flexbox or grid the performance will
        improve.

        Comparing results of perf-tests:
        * Layout/auto-grid-lots-of-data: ~0.5% worse.
        * Layout/fixed-grid-lots-of-data: ~0.5% worse.
        * Layout/fixed-grid-lots-of-data (setting 100 different order values): ~50% better.
        * Layout/flexbox-lots-of-data: ~5% better.

        (WebCore::OrderIterator::currentChild): Return current child according to m_childrenIndex.

        ScriptExecutionContext::Task should work well with C++11 lambdas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129795

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Instead of having classes that subclass ScriptExecutionContext::Task and override
        the performTask(ScriptExecutionContext*) method, have the ScriptExecutionContext::Task
        take in a std::function<void (ScriptExecutionContext*)>-like object trough the constructor
        which would contain the code currently kept in the performTask() methods.

        This enables inlining C++11 lambdas into ScriptExecutionContext::postTask() calls. For
        cleanup tasks, the Task object can be implicitly constructed by using the initializer list
        constructor with the first argument being the ScriptExecutionContext::Task::CleanupTask tag.
        The ScriptExecutionContext class remains non-copyable and now stores the passed-in invokable
        object in the std::function wrapper, along with a boolean member that indicates whether the
        task is of cleanup nature.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Implementation of the grid-template shorthand.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128980

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This shorthand sets the values for the grid-template-columns,
        grid-template-rows and grid-template-areas, so the implementation
        tries to reuse as much available parsing functions as possible.

        The "parsingGridTrackList" was refactored to return a CSSValue and
        let the "parseValue" function to assign the property value. The
        "forwardSlash" operator is now valid when the track-list clause is
        part of a shorthand. The "parseValue" function checkouts that only
        additional clauses are allowed when processing shorthands; the
        grid-columns-rows-get-set.html tests was modified to verify this.

        The "parseGridTemplateAreas" was refactored too, in order to
        process single areas's rows. This is very useful for the
        gris-template secondary syntax, which mixes areas and rows values.

        Finally, the "parseGirdLineNames" function was modified as well by
        defining an new argument to concatenate head/tail custom-ident
        elements and ensure the identList is at the heading index, since
        it's now possible the parseList was rewound.

        The implementation of the grid-template shorthand tries first to
        match the <grid-template-columns> / <grid-template-rows> syntax,
        failing back to the secondary syntax if needed.  This approach
        requires to rewind the parseList but it produces a clearer code.

        This eliminates the need to repeat boilerplate.

        The fix for the above bug was to correct mistaken logic where JSSVGElementInstance
        had a visitChildren that did not properly mark event listeners because it explicitly

        Make sure RenderMultiColumnFlowThreads just return null for regions at any

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The regression was caused by two bugs:
        1. The event didn't stop propagating itself even when it should.
           If the related target is same as the event origin, the event propagation should stop when the event reaches
           the root of the related target's tree scope. Otherwise, it should stop when it reaches the related target.

        2. Mouse event's related target exposed nodes inside a user-agent shadow DOM when the related target appeared
           inside the origin.

        Fixed the bugs by re-introducing path shrinkage algorithm removed in r157328 into EventPath::setRelatedTarget
        and adding an algorithm to determine the least common ancestor of the related target and the current target
        in moveToParentOrShadowHost. The latter algorithm doesn't match the shadow DOM specification:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-shadow-dom-20130514/

        REGRESSION (r151839): Subframe keeps getting mousemove events with the same coordinates after hiding a hovered element.
        <https://webkit.org/b/131974>
        <rdar://problem/15907469>

        When the currently hovered element disappears as a result of style recalc,
        we send a fake mousemove event to the page, to see if anything newly added
        should become hovered.

        The faking mechanism lives in EventHandler and simply synthesizes a new
        mousemove event using the last seen mouse location.

        The problem here is that we were sending this fake mousemove event to the
        subframe where the hovered element lived. Since subframes aren't kept up
        to date on recent mouse locations, this could cause some strange behavior
        where a subframe would dispatch mousemove events with stale coordinates.

        The solution is to always dispatch fake mousemove events from the main
        frame's event handler. This is how real event delivery happens, and hit
        testing will then find the appropriate subframe, if any.

        [CSS Regions] Selection highlight doesn't match DOM selection
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131511

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch implements a subtrees approach to fix selection interaction in CSS Regions.

        The idea is to divide the Render tree in subtrees. One subtree will be the RenderView (which is always present),
        then for each RenderNamedFlowThread (which are children of RenderView) we will have an extra subtree.

        For each subtree it determines the start and end positions according to the DOM tree. So, every subtree will
        always have a start and end position, and the selection algorithm will be able to reach the end from the start
        without problems (this allows us to remove the changes introduced in r155058).

        Then selection related methods in RenderView are adapted to ensure that they are called for each subtree. Making
        the selection highlight to match DOM selection as expected.

        Calling setNeedsLayout() is not sufficient when the topContentInset has changed

        This works completely when the inset changes due to entering/exiting fullscreen,

        [New Multicolumn] Pagination mode messed up with non-inline axis and reversed direction.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131811

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        Added fast/multicol/newmulticol/compare-with-old-impl/BottomToTop-tb.html
        
        With block axis pagination mode, it is possible to set a column height that is not the same
        as the available fill height for a block. The new multi-column code had the assumption that
        the column height was the same as the amount of fill room you had available. This is not
        the case.
        
        To correct the issue, I added a member variable to RenderMultiColumnSet that stores the
        available column height as a separate variable from the computed column height. This allows
        the pagination API to specify a different column height that is not the same as the view's
        content height.

        Even though it isn't involved in the solution, I also patched pageOrViewLogicalHeight on
        RenderView to work with the new column code as well.

        To address the layout test failures (that caused the previous rollout), I made sure to
        initialize m_availableHeight to 0 when m_computedColumnHeight also gets reset to 0.
        
        The assertion is not something I could reproduce on any machine, but I can see the problem.
        I patched Page's pageCount method to not have column code directly in Page.cpp, 
        and to make a new pageCount() method on RenderView that Page calls
        into. This method is now patched to handle the new column code as well as the old. I have
        no real way of testing this method though, since I can't reproduce the assertion that the
        bots were experiencing.

        There is no need for separate localization files

        Ultimately I think we want a top-level WebKit object that
        hold the table, but for now use a global variable
        called UIStringTable. Since we're in an isolated world, we
        won't clash with anything.

        I noticed a few cases were we grab a localized string and
        then instantly run a replacement on it. This should be

        Compile the :root pseudo class and fix a related issue with :nth-child()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131926

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Add the :root pseudo class. This is another trivial selector, we just need to compare
        the element pointer with the documentElement.

        I discovered some issues with :nth-child(n) through the layout tests for ":root".
        When the pseudo class nth-child could match anything, no code was generated. That decision
        was taken when generating the fragments.

        The specification of :nth-child() has two tests: the parent test and the counter test.
        Since some fragments would not generate any code for :nth-child(n), they would succeed on the root,
        which is incorrect since the root should fail the parent test.

        This was fixed by moving the filtering of non-counting :nth-child() after we generate the parent
        check.
        We still don't generate any counter test unless required.

        ScriptExecutionContext::stopActiveDOMObjects iterates a hash map that can change during iteration (for multiple reasons, including GC)
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52719

        Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

        At least two specific ways this can happen:

        1) XMLHttpRequest::stop can trigger a JavaScript garbage collection.
        2) NotificationCenter::stop can delete the last references to notifications;
           those notifications are also active DOM objects.

        Besides fixing the iteration in that function, did some other fixes for the
        ScriptExecutionContext class, including some coding style changes. Many uses
        of nullptr instead of 0, without listing each function separately below.

        * Modules/webdatabase/DatabaseContext.cpp:
        (WebCore::DatabaseContext::contextDestroyed): Call through to the base class
        version of contextDestroyed rather than repeating what it does (with a large

        Wrote out "private" explicitly for deriving from ActiveDOMObject. Made the
        ActiveDOMObject function overrides private, and marked them override and final.

        * dom/ActiveDOMObject.h: Updated comments. Replaced suspendIfNeededCalled with
        assertSuspendIfNeededWasCalled, which has an empty inline version in the header.
        Renamed m_suspendIfNeededCalled to m_suspendIfNeededWasCalled.

        * dom/ActiveDOMObject.cpp:

        function into its one call site, ScriptExecutionContext::stopActiveDOMObjects,
        since it's simple enough when written as a C++11 for loop.
        (WebCore::ScriptExecutionContext::hasPendingActivity): Added. This function was
        already exported for workers, and implementing it outside this class required
        exposing the private HashSet members; more sensible to implement it here and
        simply make it public in WorkerGlobalScope.

        * dom/ScriptExecutionContext.h: Removed unnecessary includes and forward declarations.
        Removed a long-ago-fixed FIXME. Changed various functions to take references instead of
        pointers. Added a protected hasPendingActivity function, deleted the closeMessagePorts

        !ASSERT_DISABLED only, and deleted the messagePorts and activeDOMObjects functions.

        in the base class.

        [UI-side compositing] Implement blend modes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131891
        <rdar://problem/16490085>

        Implement blend modes with UI-side compositing.
        
        PlatformCALayer::setBlendMode() becomes pure virtual, and overridden in
        PlatformCALayerMac and PlatformCALayerRemote.
        PlatformCAFilters::setBlendingFiltersOnLayer() now takes a raw platform
        layer, so it can be called from the UI process on a CALayer*.
        
        Fix an issue with GraphicsLayerCA::LayerChange flags. 1 << 31 shifts
        a signed integer, so it ended up setting all the high bits in m_uncommittedChanges,
        causing us to push blend modes to the UI process for every layer. Fix by shifting
        an unsigned long long (1LLU << 31). This should also fix a build warning on Windows.

        Contents of directly composited image layers are sometimes missing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131880

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.
        
        RenderLayerBacking::updateGraphicsLayerGeometry() tested whether a
        GraphicsLayer had a contents layer to determine whether to call code
        that updates the contents rect. However, on Mac, we don't make a contents
        layer until later at layer flush time. That would result in an empty
        contentsRect being set.
        
        Fix by renaming GraphicsLayer::hasContentsLayer() to usesContentsLayer(),
        and on Mac consulting the m_contentsLayerPurpose flag, which is set
        at the appropriate time.

        Page throttlers were being created for SVG images and other page instances that
        were not accurately tracking the states that enable and disable page throttling.
        Make the throttler an unique ptr and only initialize it for WebKit2.

        This also fixes an inefficiency where we would throttle a new page on creation because 
        we assumed it was visible even if that was not the case.

        DOM timer throttling is currently part of the page throttler which uses per process 
        state and per page state to determine when to throttle.  This led us to being overly 
        conservative when turning DOM throttling off.  It should only respond to view state changes.

        Additionally since creating extra page throttlers SVG images caused bugs 
        in tracking state we'll reserve the page throttler for WebKit2 views.  To avoid regressing 
        WebKit1 we should move DOM timer throttling back to the page.

        With block axis pagination mode, it is possible to set a column height that is not the same
        as the available fill height for a block. The new multi-column code had the assumption that
        the column height was the same as the amount of fill room you had available. This is not
        the case.
        
        To correct the issue, I added a member variable to RenderMultiColumnSet that stores the
        available column height as a separate variable from the computed column height. This allows
        the pagination API to specify a different column height that is not the same as the view's
        content height.

        Even though it isn't involved in the solution, I also patched pageOrViewLogicalHeight on
        RenderView to work with the new column code as well.

        When an element has multiple animations that have different timingFunctions,
        the progress of each animation should be calculated using its respective
        timingFunction. But at this point, the timingFunction of the first animation is
        only used in RenderLayerBacking::startAnimation(), regardless of how many
        animations the element has.

        getAnimationFromStyleByName() was introduced in r89462 so that the
        timingFunction of the correct animation searched by its name would be

        topContentInset() has to be factored into all of these conversions.

        [New Multicolumn] columnNumberForOffset is not patched for new multicolumn code yet.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131740

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.
        
        I took the opportunity to clean this code up while adding support for the new columns.
        columnNumberForOffset only applied for paginated RenderViews and was really about
        pages and not columns. It also only returns an actual page number if the columns are
        block progressed (e.g., right-to-left vertical Japanese books).
        
        Therefore I renamed columnNumberForOffset to pageNumberForBlockProgressionOffset and
        moved it to RenderView.
        
        I also renamed the member variable of SelectionRect to be pageNumber instead of
        columnNumber in order to make it more obvious that this isn't about columns per se
        (since the fact that we implemented RenderView's pagination mode using columns is an
        implementation detail).

        Fullscreen media controls are unusable in pagination mode
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131705

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When pagination mode is enabled, the full screen media will (depending on the width of the
        pagination columns) overflow its column, and hit testing will be clipped to the column. In extreme
        cases, where the column width < 0.5 * media element width, the media controls will be entirely
        unclickable.

        Rather than making the RenderFullScreen a child of the full screen element's parent's renderer,
        make it a child of the RenderView, putting it outside of the columns entirely. Always create and
        insert the fullscreenRenderer's placeholder, using it as the remembered insertion point for the
        fullscreen element's renderer when we exit full screen.

        Drive-by fix: don't wrap the full screen element's renderer in webkitWillEnterFullScreenForElement();
        it will just be re-wrapped in createRendererIfNeeded().

        Do not use the OverlapMap in RenderLayerCompositor::computeCompositingRequirements if the layer already
        has a 3D transform. This way we can avoid a potential expensive lookups when we know for sure the layer
        is already supposed to be composited. 

        Also, added a bounding box of the overlap map, so that it can catch cases when the new layer is not overlapping
        any of the previous layers. This is pretty common when having composited layers laid out in a vertical/horizontal list.

        Web Replay: memoize fallback time values for document.lastModified
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131318

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        If a document's Last-Modified header can't be found or used, then 
        document.lastModified is derived from the current system time or
        from filesystem data, which is obviously nondeterministic.

        It's better to handle this inside Document::lastModified rather than using
        MemoizedDOMResult, because only the fallback case is nondeterministic.

        Test: http/tests/inspector/replay/document-last-modified-fallback-value.html

        The test is skipped for now, as it will be very flaky without the
        functionality introduced by bugs 130728 and 129391.

        [New Multicolumn] Add support for column-span:all
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129330

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        Column spanners are implemented as siblings of RenderMultiColumnSet
        objects (i.e. the regions for the column rows). This means that they
        are pulled out from the flow thread tree where they would otherwise
        live. This causes some complexity, most of which is contained within
        the multicol code.

        A placeholder is put in the flow thread tree where the spanner's
        renderer would otherwise live. This is needed in order make sure that
        we interrupt line layout before after the spanner. We also need this
        to be able to switch from one multicol set to the next.

        Some extra logic is required when dynamically inserting and removing
        flow thread descendants now, because we need to figure out if the
        renderer added should trigger creation of new multi column sets. If
        a spanner is inserted in the middle of a multi column set, we need to
        detect this, split the set and put the spanner in the middle.

        Wrote a bunch of tests. A few of the tests were copied from existing
        (old-impl) tests and put in a separate directory. That directory can
        be wiped when we turn on the new multicol implementation by default.

        [iOS WK2] Pages often blank on first load if page loaded by typing the URL
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131665

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The document overlay-related code in RemoteLayerTreeDrawingArea::setRootCompositingLayer()
        was triggering a compositing layer flush when called with a null rootLayer, which happens
        for pages going into the page cache. This would trigger a layer flush that would clobber
        the root layer for the visible page, resulting in missing content.
        
        Also, rebuildCompositingLayerTree() is called recursively and the m_documentOverlayRootLayer
        was being added to (and then removed from) every single compositing layers.
        
        Fix both these by changing to a pull model, where RenderLayerCompositor requests
        the overlay layer via ChromeClient, and gets it at the end of every flush,
        adding to the children of the root layer.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The document overlay-related code in RemoteLayerTreeDrawingArea::setRootCompositingLayer()
        was triggering a compositing layer flush when called with a null rootLayer, which happens
        for pages going into the page cache. This would trigger a layer flush that would clobber
        the root layer for the visible page, resulting in missing content.
        
        Also, rebuildCompositingLayerTree() is called recursively and the m_documentOverlayRootLayer
        was being added to (and then removed from) every single compositing layers.
        
        Fix both these by changing to a pull model, where RenderLayerCompositor requests
        the overlay layer via ChromeClient, and gets it at the end of every flush,
        adding to the children of the root layer.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Optimize fill() and fillRect() operations in Canvas on composited contexts by
        10 to 20 times on CG.

        Replacing the ImageBuffer code by transparency layers allows the
        graphics library to optimize the drawing.

        Doing the same for drawImage() would give performance regressions.

        An inline function will create a transparency layer for CG. Cairo graphics
        does not composite correctly when a transparency layer gets created. 
        The inline function is just a NOOP for Cairo.

        CSS JIT: compile the :nth-child() pseudo class

        (WebCore::CSSSelector::RareData::parseNth):
        While working on the patch, I discovered some severe issues with the parsing of large
        values of a and/or b. The problem comes from the way the CSS parser handle the values:
        the values are parsed as a double then converted to an AtomicString for CSSSelector.

        There are many problems related to large values but we never got bug reports because
        they are very uncommon. Fixing those problem would require changing the parser.

        Here, CSSSelector::RareData::parseNth() is hardened a little bit to avoid absurd values
        of a and b.

        The last part compares the number of previous siblings to an+b to find if the filter matches.

        The only part that diverges from SelectorChecker is how childIndex is used. Instead of testing it

        Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

        QuickLookHandle should not be responsible for saving a copy of the
        original document to disk as it might be running in a process that
        either can't write to disk or can only write into a sandboxed

        quick look conversion from that of original document saving so that
        each activity can run in the appropriate process.

        Created a new interface between WebCore and WebKit by adding a client
        (QuickLookHandleClient) to QuickLookHandle which is notified of incoming
        bytes. A new function on FrameLoaderClient tells WebKit when a new
        QuickLookHandle is created, giving WebKit the opportunity to register a
        handle client. Moved the existing file system-related code as well as

        Make NodeList.length inline-cacheable by JSC.
        <https://webkit.org/b/131579>

        For objects with custom index or name getters, we have to make sure
        that builtin properties take precedence. We do this by scanning the
        ancestor chain for a suitable property slot before moving on to
        named items.

        With this patch, we now mark such builtins as cacheable. This is
        safe since the whole point of doing this before processing named
        items is to ensure the same slot is returned consistently.

        This is a port of a Blink patch by kenrb@chromium.org.

        During RenderInline::splitFlow(), floats are cleared on an anonymous
        containingBlock() for the inline being split. This is a problem if
        siblings of the block contain references to the same floats, since the

        find them.

        This change also affects RenderBlock::splitFlow() and

        JSMainThreadExecState::call() should clear exceptions before returning.
        <https://webkit.org/b/131530>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Test: fast/dom/regress-131530.html

        Previously, JSMainThreadExecState::call() did not clear any pending
        exceptions in the VM before returning.  On returning, the
        JSMainThreadExecState destructor may re-enter the VM to notify
        MutationObservers.  This may result in a crash because the VM expects
        exceptions to be cleared at entry.

        We now change JSMainThreadExecState::call() to return the exception
        (if present) via an argument, and clear it from the VM before returning.

        As part of this change, I updated various parts of the code base to use the
        new API as needed.

        - Document.open() cannot be the first function on the JS stack.  Hence,
          there is no need to use JSMainThreadExecState to call into the VM, as
          this is only needed to catch the event of returning from the first
          function for the purpose of notifying MutationObservers.  Change to
          call JSC::call() directly.

        - Added an assert to verify that the task does not return with an
          unhandled exception.  Currently, the only Microtask in use is for the
          Promise implementation, which will eat the exception before returning.
          This assertion is added here to verify that this contract does not
          inadvertantly change in the future.
        (WebCore::JSMainThreadExecState::JSMainThreadExecState):

        This patch adds guards to headers that are only required by generated replay code
        that is itself guarded. Other ports probably haven't added the headers to their
        build files, so we don't want to emit the unused header includes.

        This patch also converts generated uses of DEFINE_STATIC_LOCAL to NeverDestroyed<T>.

        Web Inspector: Remove shared PageScriptDebugServer, create per-Page
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131523

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Having a shared PageScriptDebugServer was causing issues when we called
        JSC::Debugger::clearBreakpoints() closing one inspector while another
        is open for another WebCore::Page in the same process. Having the same
        JSC::Debugger underlying multiple InspectorDebuggerAgent instances
        means that when clearBreakpoints is called, the real JSC breakpoints
        underlying other InspectorDebuggerAgent's get removed. When those
        InspectorDebuggerAgents attempt to remove their breakpoints they
        encounter unexpected issues.

        This entirely rebuilds PageScriptDebugServer to be per-Page instead
        of shared across all pages. So take this opportunity to move the
        file from WebCore/bindings/js to WebCore/inspector.

        We're ending up in RenderBlock::splitBlocks() with |this| ==
        |fromBlock|.  We then try to climb the ancestor block chain from
        this->parent() to |fromBlock|, but this->parent() is already above
        |fromBlock|, so we end up climbing up to the RenderView and trying to
        clone it, causing the assertion failure.

        Adopt Chromium's mitigation for this from
        <https://codereview.chromium.org/13852041>. This is not intended as a
        fix for the underlying issue.

        Also, fix another issue that occurs with this fuzzed test case that's
        not handled by the Chromium fix.

        Ensure while we're in the loop that |curr| is a descendant of
        |fromBlock|. From the Chromium patch:

            We need to check in every iteration of the loop because
            moveChildrenTo could have moved |curr|. This is a mitigation and
            not really a fix against a class of tree craziness.

        Finally, before moving children from |fromBlock| to |toBlock|, ensure
        that the children are children of |fromBlock|. If we never entered the
        loop, they will be siblings of |fromBlock|, not children.

        Web Replay: memoize plugin data for navigator.mimeTypes and navigator.plugins
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131341

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Information about plugins and mime types is nondeterministic and can change
        at any time, whether by system events, browser settings changes, or
        triggered by script. To avoid interposing on all those code paths, just
        memoize the plugin data used by DOMPluginArray and DOMMimeTypeArray.

        This is less efficient than controlling mutations to the underlying PluginData
        of a Page, but that can be done later if better plugin support is desired.
        The point of this change is to make analytics trackers deterministic across
        enabling/disabling of plugins.

        Renamed performDrag to performDragOperation. This function is responsible for
        accepting a drop, not for the whole drag.

        The new name is not perfect either, but I think that it's better, and at least
        it matches AppKit, like the other dragging destination functions already do.

        [CSS Regions] Monolithic elements should not affect the layout of the content outside its region
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130499

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        When performing layout on an element flowed into regions, its logical height must not be incremented 
        past the region's logical bottom for monolithic elements in regions different than the last region their containing
        block is fragmented into. This ensures that the following elements are correctly laid out 
        from the top of the next region.
        This change must also be applied to floats in order to prevent text from avoiding part
        of a float that did not actually made it into the current region, but instead overflowed
        the previous one.

        The algorithm for this computation, implemented in RenderFlowThread::getRegionRangeForBox,
        walks up the render tree trying to find the top-most unsplittable box under the named flow
        in the case where the region ranges information is not available.

        As this traversal works properly only when the starting box is not detached from the render tree,
        i changed the named flow information clearing in RenderBlock::collapseAnonymousBoxChild

        In r155998 we started to compute a root-relative transform in order to choose
        a good contentsScale to avoid blurring on scaling.
        
        However, the code failed to update this transform when passing over
        GraphicsLayerCAs with no uncommitted changes, which caused us to choose
        an incorrect contentsScale sometimes, resulting in blurriness.
        
        Fix by updating the root-relative transform on layers with no uncommitted
        changes.

        [New Multicolumn] Child top margin sometimes ignored for column balancing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122754

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        We need to set zero page logical height in LayoutState when column
        height is unknown (when the columns haven't yet been
        balanced). There's code that assumes that non-zero page height means
        that page height is known. Lying about this makes the pagination code
        believe that every top margin is adjacent to a column break, which
        makes it eat and ignore all top margins.

        This should be cleaned up, but it's easier to wait until the old
        multicol code has been removed.

        Fixed positioned elements that have the named flow as parent are positioned
        and sized relative to the viewport. Because of that, when the named flow
        has an associated region chain, the fixed positioned elements should not
        be fragmented.

        By making a fixed positioned element with a named flow parent unsplittable

        Split CSS Selectors pseudo class and pseudo elements

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Split pseudo class and pseudo element to make it clearer what pseudo types
        are possible for a given match type.

        Pseudo Element types are separated and Pseudo Class are left in place. The Pseudo Class
        will have to be renamed too but that will be done separately to make this change smaller.

        Web Replay: detect possible replay divergence from unexpected DOM event dispatches
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131193

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Add assertions to catch potential nondeterministic behavior.

        The assertion added by this patch catches dispatched DOM events
        that are triggered by nondeterministic event loop cycles. If we
        did not capture an event loop input in the current event loop
        cycle nor are we manually simulating an event loop input during
        playback, then DOM events fired during the unordered cycle could
        run JavaScript and diverge the execution.

        During playback, we can assert that EventLoopInputDispatcher is dispatching
        when a DOM event is be dispatched to a document that is being replayed.

        During capturing, event loop inputs are captured rather than
        dispatched, so we add some accounting to track what caused a DOM
        event. To approximate the extent of computation triggered by an
        event loop input, we add RAII helpers to call sites where event
        loop inputs are captured.

        The assertions are disabled by default until the most common
        sources of nondeterminism are handled and playback errors are
        gracefully surfaced to the user. <https://webkit.org/b/131279>

        No new tests. This patch adds extra assertions for debugging purposes.

        RenderRegion method isValid() should be used to test whether a region
        is good to use instead of a mix between isValid() and flowThread().
        When the region is designed to fragment content from a parent flow thread,
        the m_flowThread is not nullified anymore, thus ensuring the same treatment for all invalid
        regions.

        New unit test in TestWebKitAPI.

        Changed the classes related to CSS "calc" to make the code a bit easier to read by
        moving code out of class definitions. Also used final some more, made more things private,
        used references instead of pointers, and other such changes. Biggest change, though, is to
        Length, which had a broken system for managing reference counted calculated objects.
        There were multiple bugs including a basic design mistake of not having a reference count
        and trying to use the reference count in the object itself. Fixed and covered by the unit
        test now; test found multiple problems in both the old and new implementations.

        * WebCore.exp.in: Updated exports, including symbols to make the unit test practical.

        * WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Made CalculationValue.h a Private file so it can
        be used in a unit test. Also let Xcode update the file type for a gperf file.

        * css/CSSCalculationValue.cpp:
        (WebCore::CSSCalcValue::equals): Updated since m_expression is a Ref now.
        (WebCore::CSSCalcValue::clampToPermittedRange): Marked inline and updated for data member
        name change.
        (WebCore::isIntegerResult): Changed argument order to put the operator first and use
        references instead of pointers. Also marked inline.
        (WebCore::createBlendHalf): Added. Helper to make the other functions more readable.
        (WebCore::createExpressionNode): Made non-member function private to this file. Also made
        many small improvements.
        (WebCore::CSSCalcValue::create): Updated so both of these call the same constructor.

        * css/CSSCalculationValue.h: Cut down CSSCalcValue class by making more things private
        and deleting unneeded things. Also use Ref instead of RefPtr.

        * css/CSSComputedStyleDeclaration.cpp:
        (WebCore::getPositionOffsetValue): Use isFixed function instead of type function.

        * css/CSSGradientValue.cpp:
        (WebCore::CSSGradientValue::addStops): Updated code since toCalcValue now returns PassRef
        instead of PassRefPtr. Unfortunately the new code is a bit more verbose.
        (WebCore::positionFromValue): Ditto.

        * css/CSSParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::CSSParser::parseCalculation):

        * css/CSSPrimitiveValue.cpp:
        (WebCore::CSSPrimitiveValue::CSSPrimitiveValue): Updated to pass reference rather than pointer.
        (WebCore::CSSPrimitiveValue::init): Ditto.

        * css/CSSToStyleMap.h: Removed unneeded include of LengthBox.h.

        * css/DeprecatedStyleBuilder.cpp:
        (WebCore::ApplyPropertyLength::applyValue): Updated for function name change.
        (WebCore::ApplyPropertyBorderRadius::applyValue): Removed extra parentheses.
        (WebCore::ApplyPropertyFontSize::applyValue): Ditto. Also updated since toCalcValue returns Ref.

        * css/LengthFunctions.cpp:
        (WebCore::floatValueForLength): Updated to call value instead of getFloatValue; both are the same.

        * css/StyleResolver.cpp:
        (WebCore::addIntrinsicMargins): Updated for function name change.
        (WebCore::createGridTrackBreadth): Ditto.

        * platform/CalculationValue.cpp:
        (WebCore::CalculationValue::create): Changed to return PassRef.
        (WebCore::CalcExpressionNumber::evaluate): Moved this function out of the header, since it's
        virtual and not really going to be inlined.
        (WebCore::CalcExpressionNumber::operator==): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CalculationValue::evaluate): Ditto.

        (WebCore::CalcExpressionBlendLength::evaluate): Ditto.
        (WebCore::CalcExpressionBlendLength::operator==): Ditto.

        * platform/CalculationValue.h: Moved most functions out of the class bodies so the classes are
        easier to see. Made all the == operator functions non-member ones except for the polymorphic
        one from the base class. Changed the casting functions to work on references instead of pointers.
        Tweaked name of some members.

        * platform/Length.cpp: Reworked the CalculationValueMap (formerly CalculationValueHandleMap) to
        use unsigned instead of int, and store reference counts in the map rather than trying to share the
        reference count of the underlying CalculationValue object, which can lead to storage leaks where
        handles end up in the map permanently.
        (WebCore::calculationValues): Use NeverDestroyed instead of DEPRECATED_DEFINE_STATIC_LOCAL.
        (WebCore::Length::Length): Updated some data member names.
        (WebCore::Length::calculationValue): Updated to return a reference instead of a PassRefPtr.
        (WebCore::Length::ref): Renamed and updated for new interface to the map.
        (WebCore::Length::deref): Ditto.
        (WebCore::Length::nonNanCalculatedValue): Updated to use a reference instead of a pointer.
        (WebCore::Length::isCalculatedEqual): Updated since this is now only called if both objects are
        known to be calculated values.

        * platform/Length.h: Moved most functions out of the class definition to make the class definition
        easier to read. Reworked the constructors and assignment operators to handle the reference counting
        correctly. Added various FIXMEs and assertions. Removed some unused functions, made others private.

        * platform/LengthBox.h: Renamed some one-letter arguments to use words instead.

        * rendering/AutoTableLayout.cpp:
        (WebCore::AutoTableLayout::recalcColumn): Updated for change to Length::setValue.
        * rendering/FixedTableLayout.cpp:

        * rendering/style/FillLayer.h:
        (WebCore::FillLayer::initialFillXPosition): Updated to not convert a double to a float at runtime.
        (WebCore::FillLayer::initialFillYPosition): Ditto.

        * rendering/style/RenderStyle.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderStyle::setWordSpacing): Removed a bogus FALLTHROUGH that was clearly wrong, but
        harmless. Updated for changes to Length.

        * rendering/style/RenderStyle.h: Updated for name changes and to avoid converting doubles to floats
        at runtime.

        Web Replay: add methods to encode a frame's index based on its FrameTree position
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131281

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Given a frame, its encoded index is computed by traversing the frame tree
        and saving how many nodes have been traversed to reach a given frame.

        * html/HTMLPlugInImageElement.h: Trimmed includes a bit. Made more members private.
        Marked more function members final. Made a protected imageLoader function so that

        Web Replay: capture and replay wheel events and scroll commands

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher and Simon Fraser.

        To capture and replay scrolling, the scrolling coordinator will force synchronous 
        scrolling during capture and replay. If the page is capturing or replaying,
        ForceOnMainThread will be added to the coordinator's SynchronousScrollingReasons.

        A callback was added to signal that replay session state have changed,
        and thus the synchronous scrolling reasons should be recomputed.

        Automated replay reftests for scrolling are not included, because they will be
        too flaky until more nondeterminism is handled. Specifically, resource loading,

        [CSSRegions] Region's behaviour not updated when becoming valid from invalid
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131211

        Reviewed by Andrei Bucur.

        When a region becomes valid again from invalid, it was part of a dependency cycle and the dependency cycle was broken,
        it needs to behave like a valid region again: if it has autoheight then it should compute its height based on the
        named flow content, if it has region styling then it should apply the additional style to the flowed content.

        Added a new method, updateRegionFlags, that is used to ensure that auto-height and region-styling flags
        are properly set in several situations. Checking the behaviour, autoheight or styling, is done only
        if the region is valid.

        Harden FilterOperation type casting
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131142

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        DefaultFilterOperation had an error-prone behavior where it set the base class
        OperationType to the type of some other filter class, but overrode isDefault(). 
        This made it very easy to write incorrect code that casted incorrectly based on type().
        
        Fix by making adding a DEFAULT filter operation type, and storing the represented
        type on DefaultFilterOperation().
        
        Also remove the OperationType argument for constructors of FilterOperations that
        can only be of one type, to avoid possible mistakes.
        
        Make the type cast macros a bit more normal, and use them in a few places.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129816

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The code to parse the inset rounded corners was adding the parser
        value arguments to a temporary CSSParserValueList. Unfortunately,
        CSSParserValueList expects to own the values it contains, and it frees
        the values it contains when the list is destroyed. This was a problem
        because the values are owned by the CSSParserValueList passed in to
        parseInsetRoundedCorners, and thus the calc's argument list would get
        double freed, resulting in a crash. This patch fixes this by using a

        [CSS Regions] Include region range information when printing the render tree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131159

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie.

        With this change showRenderObject() will print the region range for objects inside
        a flow thread. The format is:
        Rs: <startRegion> Re: <endRegion>

        Because this can be called anytime during debugging, it's necessary to disable the
        current flow thread caching to prevent using the wrong flow thread for an object.

        Tests: No new tests, no functional change.

        Sandbox violation in NetworkProcess when uploading a bundle

        Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

        Track generated file ownership explicitly, so that each copy of FormData would know
        whether to delete the file.

        This part is needed to prevent asserting in FormData destructor in NetworkProcess,
        because it doesn't delete the files. Also, some cleanup.

        * WebCore.exp.in: Don't export FormData::removeGeneratedFilesIfNeeded(), WebKit2
        doesn't need it any more.
        * platform/network/FormData.cpp: Removed m_hasGeneratedFiles. There is no problem
        iterating over FormDataElements to compute it, and that's more robust when FormDatas
        are passed or stored on disk permanently.
        Updated touched functions to use C++ iteration, and renamed "e" to "element".
        (WebCore::FormData::encode): Keep encoding a boolean for hasGeneratedFiles, because
        the encoded FormData can be stored persitently, and we can't change the format.

        * platform/network/FormData.h: (WebCore::FormDataElement::FormDataElement):
        Added m_ownsGeneratedFile. FormData will only delete files it owns. Since files
        are generated immediately before form submission, it's always the FormData being
        submitted that owns the generated files.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The setting Settings::maximumDecodedImageSize() and its related logic have various
        shortcomings, including the inability to cancel an image load when the estimated
        decoded image size exceeds the maximum decoded image size. In the iOS port, this
        setting is less useful given image subsampling support. For now, we remove this
        setting and its related logic. Should it turn out that such a setting is useful
        then we can implement it again taking care to address the shortcomings in the
        original design.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131020

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Remove collectInstancesForSVGElement() to avoid HashSet copies when assigning a const
        HashSet reference to a non-const HashSet reference. Instead, range-based for-loops are
        deployed to iterate directly over the const reference to HashSet that's returned by
        SVGElement::instancesForElement(). SVGElement::containingShadowRoot() return value
        is checked to see if the iteration should be performed in the first place, preserving
        the behavior of collectInstancesForSVGElement().

        Subpixel rendering: Transition class Image (and its dependencies) from int to float to enable subpixel positioned/sized images.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130643

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This is in preparation to support subpixel positioned/sized background images. While 1x bitmap images can't take
        subpixel sizing on hidpi resolutions, both generated and hidpi images can.
        This patch does not change Image behavior in general as both position and size are still snapped to integral values.  

        No change in behavior.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Attempt to reduce some ambiguity in scrolling tree terminology.
        When async scrolling occurs, there are two tasks we have to perform:
        1. Layers need to be updated to reflect the scroll
        2. WebCore state has to be updated.
        The "updateForViewport" name didn't clearly reflect which of these
        tasks was being performed, so rename it to updateLayersAfterViewportChange()
        to reflect the fact that it only does the first.
        
        Remove the Mac implementation of updateLayersAfterViewportChange(), since
        it was confsued about this, and was never called anyway.

        [GTK] [TextureMapper] Weird brightness with some videos with acceletared compositing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130665

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        When we uploaded a video texture to the mapper we were not
        considering that some videos could be decoded into a format
        without alpha component. Now we check if the video has alpha and
        if it does not, we remove the alpha flag when retrieving the
        texture from the pool. For this, the method to get the texture
        from the pool was modified to receive the flags, that is mapped to
        have alpha by default in order not to break any other existing
        code.

        Though we have a problem with AC in WTR and that makes it
        currently not testable, no new tests are needed because once this
        is fixed the current test set suffices to detect a possible
        regression in this.

        (WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamerBase::updateTexture): Check
        the video format and decide if the texture shall be pulled with

            VisibleSelection::visibleStart() and VisibleSelection::visibleEnd()
            can both cause layouts, which has the potential to invalidate any
            rendertree-based objects. This was causing a problem in
            FrameSelection::directionOfSelection(), where a reference to a
            lineBox was being held across a call to visibleEnd().

            This patch ensures that the any layout is completed before linebox
            references are retrieved.

        Web Replay: add page-level setting to bypass the MemoryCache
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130728

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        When replaying a specific Page we don't want to store its cached resources in the
        MemoryCache. This patch adds a page setting to prevent the page's resources from
        being saved in the MemoryCache.

        If Settings::usesMemoryCache() is false, page resources are given the special
        SessionID bypassCacheSessionID(). The cached resource loader and memory cache
        act as if the memory cache is disabled if the resource has this special session id.

        Hook up ReplayController to override the memory cache setting during capture/replay.

        Support form controls that may need incremental redraw

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        There are some form controls that change appearance
        over time. Expand the ControlStates so that it can
        hold a little more information, including a reference
        to the native form control. This way the Theme implementation
        can repaint the existing native control if necessary. At
        least ThemeMac was reusing a single control for painting
        all instances before this change.

        Since ControlStates is now a class, pass it around by
        reference.

        The other major change is keeping a timer to trigger a
        repaint in RenderBox, which happens if Theme/RenderTheme
        update the ControlState to request one.

        Render tree construction is O(N^2) in number of siblings

        When adding a new renderer to the tree we would search for the correct render tree
        position by traversing DOM children forward to find something that already has a renderer.
        In common case there is no such renderer. This would be repeated for each inserted renderer
        leading to O(n^2) in respect to child node count.
        
        This patch caches the computed render tree insertion position and passes it to siblings.
        Until the cached position is reached it can be used for all new renderers.

        [CSS Shapes] Remove shape-inside support
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130698

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        CSS Shapes Level 1 (CR) only contains shape-outside. We are focusing our efforts on finalizing
        the implementation of shape-outside, it's worth to remove shape-inside code at this point for now.

        A list of reasons for the removal:
          - Shape-inside is only part of Shapes Level 2, which needs to be improved on some topics.
          - Shape-inside is lack of new shapes support (e.g. inset).
          - Deprecated shapes (r165472) are removed from the code (e.g. rectangle), which affects shape-inside. 
          - The current shape-inside code spreads across the layout code.
          - The current shape-inside implementation is experimental in some areas,
            and the partially implemented code can have security implications.
          - Removal of shape-inside opens possibilities for code complexity and performance
            optimizations for shape-outside. (e.g. simpler geometry code)

        No new tests are needed.

        [CSS Grid Layout] getComputedStyle() must return the specified value for positioning properties

        the function getComputedStyle() must return the specified values
        for positioning properties, i.e, grid-{columns|rows}-{start|end}.

        We were in some cases, adjusting the style in the StyleResolver
        (for example with two opposing spans) something that is now done
        in the RenderGrid because we cannot alter the original style.

        The code moved to the renderer became more self explanatory and it
        now supports named grid areas with names ending in "-start" and

        InlineIterator position (unsigned int) variable can wrap around
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130540

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We trigger an ASSERT that occurs when we are ignoring spaces (to collapse them
        into a single whitespace mark) but then encounter a line break. Because we don't ignore
        the first space (but do ignore subsequent spaces), when we hit a newline in an RTL context
        we want to ignore that first space as well (so as not to push the text away from the right
        edge). We do this by decrementing the InlineIterator pointing to this first space, so all
        the spaces get ignored. However, if that space is the first character in a Text node, the
        decrement will try to go past the beginning of the node, and trigger an ASSERT.

        This design is not great. At some point we should rework it to more elegantly handle
        collapsing whitespace in both RTL and LTR writing modes.

        This patch adds an ASSERT earlier in this codepath to catch potential problems earlier.
        It also pulls our sentinel value out into a separate boolean to make it more clear what is
        going on.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Vertical rectangles not considered as valid grid areas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130513

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Grid areas sized as vertical rectangles were incorrectly
        considered as invalid by the parser. That's because the condition
        checking that each new row was adjacent to the previous one was
        using the first row of the currently parsed grid area instead of
        the last one.

        * html/HTMLEmbedElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLEmbedElement::parseAttribute): Simplified the code for typeAttr, turning
        it into a 1-liner. Added a FIXME in codeAttr about the fact that it does not have the
        code to trigger image loads. Changed srcAttr to call updateImageLoaderWithNewURLSoon to
        do the image loading logic.

        * html/HTMLFormControlElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::didAttachRenderers): Updated to use
        Style::queuePostResolutionCallback and use a lambda instead of a function.

        * html/HTMLObjectElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::parseAttribute):: Simplified the code for typeAttr, turning
        it into a 1-liner. Changed dataAttr to use updateImageLoaderWithNewURLSoon(). Also made
        it call setNeedsWidgetUpdate(true) unconditionally after checking carefully to see that's
        harmless if there is no renderer. Changed classidAttr to call setNeedsWidgetUpdate(true)
        unconditionally and not set m_classId.
        (WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::shouldAllowQuickTimeClassIdQuirk): Use fastGetAttribute
        instead of classId and descendantsOfType instead of getElementsByTagName.
        (WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::hasValidClassId): Use fastGetAttribute instead of classId.
        (WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::renderFallbackContent): Use imageLoader instead of m_imageLoader.

        attribute in a data member. Rearranged header, making more private, and fixing some typos,
        and doing a "using" instead of a function to disambiguate the inherited form functions.

        * html/HTMLPlugInImageElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::HTMLPlugInImageElement): Initialize m_needsImageReload.

        first child of the shadow root is guaranteed to be an element.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::didRecalcStyle): Added. Calls the new
        scheduleUpdateForAfterStyleResolution function.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::didAttachRenderers): Moved all the logic from this
        function into scheduleUpdateForAfterStyleResolution. Also added a call through to the base
        class; cleaner even though it's just an assertion.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::scheduleUpdateForAfterStyleResolution): Added.
        Schedules a call to updateAfterStyleResolution when needed.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::updateAfterStyleResolution): Added.
        Combines updateWidgetIfNecessary and startLoadingImage, and also deals with the new
        m_needsImageReload boolean in cases where no actual loading is done.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::removedFrom): Added. Do not delay the load event of
        document once this element is removed, clears m_needsImageReload.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::didMoveToNewDocument): Removed null check on oldDocument,
        since m_needsDocumentActivationCallbacks can't be true if the old document was null.
        (WebCore::is100Percent): Added helper to make function below more readable.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::subframeLoaderWillCreatePlugIn): Restructured the code a
        bit. The part that attracted my attention was the local variable of type RenderBox, which
        was named renderEmbeddedObject. Turns out the caller guarantees to only call this if there
        is a renderer of type RenderEmbeddedObject, so depend on that.
        (WebCore::HTMLPlugInImageElement::setNeedsImageReload): Added. When called with true, sets
        the flag and triggers a style recalculation, and lets updateAfterStyleResolution do the rest.
        When called with false, reverses the effects and stops delaying the load event.

        * html/HTMLPlugInImageElement.h: Trimmed includes a bit. Made more members private.
        Marked more function members final. Made a protected imageLoader function so that
        m_imageLoader can be private. Added new protected function updateImageLoaderWithNewURLSoon,
        as well as other new private functions. Made m_imageLoader be std::unique_ptr instead of
        OwnPtr, and added m_needsImageReload.

        * style/StyleResolveTree.cpp:
        (WebCore::Style::needsPseudoElement): Fixed spelling error in the name of this function.

        of as a special case. It should not work for multiple documents across multiple pages instead of
        only the outermost one.
        (WebCore::Style::PostResolutionCallbackDisabler::PostResolutionCallbackDisabler): Added.
        Calls suspendMemoryCacheClientCalls, but a FIXME tries to point out why that isn't so great.

        toThis() on a JSWorkerGlobalScope should return a JSProxy and not undefined
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130554

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Fixed toThis() on WorkerGlobalScope to return a JSProxy instead of the JSGlobalObject.
        Added cast from JSProxy->target() if the jsCast<>() to the native object fails
        in toJSDedicatedWorkerGlobalScope() and toJSSharedWorkerGlobalScope().
        The original cast is needed for access to the local side of the worker, while the JSProxy
        cast is used on the remote side of a worker.

        Remove the call to flushCompositingStateForThisFrame() here. We should
        have always flushed before painting via other mechanisms in WebKit2 and WebKit2.
        Flushing during painting is actually harmful, since we could be inside
        a CA commit already, and creating or destroying layers via flushing is bad.

        Pseudo type cleanup part 2: split pseudo elements parsing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130370

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        With this patch, pseudo elements are handled separately. The only thing left in
        the old path is compatibility pseudo elements and pseudo classes.

        The list of special pseudo elements is now separated and is stored in SelectorPseudoElementTypeMap.in.
        The script makeSelectorPseudoElementsMap.py takes that list to make the pseudo elements hash table.

        The other pseudo elements are the prefixed ones, they are filtered in CSSSelector::parsePseudoElementType().

        All the non-compatibility selectors are removed from SelectorPseudoTypeMap.in. CSSParserSelector::setPseudoTypeValue()
        is updated accordingly. The next step will be to clean that part.

        Optimize FEGaussian blur
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50881

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Currently boxBlur() will calculate the filter for each channel in
        a loop and also uses Uint8ClampedArray::set() to write the
        resulting pixels into destination array.

        Using Uint8ClampedArray::set() requires lots of unnecessary type
        conversions, not to mention other function calls. This patch
        updates the original written by Simon Fraser to apply cleanly to current
        trunk.

        It also implements code to handle EdgeModes and finally avoids use
        of ::set() in the newly added boxBlurAlphaOnly()
        function. Assignment of calculated pixel values rely on pointers.

        No new tests, no change on behavior.

        When the marker was placed for multi-column list items, it was being inserted
        into the list item itself. Even though the add code in RenderBlock did the right
        thing and put the marker inside the multi-column flow thread, the list item code
        passed in a beforeChild that was computed using the incorrect parent. This resulted
        in the flow thread being used both as the parent of the marker and the sibling of
        the marker.
        
        The fix is to add some code to RenderListItem to make sure it uses the multi-column
        flow thread if it exists both as the parent of the marker and as the basis for the
        computation of the sibling that the marker should be placed in front of.

        Subpixel rendering: RenderBox is positioned off by one when non-compositing transform is present.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130430

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        div {
            position: absolute;
             top: 10.25px;
             left: 10.25px;
         }

         The <div> with (10.25px, 10.25px) is painted to (10.5px, 10.5px) after device pixel snapping on 2x display.
         Moving <div> to its own RenderLayer should not change the painting position.

         div {
             position: absolute;
             top: 10.25px;
             left: 10.25px;
             -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);
         }

        When we paint the RenderLayer's content, the graphics context is translated by the rounded value of
        renderer's offset from parent.

            (10.25px,10.25px) -> rounded to (10.5px,10.5px).

        When the translate moves the graphics context's origin over the renderer's top-left position,
        the renderer's relative top-left coordinates end up being negative.

            Graphics context translated by (10.5px,10.5px) -> pushes renderer's relative top-left coords to (-0.25px,-0.25px)

        When we round (pixel snap) these negative coordinates, half-way values get translated to the wrong direction.

        (relative coords (-0.25px,-0.25px) -> pixel snapped to (-0.5px,-0.5px) -> final absolute(painting) coords (10px,10px))

        This patch changes the rounding to flooring to ensure that the relative top-left position never gets negative as the result
        of subpixel shifting.

        the size of the shape-outside element's margin-box, since the shape-outside's
        boundary is clipped to the margin-box. The radius is just sqrt(2) * the margin-box's
        largest dimension.

        Also cleaned up up a few poorly named parameters.

        Implement contentInset for Mac WebKit2
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130273

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch adds support for topContentInset(). If a page has a topContentInset(), 
        the root layer’s position is adjusted to account for the inset. It is assumed that 
        the area accounted for by the inset is visible but obscured, so scrollbars need to 
        be moved so that they only cover the non-obscured area, and most parts of WebCore 
        that wonder about visibleContentSize only care about the unobscured area, so this 
        patch makes that visibleContentRect return the unobscuredRect. Finally since this 
        is achieved by moving a layer’s position, the topContentInset() also needs to be 
        factored into various functions that are used to convert between coordinate 
        spaces. 

        Return Page::topContentInset() if this is the main frame.

        unobscuredContentRect() used to unconditionally return visibleContentRect() on 
        non-iOS platforms. Now that it is possible for some technically visible content to 
        be obscured, this code needed to be re-worked a bit to make some more sense. 
        visibleContentRect() now represents that visible content that is completely 
        unobscured, so it should call into unobscuredContentRect() rather than the other 
        way around.
        * platform/ScrollView.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScrollView::unobscuredContentRect):

        unscaledTotalVisibleContentSize() includes the size of all content that might be 
        visible. Some of this content might be obscured.
        (WebCore::ScrollView::unscaledTotalVisibleContentSize):

        Most of the time, we only care about the content that is FULLY visible. That is 
        what you get from unscaledUnobscuredVisibleContentSize().

        A completed fill-forwards animation should not disable overlap testing

        Previously, if -webkit-transform was being keyframe-animated, and the
        animation had fill-forwards, then we would continue to think that the
        animation is running and turn off compositing overlap testing. This
        caused some sites to keep too much backing store around.
        
        Fix by having isRunning{Accelerated}AnimationOnRenderer take some flags
        so that more specific questions about the running state can be asked.
        For layer creation, keep using the same criteria as before (for now)
        which includes paused and fill-forwards animations. For overlap testing,
        don't include the fill-forwards test.

        [CSS Blending] Blending operation is not isolated when setting z-index on parent from javascript

        Reimplement the logic behind isolating blend modes. The blending operation should be limited to the

        Reviewed by Andrei Bucur.

        When propagating the layout overflow from the flowed element up to the flow thread itself,
        the region's logical bottom padding and the element's logical bottom margin must be taken into consideration.
        However, if the flowed element has overflow, the overflow will be painted over the region's padding
        and the element's margin, in order to be compatible with the non-regions case.

        [CSSRegions] Compute region ranges for children of inline blocks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130392

        Reviewed by Andrei Bucur.

        Extend the region ranges computation for children of inline blocks.
        When we cannot retrieve the region range for a box using cached information,
        either from region range map or from the region cached on the RootInlineBox,
        try to find the top most unsplittable box up to the flow thread boundary.
        If we find such unsplittable box and the box has a region range, then return
        this range.

        Before this patch, method getRegionRangeForBox did not return true/false
        if it was able to retrieve the range and the caller checked the returned
        region values. I modified the method to return true if we were able to compute
        the range.

        [CSS Regions] Strange layout for content with region breaks
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121318

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie.

        When break-inside: avoid is used on an element, the implementation tries to
        force it inside a single fragmentation container even though the descendants
        of the element specify forced breaks. This leads to unexpected results and
        unstable layout.

        The change extends the definition of unsplittable elements for flow threads
        using the same conditions found inside RenderBlockFlow::adjustForUnsplittableChild.
        This change forces elements that require break avoidance to have a single region
        in the region range. As a result, forced breaks have no effect inside them.

        It should be noted this may not the behavior defined by the CSS3 Fragmentation spec.
        From my understanding of the text, forced breaks override any avoidance specified
        by ancestor elements. However, implementing this is a larger change that will require
        a fundamental new approach in handling break avoidance. This patch just brings
        consistency to the API.

        AX: Not able to use arrow keys to read text with VoiceOver before selection is set someplace (anyplace).

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        If initial selection isn't set when we handle selection movement for accessibility, we need to set it. If we don't, using arrow
        keys to read text with VoiceOver doesn't work as expected. Things will only start working after the user holds shift and arrows
        around to select any arbitrary thing to force selection to get set. This logic handles that special case more gracefully.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Following <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/163560>, SVG inline elements may be treated as block-
        level elements depending on their CSS styles (e.g. display: block). But such elements should always
        be treated as inline-level elements.

        Partially revert <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/164368> as it addressed a similar issue for
        <tspan> and <tref>. Instead we should implement RenderSVGInline::updateFromStyle() to ensure that
        RenderSVGInline and any derived classes (e.g. RenderSVGTSpan) are always treated as inline elements
        regardless of their CSS style because the SVG text layout code depends on this assumption as part
        of a performance optimization. We may want to revaluate the benefits of this optimization with respect
        to code clarity and ensuring the code is less error prone.

        Mutating rules returned by getMatchedCSSRules can result in crash
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130209

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.
        
        The non-standard getMatchedCSSRules API returns CSSStyleRule objects that don't
        have parent stylesheet pointer (as we don't know which sheet the rule originated from).
        Mutating the rule via such wrapper can lead to crashes later as we fail to invalidate
        the underlying stylesheet.
        
        Fix by disallowing mutation of style rules that don't have parent sheet pointer. CSSStyleRule
        has two mutable properties selectorText and style. The latter gives back CSSStyleDeclaration.
        This patch disallows mutations in both cases for CSSStyleRules that don't have parent stylesheet
        pointer.
        
        While it is technically possible to have CSSRules that are legitimately disconnected
        from stylesheet (by removing rule from sheet while holding a reference to it) it never
        makes sense to mutate such rule as there is no way to do anything with it afterwards.

        HTMLInputElement::defaultEventHandler() shouldn't force style updates.

        Move the updateStyleIfNeeded() call down to TextFieldInputType instead
        of doing it for every HTMLInputEvent.

        There might be a better way to do this; we only want to know about this

        Don't supplement the Page with an UserMediaController object if that Page was

        Supplementable::provideSupplement() that ensures no supplement with the same key

        [CSSRegions]Do not compute region range for a box unless the parent has one

        If the containing block does not have a region range computed, do not attempt to compute
        a region range for a child. In such cases, the range computation for a child can lead to

        CSSValueList should assert that no null values are added to it.
        <https://webkit.org/b/130315>

        Add assertions in CSSValueList's append() and prepend() that we are
        not adding a null value. This caught a single place in CSSParser
        that was appending an alread-released RefPtr to a CSSValueList.
        That list was eventually discarded anyway (due to "foundClip" now
        being true), so the fix is simply to remove the adding.

        Eventually we should use Ref and PassRef all over for CSSValueList,
        this is just a first step on the way.

        Optimize hasTagName when called on an HTMLElement

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Added new hasTagName functions that have the efficiency of hasLocalName.
        but are safe.

        Now we can always use hasTagName, and we'll get a compile time error if
        we try to use an SVG tag name with an HTML element. All call sites that
        use the more specific tag name types are more efficient, and call sites
        that have a specific pointer type will get even more efficient checking
        that is exactly what we used to get by calling hasLocalName.

        * accessibility/AccessibilityObject.cpp:

        since Node::hasTagName no longer works on a general QualifiedName.
        * accessibility/AccessibilityRenderObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::AccessibilityRenderObject::isDescendantOfElementType): Use
        more specific type, RenderElement, so we can call hasTagName on Element

        of 0. Call toHTMLElement and toSVGElement in code that checks hasTagName
        since it's already checking isHTMLElement and isSVGElement.

        overloads of hasTagName for all the specific qualified name types. It's
        more efficient to use the Node versions of these functions rather than
        using QualifiedName::matches to do the check. Removed the hasTagName and
        hasLocalName functions from the Node class; the only convenience functions
        needed in Node are the specific checks for tags from HTML, MathML, and SVG,
        not the general purpose ones.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Rounded rectangle's radius needs adjustment after its containing rect gets pixel snapped.
        Keeping the old radius value could make rounded rectangle non-renderable, because the
        originally calculated radius length does not fit the snapped rectangle anymore.

        Other implementations prefer Path2D over Path. Furthermore, currentPath is not the right
        way to apply a Path2D object to a context. Main argument is that currentPath creates a copy

        In anticipation of guidance to be added to the EME Spec <https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24771>,
        extend the lifetime of MediaKeySession by making the session an ActiveDOMObject, and returning true to

        The NSURLCache lives in the networking process and should be cleared
        on that end. Furthermore, this code doesn't really do what we thought
        it was doing; it merely sets and and resets the limits. No truncation
        ever occurred. The intended functionality was implemented in r165342.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130124

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The code uses std::lower_bound() to get the first grid line
        position before a given resolved position in a Vector. That
        function returns an iterator pointing to the first value not
        "strictly less" than the given one. Consequently, the returned
        position might be actually located after the resolved final
        position. In those cases we need to select the previous position
        in the Vector (which is guaranted to be "< resolved position" due
        to how std::lower_bound() works).

        For example, if we have vector=[2,5,8] as grid positions, and we
        need the first position before 7, std::lower_bound(vector, 7) will
        point to 8 (first value not < 7). It's obvious that we should
        select 5 instead. Should the pointed value be equal, then we
        should do nothing, because the indexes mean tracks, so the item
        will be placed in just one cell of the grid.

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        This prepares the MathML stretchy code for future support for the MATH
        table. In particular, this uses the glyph index for measuring and
        drawing instead of Unicode code point since the MATH table uses glyph
        indices. Also, this merges the preferred width and stretchy character
        selection into one common path since they will also have to share the
        size variants measuring/selection. Finally, we expose a drawGlyphs()
        method so that we can draw a glyph by index.

        Thus this patch removes one of them, and manages vibration states by enumeration.

        Also, this patch implement the missing part of the algorithm,

        Add support for the paint-order property from SVG2. The presentation
        attribute/CSS property allows to paint fill, stroke and markers in any order
        the author desires.

        Firefox supports this but behind a runtime flag. It is just activated in
        nightly builds by default.

        Chromium supports it behind a runtime flag as well but is going to ship it
        pretty soon.

        Merged from Blink with changes, (patch by vsevik@chromium.org):
        http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=revision&revision=152712

        Using an XMLHttpRequest to download resources had a few issues. Being an
        Active DOM Object the load could be paused. Without an extra retain,
        when the load was cancelled (e.g. a page reload) the XHR would get
        destructed and could cause a crash if the list of active DOM objects
        was actively being iterated.

        Switch to a DocumentThreadableLoader to manage the load ourselves.
        This still uses the Memory cache, but we have a little more control.

        Optimize hasTagName when called on an HTMLElement
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130090

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Added new hasTagName functions that have the efficiency of hasLocalName.
        but are safe.

        Now we can always use hasTagName, and we'll get a compile time error if
        we try to use an SVG tag name with an HTML element. All call sites that
        use the more specific tag name types are more efficient, and call sites
        that have a specific pointer type will get even more efficient checking
        that is exactly what we used to get by calling hasLocalName.

        * accessibility/AccessibilityObject.cpp:
        (WebCore::AccessibilityObject::hasTagName): Cast explicitly to Element
        since Node::hasTagName no longer works on a general QualifiedName.

        (WebCore::AccessibilityRenderObject::isDescendantOfElementType): Use
        more specific type, RenderElement, so we can call hasTagName on Element
        instead of Node; eliminates an unnecessary branch.

        (WebCore::DocumentStyleSheetCollection::collectActiveStyleSheets): Use
        new for loop and full words for variable names. Also use nullptr instead
        of 0. Call toHTMLElement and toSVGElement in code that checks hasTagName
        since it's already checking isHTMLElement and isSVGElement.

        * dom/Element.h: Removed the overload of hasLocalName that takes a
        QualifiedName and ignores the non-local-name parts of it. Callers should
        use hasTagName instead, now that it's optimized appropriately. Added
        overloads of hasTagName for all the specific qualified name types. It's
        more efficient to use the Node versions of these functions rather than
        using QualifiedName::matches to do the check. Removed the hasTagName and
        hasLocalName functions from the Node class; the only convenience functions
        needed in Node are the specific checks for tags from HTML, MathML, and SVG,
        not the general purpose ones.

        * dom/Node.h: Removed hasLocalName and replaced the single hasTagName
        that takes a QualifiedName with three faster ones that take HTML, MathML,
        and SVG qualified names instead. Also updated to use nullptr instead of 0.

        This variable was the "parent" node where the style was being inherited from, not the actual parent.

        Subpixel rendering: Nested layers with subpixel accumulation paint to wrong position.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130153

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Subpixels (fractional device pixels here) can accumulate through nested layers. Subpixels
        need to be propagated through the layer tree so that painting coordinates match layout coordinates.
        
        Compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> floored painting position (0, 0)
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2), 
        but the actual painting offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of parent flooring.
        
        Non-compositing case: (absolute positioning, 2x display)
        parent layer pos(0.3, 0.3) -> GraphicsContext is translated to (0, 0).
        child layer pos(10.2, 10.2) -> layout offset from parent (10.2, 10.2)
        but the GraphicsContext's offset is (10.5, 10.5) as the result of the parent's translate.   

        In both cases, without the subpixel adjustment, we'd paint the current layer at (10.0, 10.0)
        after flooring, while its painting position is actually (10.5, 10.5).
        Subpixels do accumulate through nested layers.

        Before this patch, every call to RenderBox::scrolledContentOffset was guarded by the
        hasOverflowClip check, because the scrolledContentOffset method would ASSERT(hasOverflowClip()).
        This was simplified by moving the hasOverflowClip check inside the scrolledContentOffset method
        and returning (0, 0) for elements that do not clip the overflow.

        No new tests needed, just a refactor.

        Web Replay: add infrastructure for memoizing nondeterministic DOM APIs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129445

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add two pieces of infrastructure to support memoization of selected DOM APIs.

        The first piece is MemoizedDOMResult, a templated replay input class that knows
        how to serialize a DOM API's return value, ctype, and exception code.

        The second piece is the addition of a new IDL attribute called `Nondeterministic`.
        When placed on a DOM function or attribute, the code generator will emit code
        to save the DOM API's return value or use a memoized return value instead,
        depending on the current replay state. This new emitted code path is behind
        a feature flag.

        No new tests, as no new inputs are addressed by this change. Per-DOM API replay
        regression tests will be added when those APIs are marked as nondeterministic.

        When page settings change, inspector instrumentation should only fire if
        the scriptsEnabled setting actually changes from the previous setting. But
        due to an unnecessary PLATFORM(IOS) guard, the inspector was being notified
        on every settings update even if nothing changed.

        Improve renderer classes for MathML Token elements.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124838

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        This patch continues the refactoring of token elements that has been
        started in bug 44208. The <mo> element now derives from the
        RenderMathMLToken class, which was already used for the <mi> element.
        The behavior of anonymous <mo> elements created by the <mfenced> element
        is now more consistent with the one of "standard" <mo> elements and the
        spacing around them is now handled in RenderMathMLOperator. This is a
        first step towards fixing bugs 115787 and 118843. The only visible
        rendering change is how <mfenced> open/close attributes handle
        whitespace and multiple characters and some tests are added for that.
        Other features are already covered by other tests. Finally, this also
        removes some code from AccessibilityRenderObject that was used to
        workaround issues with <mo> elements.

        Start splitting CSS Selectors's pseudo types
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130003

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        CSS Selectors pseudo types come in 3 flavors: page, pseudo class, pseudo elements.

        The three types are mixed together in a single enum list named PseudoType. Only some combinations
        of match type + pseudo type are valid, but this is implicitly defined from the code.

        This patch is the beginning of a refactoring to add more clear boundaries between
        valid and invalid combinations.

        First, the handling of page pseudo types is completely split from the other values.
        The parser use a different method for handling the value CSSParserSelector::parsePagePseudoSelector().

        PagePseudo types no longer store their string in the CSSSelector either to reduce the redundancy
        with m_pseudoType.
        When we need to generate the string for those CSSSelector, we recreate the string as needed in
        CSSSelector::selectorText().

        The remaining two types are not yet split in this patch but this introduce the preliminary clean up
        toward that goal.
        The list of parsed pseudo types is now generated at compile time from the source in SelectorPseudoTypeMap.in.

        * DerivedSources.make:
        The mapping of strings to pseudo types is generated from SelectorPseudoTypeMap.in

        iOS has a special FrameLoader::forceLayoutWithoutRecalculatingStyle()
        function that is called instead of FrameView::forceLayout(). This was unimplemented
        for the WK2 FrameLoaderClient, so no layout was forced, with the result
        that the contentSize was never updated and scrolling was broken.
        
        Fix by renaming the client function to forceLayoutOnRestoreFromPageCache()
        and having it return a bool to say whether the default forceLayout()
        should be done. WK1 can then continue to have its custom behavior,
        and Wk2 will simply do a forceLayout().

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that both the simple and non-simple cases paint to the same position.
        Simple compositing container layer codepath needs to take the fractional device pixel offset
        into account when painting. Without the fractional value, the final paint rounding could push the
        paint offset to a different position.
        retina example:
        compositing top-left: 0px 0px.
        fractional offset: 0.3px 0.3px
        painting coords without offseting: 0px 0px

        In case of traversal failure, their is no point in recovering from the indirect adjancent entry point and
        we should clear entry point from the stack (which is the purpose of the tail).

        The adjancent tail was missing the part for clearing the stack in one case.

        The case with adjancent backtracking inside descendant backtracing was doing everything right. This patch
        generalize this code and the correct tail is fully generated by generateAdjacentBacktrackingTail().

        After fixing the leak in r165252, I was surprised to find that it didn't

        Since we are just faking the memory pressure on bots, we have to let
        system malloc in on the fun, so we can get representative numbers.

        Invalid cast in WebCore::RenderLayer::FilterInfo::updateReferenceFilterClients()

        <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121887>
        <rdar://problem/15073043>

        Clang appears to be optimizing out a branch in RenderObject::node()
        when compiling RenderLayer::FilterInfo::updateReferenceFilterClients().
        We'll work around this by factoring out the code in question into a
        separate member function marked NEVER_INLINE.

        No test possible due to <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129757>.

        Fixes an issue where an assertion failure would occur when visiting a web site whose on-disk
        app cache doesn't contain a manifest resource.

        For some reason an app cache for a web site may be partially written to disk. In particular, the
        app cache may only contain a CacheGroups entry. That is, the manifest resource and origin records
        may not be persisted to disk. From looking over the code, we're unclear how such a situation can occur
        and hence have been unable to create such an app cache. We were able to reproduce this issue using
        an app cache database file that was provided by a person that was affected by this issue.

        No test included because it's not straightforward to write a test for this change.

        (WebCore::ApplicationCacheGroup::checkIfLoadIsComplete): Assert that m_cacheBeingUpdated->manifestResource()

        on failure.

            The root cause is CompositeEditCommand::moveParagraphWithClones() passing

        outlineBoundsForRepaint() is expected to return the outline repaint rect. Using enclosingIntRect()
        to calculate the outline boundaries breaks repaint logic in RenderElement::repaintAfterLayoutIfNeeded().
        Since enclosingIntRect() can return bigger rect than repaint rect, the old/new bounds' dimensions could end up

        Before this patch, invalidateNodeListAndCollectionCachesInAncestors invalidated node lists and HTML

        caches.

        Each user of CollectionIndexCache now implements willValidateIndexCache member function that gets
        called when CollectionIndexCache caches any state and necessitates the registration with document.

        This regression started happening after we adopted the setPresentationValue 
        ScrollbarPainter API which allows us to update the position of the scrollbar knob 
        from our secondary scrolling thread. The bug occurs when the scrollbar grows while 
        it still thinks it is in presentation-value mode. Whenever the scrollbar grows, it 
        should be in non-presentation value mode.

        If the wheel event has ended or been cancelled, we can switch out of presentation 
        value mode.

        mandated by the spec. Otherwise we would end up calculating a
        percentage of -1, the value we use to represent infinite.

        On YouTube embeds, while the video is loading it is placed into the DOM with a 0x0 size.
        This causes the start playback button to be visible in the upper-left corner of the embed
        area. The button wasn't visible previously (in plugin mode) because the plugin clipped its
        drawing to its bounds, and so the <video> shadow should do the same.

        This patch moves the logic about how far to draw the second underline (when text-decoration-style: double
        is specified) from InlineTextBox to GraphicsContext, because GraphicsContext is the authoritative source
        about how thick underlines should be. The space between the two underlines is set to the thickness of
        each of the underlines.

        This patch also deletes some unused code in InlineTextBox that was never getting triggered, in addition
        to unifying drawLineForText with drawLinesForText. This didn't have any performance impact in my testing.

        [CSS Shapes] Serialize circle positions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129404

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        Circle positions should always be present when serialized, and should
        only have the 2 or 4-valued form. Keywords are converted to percentages
        and simplified where possible. This patch adds some additional processing
        that converts the parsed position into the serialized format, before
        converting it to text. See http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-shapes/#basic-shape-serialization.

        [CSS Regions] Overset computation is incorrect in some cases
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129032

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie.

        This patch reworks the way overset is computed for regions and named flows.

        1. Regions overflow no longer trigger an overset changed event. This is because
        the overflow of a box is contained within the region range of the box. The content
        edge should be considered the logical bottom position of the content inside the
        flow thread.

        2. The regions events logic was moved from RenderFlowThread to RenderNamedFlowThread
        and from RenderRegion to RenderNamedFlowFragment (including the regionOverset property).

        3. The overset value of the named flow is no longer stored in the named flow. It is
        extracted from the overset of the last region in the chain.

        4. The regions overset is not computed every time the flow thread is laid out which
        should improve performance for flows with many regions. With the patch, each region
        computes the overset value during its layout when the flow thread is in the overflow
        or the final layout phase.

        5. The overset changed event is dispatched only at the end of the layout of the named flows,
        after all the region overset changes have been considered. This means that the overset
        event can't be dispatched in the middle of the auto-height processing algorithm that
        requires multiple layout passes for the flow threads.

        However, the region layout update event dispatch timing was not changed, it is dispatched
        every time the flow thread has a layout. This preserves the current behavior of the event.

        Tests: The old tests were modified to take into account the change.

        Web Replay: upstream input storage, capture/replay machinery, and inspector domain

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher, Joseph Pecoraro, and Andreas Kling.

        No new tests yet, as they rely on infrastructure tracked in https://webkit.org/b/129190.

        Replayable executions are organized into ReplaySessions, which can
        contain several ReplaySessionSegments that divide overall execution
        at main frame navigation boundaries. NondeterministicInput subclasses
        are stored in SegmentedInputStorage according to the input's InputQueue.

        Capture and playback are controlled at the page granularity by the Page's
        ReplayController. The controller knows how to create new segments, replay to
        arbitrary positions in the ReplaySession, and track the active InputCursor.

        The capturing and replaying input cursor subclasses encapsulate state for
        storing new inputs and loading/dispatching saved inputs, respectively.

        The ReplayAgent and associated inspector protocol domain is the friendly
        public API for programmatically capturing and replaying sessions.

        [iOS][WK2] Pages using tiled compositing layers allocate too many tiles on zoom
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129471

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        A few issues with TileController were causing sublayers of the root layers
        to tile incorrect surfaces on zoom.

        First, the exposedRect API was not updating the sublayers. The layers go correctly
        into tiling mode, but the tiles cover the full document instead of the visible area.

        The other major issue was the margins being applied to the coverage size in document
        coordinates. Since each margin is 512px, the total coverage size after zoom was
        gigantic.

        To solve this, this patch switch from the exposedRect API to the generic concept
        of VisibleExtentContentRect introduced for iOS WebKit1.

        a factor of 1.5.
        ViewUpdateDispatcher has all the information to compute a great tile coverage, I will need
        a follow up patch to fix that.

        Split UserActivity, simplify PageThrottler
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129551

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The class UserActivity currently implements two things – a hysteresis mechanism, and
        an abstraction of NSActivity controlled by that mechanism. PageThrottler implements
        its own hysteresis mechanism, which directly controls DOM timer throttling and also
        controls a couple of UserActivities, giving a total of 3 separate hysteresis mechanisms,
        layered two deep.

        Split UserActivity into three, with HysteresisActivity implementing an abstract hysteresis
        mechanism, UserActivity::Impl controlling the NSActivity, and then UserActivity combining
        these two back together. The interface to UserActivity is unchanged.

        Remove PageThrottler's bespoke hysteresis, replacing it with a use of HysteresisActivity.
        Replace the two UserActivities with a single UserActivity::Impl, so there are no longer

        http://crbug.com/276111

            This patch fixes a crash in SMIL animations when keySplines are not
            specified. The SMIL spec is clear on this:
            http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/#AnimFuncCalcMode
            "If there are any errors in the keyTimes specification (bad values,
            too many or too few values), the animation will have no effect."

            This patch simply checks that keyTimes is not empty. Previously,
            splinesCount was set to be m_keySplines.size() + 1 in
            SVGAnimationElement.cpp; this patch changes splinesCount to be equal
            to m_keySplines.size() to make the logic easier to follow and to
            match other checks in SVGAnimationElement::startedActiveInterval.

        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::SelectorCodeGenerator::SelectorCodeGenerator):
        Attribute Set does not do value matching, the case sensitive value matching is irrelevant
        The problem is that flag is also used by minimumRegisterRequirements()

        Set the flag to case sensitive to avoid reserving one extra register.

        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::minimumRegisterRequirements):
        Use a new backtrackingFlag to know if there is a descendant tail, thus a backtracking register
        reserved.
        This is better than using the backtracking action because the backtracking chain could be
        an adjacent chain inside a descendant chain.

        The flags are designed for that, just set one for minimumRegisterRequirements().

        The 2 extra registers for the attribute count and address become limited to all attributes
        except the last one. We don't keep a copy for the last matching, those registers were not needed.

        Also fixed the invalid descriptor handling, which wasn't aligned with the spec, and therefore was not as forward compatible as it should be.

        My previous fix for this problem was incomplete. This continuation of that fix addresses
        the flaw in the original and adds additional lifetime checking so problems can be seen in
        debug builds without a memory debugger.

        * rendering/InlineBox.cpp:

        (WebCore::InlineBox::~InlineBox): Refactored body into a new function named
        invalidateParentChildList. Added code to update the deletion sentinel to record
        that this object is deleted.
        (WebCore::InlineBox::setHasBadParent): Moved here from header since this debug-only
        feature does not need to be inlined. Added a call to assertNotDeleted.
        (WebCore::InlineBox::invalidateParentChildList): Added. Refactored from the destructor,
        this is used by RenderTextLineBoxes.

        * rendering/InlineBox.h: Added the deletion sentinel, and called it in the parent
        function. Also changed the expansion/setExpansion functions to use the type name "int",
        since we don't use the type name "signed" in the WebKit coding style.

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::~InlineFlowBox): Call setHasBadChildList rather than doing the
        setHasBadParent work on children directly, to avoid code duplication.
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::setHasBadChildList): Moved here from header. Added code to set
        "has bad parent" on all children, something we previously did only on destruction. Also
        added assertNotDeleted.
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::checkConsistency): Added call to assertNotDeleted. Also tweaked
        code style and variable names a little bit.

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.h: Moved setHasBadChildList out of the header when it's on.

        The idea of this patch is to perform querySelector on a subtree

        "#foobar div a", we start by looking for the element with ID foobar in the TreeScope
        cache, and start matching the children from there.

        The idea comes from Rune for

        Filters should test for area instead of single dimension
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123716

        Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

        A filtered SVG element with a sigle dimension bigger than 5000
        (counting the margin/border) will fail to render. So an element
        with 4000x4000 will render fine, while another with 5000x10
        won't. This patch instead tests against the total element area,
        which fixes such cases.

        It also fixes some layer violations where FilterEffectRenderer and
        RenderSVGResourceFilter were directly accessing the maximum filter
        size in FilterEffect. Since before a somewhat bigger filter would
        be aborted, it required to change the maximum kernel size
        for blur filter (some filters are slower to run than others for
        bigger SVGs).

        [CSS Grid Layout] Fix positioning grid items using named grid lines/areas
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129372

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Our code was assuming that a <custom-ident> in
        -webkit-grid-{column|row}-{start|end} and
        -webkit-grid-{column|row} was always a grid area name. That's
        wrong because the <custom-ident> could be also a explicitly named
        grid line or the an implicitly named grid line created by a grid
        area definition.

        The style resolution code was not correct either. This patch fixes
        it so it now matches the spec, which means that:
        - first we try to match any existing grid area.
        - then if there is a named grid line with the name
        <custom-ident>-{start|end} for -webkit-grid-{column|row}-{start|end}
        defined before the grid area then we use it instead of the grid
        area.
        - otherwise if there is a named grid line we resolve to the first such line.
        - otherwise we treat it as 'auto'.

        Fixing this uncovered a bug in GridPosition, we were not using the
        name of the stored grid area to check if two GridPositions were
        the same.

        In the css3-text spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#bidi-linebox):

        The start and end edges of a line box are determined by the inline
        base direction of the line box. In most cases, this is given by
        its containing block's computed ‘direction’. However if its
        containing block has ‘unicode-bidi: plaintext’, the inline base
        direction the line box must be determined by the base direction of
        the bidi paragraph to which it belongs: that is, the bidi
        paragraph for which the line box holds content.

        This patch just implements the behavior described above modifying

        regionAtBlockOffset method is meant to be used after the flow thread validated
        its region chain, otherwise we cannot rely on regionAtBlockOffset to determine correctly
        the target region based on the offset in flow thread coordinates.

        When the video element is collected in a named flow and displayed in a region, we ensure
        that the region's decorations are taken into account to properly position the video.
        However, we have to do that only if the named flow regions are validated.

        I changed the method cachedRegionForCompositedLayer to check only the "cached" region
        for a layer and not update the layer to region mappings before returning the region.
        Because method cachedRegionForCompositedLayer does not update the region - layer mappings,

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129249

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The three call sites of SelectorQueryCache were doing the exact same thing.
        That code is mvoed to a new function Document::selectorQueryForString().

        Also use String instead of AtomicString for querySelector() and querySelectorAll().
        This prevent the call sites from creating AtomicString just for the time of the call.
        This causes a tiny slow down on microbenchmarks that continuously query the same string
        but has no negative impact on realistic/good test cases (and the bindings are simplified).

        JSC ignores the extra memory cost of HTMLCollection after a major GC
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129450

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Report the extra memory cost of HTMLCollection to JSC.

        Unfortunately, the existing mechanism to report the extra memory cost in toJS is insufficient for
        HTMLCollection since collection caches are populated later when HTMLCollection is accessed. Also,
        the extra memory cost reported by Heap::reportExtraMemoryCost will be thrown away after a major GC.

        To work around this limitation, added a visitor.reportExtraMemoryUsage call inside visitChildren
        for interfaces with a newly added ReportExtraMemoryCost IDL extension flag to report the extra cost.

        Since we may need to generate visitChildren when this flag is set, we can't automatically detect
        and generate calls using C++ template as done in r148648.

        Compile attribute value matching
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129228

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Add support for compiling value matching when matching attributes in Selector.
        This patch only adds exact matching, the other cases will follow.

        There is a little infrastructure changes since FunctionCall now needs to support
        calls taking 2 arguments. The fun begins when the arguments are not in the right
        registers and need to be moved to the right place. Otherwise the code is straightforward.

        In SelectorCompiler, it is necessary to handle two different cases of matching: case sensitive
        and case insensitive. The choice is done in part at compilation time by asking HTMLDocument
        if the name filter can include case insensitive attribute. The other part is done at runtime
        by querying the element for its type and document.

        Here we need to swap two registers, but we cannot allocate a new register (because the context
        of the function call may have taken all the available registers already).

        On x86, the solution is simple, we can swap the two registers without side effects.

        On other platforms, it is a little more complex. If there is any available register, we can just
        use it as a temporary to make the swap.
        If there are no available registers, we know that all the registers are taken. Since swapArguments()
        was called after pushing all the arguments on the stack, we can safely trash the value of any of those.
        We take the first available register that is not a function argument and use it as a temporary.

        (WebCore::FunctionCall::prepareAndCall):
        This is the fun part, we have two registers where the values must go before the function call. The values
        can be in any combination of the allocated registers. The code here needs to move the two values to
        their target register while avoiding conflicts.

        The value of HTMLDocument::isCaseSensitiveAttribute is needed at compilation time to compute the number
        of required registers. As a result, we need to keep it along in the selector fragment.

        (WebCore::SelectorCompiler::SelectorCodeGenerator::generateElementAttributeMatching):
        The matching code is moved in a local scope. This is done to recover the register of qualifiedNameImpl
        before doing any value matching. That register can then be used to store the expected value when matching
        an attribute value.
        It is unfortunate there is so much register pressure in this part.

        Value matching is done outside the loop. The idea is to keep the loop really small since in the vast majority
        of cases, name matching fails.
        If the value matching fails, we jump back into the tight loop.

        This is not ideal in all situation. For example trivial name matching with trivial value matching should
        be done in loop. There is a FIXME to improve those cases later.

        In the case sensitive branch, things are really simple. We have to AtomicStringImpl pointers, if they
        don't match, it is a failure.

        The case sensitive branch start by comparing the pointers in case the values are equal. This is a common
        case and it simplifies the cases for SVG, XHTML, etc.
        If the two values are not equal, we must first find if the context requires case insensitive comparison
        (HTMLElement in HTMLDocument). If the conditions require case insensitive matching, we then fall back
        to a function call.

        text-decoration-skip: ink does not skip over SVG fonts
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128936

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When drawing glyphs in an SVG font, the glyphs are converted to paths and then filled. This patch moves
        the glyph -> path conversion into a helper class, GlyphToPathTranslator, and creates an implementation
        for the SVG drawing code. Once this helper class is created, it can be used to trace paths in order
        to make underlines skip over SVG glyphs. This helper class also has an implementation for non-SVG glyphs,
        which allows for the glyph tracing code to be paramaterized over the implementation of the helper class
        rather than if the FontData itself is SVG or not.

        Indenting an indented image element resulted in an extra indentation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129201

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        The bug was caused by endOfParagraph returning a position at the beginning of a block when the position
        passed into the function was at the beginning of the block. Consider the following DOM:
        <blockquote><img></blockquote>

        When endOfParagraph is called on (blockquote, 0), the condition r->isBR() || isBlock(n) in endOfParagraph
        matches immediately on startNode and it returns (blockquote, 0) again.

        This resulted in moveParagraphWithClones invoked by indentIntoBlockquote to erroneously clone the inner
        blockquote. Worked around this bug in ApplyBlockElementCommand::formatSelection by checking this specific
        condition and moving the position to the end of the block. Unfortunately, a lot of existing code depends
        on the current behavior of endOfParagraph so fixing the function itself was not possible.

        There was another bug in indentIntoBlockquote to incorrectly insert a new blockquote into the existing
        blockquote due to the code introduced in r99594 to avoid inserting before the root editable element.
        Since this happens only if outerBlock is the root editable element, which is nodeToSplitTo or an ancestor
        of nodeToSplitTo, explicitly look for this condition.

        don't wish to observe network reachability at all, add a global opt-out.

        Web Replay: route through UserInputBridge when delivering user inputs to WebCore
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128150

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Add an UserInputBridge instance to each Page. WebKit2 routes a page's user inputs through
        the WebCore page's user input bridge so that the inputs can be selectively captured, filtered,
        and replayed using instrumentation inside the UserInputBridge.

        For now, the routing methods of UserInputBridge have no replay-specific code paths, and just
        put the input delivery code inside WebCore rather than its external clients. Replay-specific
        code paths will be added once https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128782 is fixed. However,
        once complete the code will work as follows:

        - When neither capturing or replaying, behavior is unchanged.

        - When capturing user inputs, each external input is saved into a replay log as it crosses
        the bridge from outside WebCore.

        - When replaying, the bridge closes and user inputs from WebKit2 are not accepted. Instead,
        the saved inputs from the replay log are re-dispatched as if they had crossed the bridge.

        [CSS Grid Layout] handle undefined RemainingSpace in computeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks algorithm
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128372

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        From Blink r165692 by <svillar@igalia.com>

        The spec defines a different code path for the computeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks algorithm
        http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/#function-ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks.

        Basically the track breadth is different when the available size is undefined and thus,
        cannot be taken into account during the computations.
        The available size is undefined whenever the height is auto or the grid element has a
        shrink-to-fit behavior.

        It was also renamed the function to match the specs so the function name starts with
        'compute' instead of 'computed'.

        No new tests, but added new cases to some of them.

        [CSS Regions] Relative positioned elements overflowing the region do not get painted into the next tile
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129254

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The painting of the region's layer should not be aborted so early if the region's fragment shouldn't be painted
        because that would prevent all the layer's children from being painted.

        Another problem this patch addresses is that clipping should also be performed when the clip rect is empty,
        which is what happens when painting in a tile in which the flowed element would normally be painted
        if it wasn't clipped by the region.

        Bug 119043 - Large stretch size error for MathML operators.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119043

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        The MathML code used some arbitrary gOperatorExpansion factor for the
        stretch size and 2/3 1/2 constants for the baseline. This change tries
        to consider height/depth of siblings of the stretchy operator so that
        the stretchy operator now matches its target.

        To eliminate the internal use of -webkit-user-modify, use contenteditable attribute in the inner text elements

        Unfortunately, we still have to manually set UserModify value in RenderTextControl::adjustInnerTextStyle since
        RenderTextControl::styleDidChange creates RenderStyle for its inner text from scratch via createInnerTextStyle.

        I can't handle the case of the cursor appearing above the bottom of
        absolutely positioned divs (of the case of floats inside absolutely
        positioned divs) because you can't know where the bottom of a div
        will end up being rendered (it is affected by things like browser
        window width and text size settings). Therefore, the only case I
        can handle is the case where there is a floating div in the same
        level as the document itself.

        jsDocumentPrototypeFunctionGetElementById should not create an AtomicString for the function argument
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128893

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The declaration of TreeScope::getElementById() was taking an AtomicString as the parameter.
        Because of this, all the call sites manipulating String were creating and keeping alive an AtomicString
        to make the call.

        This had two negative consequences:
        -The call sites were ref-ing the ID's atomic string for no reason.
        -When there is no ID associated with the input string, an atomic string was created for the sole
         purpose of failing the query. Since IDs are stored as AtomicString, if there is not an existing
         AtomicString for the input, there is no reason to query anything.

        'mouseenter' mouse compat event not fired when listeners for touch events
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128534

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The code dispatching mouseenter and mouseleave events was making the assumption that
        only mouse move would cause Document::updateHoverActiveState.

        This is not true in some cases. In the case of this bug, the first touch handler sets
        the hover state. From there, the code handling enter/leave is in an inconsistent state.

        This patch changes the delivery of mouse enter/leave events to be done through the regular
        processing of mouse events. The update is done with the mouseover and mouseout events.

        [CSS Regions] Regions don't paint correctly in new-multicol elements
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120711

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        This patch implements basic support for regions inside multi-column elements.
        Currently, the painting and hit-testing logic of CSS Regions is not aware of
        enclosing multi-column elements. The change is integrated at a layer level by
        making use of the pre-computed layer fragments during the painting and hit-testing
        phases for regions.

        There are limitations such that self painting layers found inside the named flow
        thread layer will not be correctly processed because they don't go through the
        layer fragment collection step. This is not trivial to implement because the enclosing
        pagination layer provided by the multi-column element is not visibile from inside
        the named flow thread layer and they reside in different coordinate systems.

        A side effect of this patch is the fix of regions incorrect clipping in certain
        cases (when both a region and its container clip their overflow, the region's
        content is visible outside the container).

        m_ancestorDisabledState should never be unknown
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129084

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        In order to resolve the bug 129035, a text form control elements needs to synchronously change
        its inner text element's editability by setting or unsetting contenteditable content attribute.
        Before this patch, we could not do this because editability of a text form control dependent on
        its disabled-ness which was only computed lazily via updateAncestorDisabledState().

        This patch makes HTMLFieldSetElement and HTMLFormControlElement update this state synchronously.
        To avoid O(k) DOM traversal, where k is the depth of the tree, in insertedInto and removedFrom of
        HTMLFormControlElement on most pages, a new document-level flag, m_disabledFieldsetElementsCount,
        has been added to indicate whether the document contains any disabled fieldset or not.

        Also renamed the misleadingly named disabledAttributeChanged to disabledStateChanged, and added
        new function of the same name (disabledAttributeChanged) to be used by HTMLFieldSetElement
        for keeping the document-level flag up-to-date upon disabled attribute changes.

        Tests: fast/forms/fieldset/fieldset-disabled-2.html
