        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224262

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The regression was caused by Element::focus not updating the selection when preventScroll is set to true.
        Fixed it by always updating the selection whenever Element::focus is called.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224148

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        This patch migrates from

        struct Value {

            Optional<FloatRect> extent;

            size_t itemSizeInBuffer { 0 };
        };
        Optional<Value> operator*() const

        There are two reasons for this:
        1. Philosophically, if the item is nullopt, then all the stuff in the Value is also meaningless
        2. Part of the iterator's API contract is that if the item is nullopt, you're not allowed to keep
               iterating - doing this will lead to an infinite loop. Promoting the optional makes it more
               likely that this API contract is followed in the future.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        ItemBuffer{Writing,Reading}Client exists within DisplayListItemBuffer.h. The DisplayList item types exist within DisplayListItems.h.

        Previously, the #include path was:
        DisplayListItems.h -> DisplayList.h -> DisplayListItemBuffer.h

        However, this means that DisplayListItemBuffer.h can't see what's inside DisplayListItems.h.

        After this patch, the #include path is:
        DisplayList.h -> DisplayListItemBuffer.h -> DisplayListItems.h

        This is important because ItemBuffer{Writing,Reading}Client have encodeItem() and decodeItem() functions, which will need to know
        about DisplayList item types if we want to migrate away from ItemHandle.

        Reviewed by BJ Burg.

        Previously, implicit `auto` track sizes were only shown if there were some number of explicit track sizes for
        that track direction (rows/columns). To resolve this, `authoredGridTrackSizes` now only returns explicit
        authored track sizes, and buildGridOverlay then infers `auto` for all remaining tracks. This will also help
        resolve bug 224200 by providing a way to distinguish explicit and implicit tracks.

        After discussion, this patch also removes the computed size of tracks from labels, as that information is
        available in the box model diagram for children elements and having that information in these labels further
        cramped often limited space for overlay labels.

        Reviewed by BJ Burg.

        Use the `authoredTrackColumnSizes`/`authoredTrackRowSizes` to determine if the line is an explicit grid line or
        implicit grid line (starting with the patch for bug 224199 those vectors will only contain the explicit lines).
        Only explicit lines should have a negative number for addressing the line, and those numbers should start with
        the last explicit line. Because each track is bounded by two lines, there will always be one more explicit line
        than there is explicit track, including the case where there are no explicit tracks, which will still have a
        single explicit line numbered `-1`.

        Additionally, line numbers are now separated by an em-space to improve legibility, where previously the bullet
        looked like a multiplication symbol between two numbers.

        Assert failure in isCloneInShadowTreeOfSVGUseElement
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224174

        Reviewed by Darin Adler and Antti Koivisto.

        The bug was caused by two related but distinct issues:
        1. An element can have an instance that had been removed from a use element's shadow tree
           but not yet deleted. Because SVGElement clears its correspondingElement in its destructor,
           when addEventListener is called on such an element, it can try to add an event listener
           on this instance which is in the process of getting disposed.
        2. DOM mutation events can be fired on the corresponding element of an instance inside
           a use element’s shadow tree with EventQueueScope in the stack when the event is schedueld
           via Node::dispatchScopedEvent, e.g. because use element's shadow tree was updated during
           a style update at the beginning of document.execComand. Because SVGUseElement::cloneTarget
           constructs the shadow tree by cloning the original tree while it's disconnected from the
           document, Node::dispatchSubtreeModifiedEvent sees isInShadowTree() to be false and happily
           tries to dispach DOMSubtreeModified event using Node::dispatchScopedEvent. This works fine
           when the event is dispatched synchronously since these elements had never been exposed to
           any scripts yet and they are still disconnected so no scripts have had an opportunity to
           attach an event listener. But when EventQueueScope in the stack, Node::dispatchScopedEvent
           will queue up the event and fire it later when those instance elements had been inserted
           into use element's shadow tree.

        This patch addresses (1) by severing correspondingElement relationship as soon as an instance
        is removed from its use element's shadow tree, and (2) by not dispatching a scheduled mutation

        [GStreamer] At EOS, change position to match duration, not the other way around.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224237

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        The criteria used to check if playback has finished is currentTime >=
        duration. Currently MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::didEnd() ensures this
        in an awkward way: by changing the duration so that it matches
        currentTime, rather than the other way around.

        This meant a duration change at the end of playback most of the time,
        with a slightly different duration each time, since currentTime is
        cached periodically.

        This patch reworks that function to work more naturally and less racy:

        First, only if the stream doesn't have a set duration (e.g. live
        stream), we set a duration to currentTime, as defined in the spec.

        Second, at EOS we update currentTime to match duration, rather than
        the other way around.

        This patch doesn't introduce changes in test results.

        <rdar://problem/75975709>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        r274600 introduced the use of system colors for control backgrounds.
        However, the system fill colors are not opaque, leading to poor
        visibility on certain page/element backgrounds.

        To fix, use an opaque variant of the system fill colors, as if they
        were drawn on top of a white background. Note that UIKit does not
        expose these opaque variants, leaving us to make the adjustments
        ourselves.

        * css/CSSValueKeywords.in:

        Replace the system fill color keywords with opaque variants. The old
        colors are fine to remove, since they were only introduced in r274600,
        and have no external clients.

        Reviewed by BJ Burg.

        Grid overlays did not previous honor writing modes and RTL layout direction correctly. The underlying math was
        correct, but the 'origin' of the element's grid, and the direction in which rows and columns increased, was not
        handled correctly. This patch resolves this by taking writing mode and direction into account when calculating
        row/column line positions as well as correctly orienting layout label arrows based on the current writing
        mode/direction.

        Area names have been moved to the center of their respective areas, which both helps to make sure the label is
        within the area for all writing modes/direction/transformation, as well as improved legibility on smaller grids
        where area names were previously behind other labels.

        The same applies also to the applyInheritGridTemplateXXX calls. We're also removing a duplicate call
        to setGridAutoRepeat{Row|Column}sInsertionPoint() that is not needed at all.

        In order to have a single place with all the style properties affecting columns and rows, all the set
        calls were moved to a macro that is used by all the apply{Initial|Inherit}GridTemplate{Columns|Rows}
        methods. This would allow us to prevent eventual out-of-sync issues like this one.

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        When running layout tests without idempotent text autosizing after layout tests with idempotent text autosizing
        enabled, it's possible to get into a state where the text size adjustment timer (which is used to schedule
        idempotent text autosizing style adjustments) is scheduled, but idempotent text autosizing is disabled before
        the timer fires. This causes the assertion in `resetIdempotentTextAutosizingIfNeeded` to fail, leading to a
        debug assertion.

        To prevent this, we simply add a client method to call out to WebPage to stop its idempotent text autosizing
        timer when the idempotent text autosizing WebCore setting changes to disabled.

        This fixes assertions on these four tests, which are normally run after fast/text-autosizing:
        - fast/text/control-characters/visible-control-characters-1.html
        - fast/text/firstline/001.html

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki.

        To run a worker, we were constructing a ScriptSourceCode from the source String and calling
        JSC::evaluate. ScriptSourceCode would construct a JSC::StringSourceProvider, which would
        keep the source String alive for the lifetime of the provider. This is problematic since
        those worker scripts may be big and keeping heap-allocated version of them in memory is
        expensive.

        To address the issue, this patch introduces a new JSC::SourceProvider subclass named
        ScriptBufferSourceProvider, which uses a ScriptBuffer internally. ScriptBuffer has the
        benefit of being able to hold file-mapped data. We only convert the ScriptBuffer to
        a String whenever necessary (When the script contains non-ascii characters and JSC
        requests a StringView to the script). If we do end up converting the ScriptBuffer to
        a String, this String will get cleared on memory pressure. This is similar to what
        CachedScriptSourceProvider / CachedScript do on the main thread.

        In the warm case, where the service worker script is coming from disk, we create
        the ScriptBufferSourceProvider right away from a file-mapped ScriptBuffer, thus
        greatly reducing dirty memory use. In the cold case, we initially construct the
        ScriptBufferSourceProvider using a ScriptBuffer that is not file-mapped. However,
        once the script is saved to disk (via SWScriptStorage), we replace the
        ScriptBufferSourceProvider's ScriptBuffer with the new file-mapped version in
        order to reduce dirty memory use in this case too.

        - Add new ScriptBufferSourceProvider, which is a JSC::SourceProvider subclass that
        uses a ScriptBuffer as backing instead of a String. This allows us to use file-mapped
        memory whenever possible, thus reducing dirty memory use. This provider provides
        similar functionality to CachedScriptSourceProvider / CachedScript but works with
        a ScriptBuffer and can be used off the main thread.
        - We only transform the SharedBuffer into a String when strictly necessary, meaning
          that the ScriptBuffer contains non-ascii characters and JSC is asking for a StringView
          to the script.
        - The class supports clearing the String copy of the script (done on memory pressure)
          and replacing the ScriptBuffer (with a new file-mapped version).

        Fix max-content on tables with percentage cell widths.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221165

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        When `width: max-content` is specified on an element, any percentages
        on content inside the element that are relative to the containing block
        width should be treated as auto.  Percentages on table cells and columns
        in tables using auto table layout are not quite relative to the
        containing block width, but do have a similar influence.  So when
        computing the intrinsic width of a table for the purpose of determining
        the max-content value to use, ignore any percentages specified on table
        cells and columns.

        This change makes us match Firefox and Chrome on the test case.

        [GPU Process] Simplify DisplayList::Iterator part 1: Require encoding/decoding delegates for non-inline display list items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223849

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        Requiring delegates for non-inline display list items has these advantages:
        - DisplayList::Iterator::updateCurrentItem() only has 2 codepaths instead of 3.
        - ItemBuffer::m_itemsToDestroyInAllocatedBuffers can be deleted entirely.
        - The conditional inside ItemBuffer::append() can be simplified from
              !T::isInlineItem && m_writingClient to just !T::isInlineItem, which I think makes the
              function significantly more readable.

        There are a few places where we were using non-inline display list items without a delegate:
        This patch adds two new "null" delegates, and hooks them up to a subclass of DisplayList,
        called InMemoryDisplayList. Clients who want to use in-memory display lists (like the
        DrawGlyphs cache) can just use this class, and retain their calling pattern they were using
        before. Also, this patch adds InMemoryDisplayList without adding any virtual functions to
        DisplayList.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        Remove [Replaceable] extended attribute from `document.all`
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223883

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        [Replaceable] semantics was introduced around 2003 to work around a web-compat issue.
        Since then, `document.all` was revised multiple times and standardized as [[IsHTMLDDA]]
        object without a setter, which was proven to be compatible with the web.

        This patch aligns WebKit with the spec [1], Blink, and Gecko.

        iOS apps are unlikely to accidentally depend on subtleties in `document.all` behavior since
        they were authored long after it became obsolete.

        Old versions of libraries, originally designed for the web, are also unlikely to rely on
        previous behavior, because `document.all` was never replaceable in some popular browsers.

        Introduce ScriptBuffer class to wrap SharedBuffer containing a script

        Reviewed by Yusuke Suzuki and Geoff Garen.

        Introduce ScriptBuffer class to wrap SharedBuffer containing a script. We started using SharedBuffer to represent
        worker scripts instead of String, so that they can hold file mapped data and be shared across processes.
        This patch introduces a new ScriptBuffer to wrap those SharedBuffers. The type makes it clearer what type of
        data we're dealing with. The helper functions used to convert between String and SharedBuffer can now simply
        be member functions on ScriptBuffer. This also simplifies IPC code.

        "-webkit-appearance: textfield" on the search input, indicating a desire
        to remove the native search field appearance. To remove the unwanted
        icon, we should not paint decorations for search fields without
        "-webkit-appearance: searchfield".

        To achieve this behavior, adjust the -webkit-appearance value on the
        pseudo element containing the icon when the search field has a different
        -webkit-appearance value, so that the native painting is elided. The
        decision to not simply set "display: none" on the element was made so
        that sites can still customize the decoration should they choose to do
        so. Note that on macOS, Web Inspector paints their own search icon
        using the pseudo element.

        No new tests. A layout test is not possible since SearchFieldResultsButtonElement
        is inaccessible through DOM APIs. A reference mismatch test is not
        possible since changing the -webkit-appearance property on a search field
        already results in visual changes. Existing tests were rebaselined to
        account for the fact that the decoration is removed when changing
        -webkit-appearance, so we do have test coverage.

        If the searchfield's appearance is not "searchfield", adjust the
        appearance of the results button to NoControlPart. For compatibility
        reasons, the adjustment is skipped if the author has specified the
        results attribute on the searchfield. This is determined by checking
        the maxResults of the input element.

        If the adjustment needs to be performed, we elide standard style
        adjustments from the theme by setting canAdjustStyleForAppearance to
        false. Without this, the call to resolveStyle will apply native styles
        to the element, since it does not know we are about to reset appearance.

        Have the ServiceWorker process hold on to a file mapped version of the service worker scripts to save dirty memory
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224015
        <rdar://75637679>

        Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

        Since r275267, the Network process holds on the file mapped (mmap'd) versions of the service worker
        scripts instead of heap allocated versions, in order to decrease its dirty memory use. However, the
        ServiceWorker process (which is often a regular WebProcess) was still using heap allocated service
        worker scripts. This patch is a follow-up to make sure the NetworkProcess sends its file mapped
        scripts to the ServiceWorker processes as ShareableResource handles in order to decrease the dirty
        memory usage of the ServiceWorker processes as well.

        No new tests, no Web-facing behavior change, just a decrease in dirty memory use in the ServiceWorker
        processes (which may be WebProcesses). I have done local testing with a very large service worker
        that uses a ~100MB main script, which imports another ~100MB sub-script. With my change, dirty
        memory usage goes from ~440MB to ~230MB in both the cold and warm cases ("Cold" meaning that the
        service worker was just registed and downloaded from the network and "Warm" meaning that the
        service worker had been previously registed and was loaded straight from the SWScriptStorage).

        ServiceWorkerContextData to the ServiceWorker process to launch a service worker, both the
        ServiceWorker process and the Network process share the same mmap'd versions of the scripts and we
        save on dirty memory use. This helps reduce dirty memory use in the ServiceWorker process in the
        warm case, where the scripts are loaded straight from the disk (via SWScriptStorage).

        In earlier changes, the MediaSessionElement identifier was combined with the Media Element

        So we create a new method HTMLMediaElement::mediaUniqueIdentifier with a new MediaUniqueIdentifier

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        When in fullscreen, it's possible to have five different buttons to the right of "Play":
         - AirPlay
         - Enter Picture in Picture
         - Audio/Languages
         - Exit Full Screen
         - More...
        This turns the UI into something of an "icon soup" and should really be avoided, especially
        now that `OverflowButton` allows for a single button to have multiple actions (via a native
        contextmenu). This matches AVKit behavior.

        A number of public methods on AnimationTimeline make no use of any AnimationTimeline instance

        Feed preferred frames per second back to the UI process for each DisplayRefreshMonitor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224023

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        DisplayRefreshMonitors should be responsive to the frame rate demands of their clients,
        so move from a model where DisplayRefreshMonitor has setPreferredFramesPerSecond()
        to one where it computes maxClientPreferredFramesPerSecond().

        DisplayRefreshMonitor needs to recompute maxClientPreferredFramesPerSecond when clients
        are added, removed, or when the preferred frame rate of a client changes.

        For now, just one of the DisplayRefreshMonitor implementations responds to adjustPreferredFramesPerSecond:
        DisplayRefreshMonitorMac sends IPC to the UI process, which DisplayLink can use on a per-connection
        basis to throttle the frequency of display updates sent to that process (which is important
        for power).

        Assertions in DisplayUpdate when dragging WebView windows between screens with different refresh rates
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223984

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        There are various reasons why rigorous assertions in DisplayUpdate::relevantForUpdateFrequency()
        are ill advised.

        When WebKitLegacy calls windowScreenDidChange() it does not pass in a nominal display
        refresh rate, so we assume 60fps. If the screen actually has a non-60fps refresh rate, then
        we can get mixed 60/50 state in various places; this change fixes one of them, but such bugs
        have to not result in assertions or divide by zero crashes in
        DisplayUpdate::relevantForUpdateFrequency().

        The second reason is webkit.org/b/212120; we may start DisplayRefreshMonitors with DisplayID
        0 before we know what screen we're on, again risking a situation where the actual screen has
        a non-60fps refresh rate.

        To fix the case where no nominal refresh rate is passed through
        Chrome::windowScreenDidChange(), allow a DisplayRefreshMonitor to supply a rate; often, a
        DisplayRefreshMonitor can compute one from its knowledge of the display. This requires
        DisplayRefreshMonitorManager is able to create a DisplayRefreshMonitor with no client, so
        support that with a little refactoring.

        Have some DisplayRefreshMonitor implementations supply their nominal display refresh rate
        when known.

        Service Worker scripts use too much memory in the network process
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223808
        <rdar://75637093>

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        Previously, the network process would store service worker scripts in a SQLite database.
        When starting to use service workers, we would load all those scripts from the database
        into memory. This would use a decent amount of memory in the network process.

        To address the issue, the approach is this patch is to store the scripts as separate
        files on the filesystem instead. This when, when loading them, we can simply mmap() them
        and greatly reduce dirty memory usage.

        Note that the service worker process (which may be the WebContent process) also keeps a
        copy of the imported service worker scripts for the service workers it is running. More
        work will be needed in a follow-up but we should be able to extend the approach so that
        the service worker process would only have a mmap'd version of those scripts. This would
        reduce dirty memory usage on the WebContent/ServiceWorker process side as well. I am
        doing this separately though to reduce patch size and facilitate review.

        No new tests, there should be no Web-facing behavior change, just a decreased
        dirty memory usage in the network process when service workers are used.

        I did manual memory testing with a very large service worker that had one ~100MB main
        script, importing another ~100MB script.

        Here are the memory results without my change:
        - Networking (Dirty): 238MB (cold) / 331MB (warm)
        - WebContent (Dirty): 441MB (cold) / 857MB (warm)

        Here are the memory results with my change:
        - Networking (Dirty): 22MB (cold) / 14MB (warm)
        - WebContent (Dirty): 440MB (cold) / 438MB (warm)

        This shows that ALL memory from the scripts in the network process is no longer marked
        as dirty. We also see a significant progression in the WebProcess in the warm case, since
        the scripts are coming from the network process as shared memory in this case. There is
        no progression in the WebProcess in the cold case yet, since the script were just
        downloaded and are coming from the WebProcess to the NetworkProcess. In a follow-up, the
        network process could send shared memory back to the WebProcess, after saving the scripts
        to disk, so that the WebProcess can replace the copies of its scripts and save more memory.

        databasae instead of HashMap of ImportedScript since we no longer want to
        store imported script sources in the database, but rather store them
        separately on the file system.

        (WebCore::stripScriptSources):
        Utility function to convert a HashMap of ServiceWorkerContextData::ImportedScript
        into a HashMap of ImportedScriptAttributes (identical but without the script
        source), ready to save in the SQLite database.

        (WebCore::populateScriptSourcesFromDisk):
        Utility function to construct a HashMap of ServiceWorkerContextData::ImportedScript
        from a HasMap of ImportedScriptAttributes, coming from the SQLiteDatabase. The
        missing script sources are fetched from the disk via SWScriptStorage.

        now that they are stored separately.

        (WebCore::RegistrationDatabase::doPushChanges):
        - Stop storing the script sources in the SQLite database, and instead store them as separate
        files on the file system via SWScriptStorage.
        - Improve logging
        - When done storing the scripts to disk, send these new mmap'd versions back to the
          SWServerWorker on the main thread, so that it can replace it's heavy script sources with
          these ones. This helps reduce memory usage.

        (WebCore::RegistrationDatabase::importRecords):

        Add SWScriptStorage to deal with the storage / retrieval of Service
        Worker scripts to / from disk, as files on the file system. When
        going a retrieval, we return a script as a SharedBuffer which usually contains
        mmap'd() data (we don't use mmap() for files that are smaller than the PAGE_SIZE).
        The scripts reside in a Scripts/ folder, beside the database. The scripts are separated
        by origin (using SHA256 of the origin as folder name with salt), and then by registration (by
        using SHA256 of the registration scope as subfolder name with salt). The file name for the script
        is a SHA256 of the script URL with salt.

        like pause() are called on that animation, one can obtain inconsistent state for

        Allow non-60fps display updates to be driven by DisplayRefreshMonitor
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223912

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.
        
        Previously, RenderingUpdateScheduler::scheduleAnimation() would return false for any
        preferredFramesPerSecond which is not 60fps, causing RenderingUpdateScheduler to fall back
        to its timer mechanism. This meant that throttled (e.g. by low power) pages and display
        updates on non-60fps display would all use timers. This is undesirable because we want
        alignment with display refresh, and to avoid timer drift between multiple throttled
        documents.

        The fix has two parts. First, we need to fix RenderingUpdateScheduler and
        ScriptedAnimationController to compute their frame rates in terms of FramesPerSecond, rather
        than Seconds, because using the latter requires conversion to Seconds and back via
        m_page.preferredRenderingUpdateInterval() which was awkward. So have Page expose
        preferredRenderingUpdateFramesPerSecond().

        Also add preferredFramesPerSecond(), and have both it and preferredFrameInterval() take the
        "near 60fps" flag as an argument, so doing the common math in AnimationFrameRate.

        The second part of the fix is to move "preferredFramesPerSecond" from
        RenderingUpdateScheduler to DisplayRefreshMonitorClient, since clients should be able to
        request different frame rates. Then we pass the DisplayUpdate to
        DisplayRefreshMonitorClient::fireDisplayRefreshIfNeeded(), and finally use it to do the math
        of whether to skip an update for this client.

        In some cases, degenerated and corner cases of grandient stops might
        trigger really slow operations in Cairo due to extremely high bezier
        parameters. For example, the normalization-conic-2.html triggered this
        by making the conic code calculate the tangent of 90 degrees for an
        interpolation stop.

        This commit adds some special handling for these cases to make sure the

        Enable "hanging" and "each-line" keywords for the text-indent CSS property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223851

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        We've had support for "hanging" and "each-line" behind the ENABLE_CSS3_TEXT flag. Probably by mistake,
        "hanging" itself was parsed and Web-exposed by default. Presumably that was the case because that CSS
        keyword existed in the context of SVG.

        But LineWidth.cpp already knew how to handle these keywords, so there seems to be no reason to keep
        these behind a flag.

        So we remove all the ENABLE_CSS3_TEXT guards related to they keywords and address some spec compliance
        issue, namely:
        
            1. add the text-indent length or percentage, the "hanging" and "each-line" keywords in that order
               in consumeTextIndent(),
            2. use that same order for the computed style.

        Implement repetition of animated AVIF
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223127
        <rdar://problem/75629284>

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        This change implements repeating AVIF animation, reflecting the AVIF sequence spec.
        As the libavif does not provide a clear repetition count yet, we calculate it
        by dividing the track duration by the sum of each frame duration. If the track duration
        is not specified, the animation repeats indefinitely. Chromium just indefinitely
        repeats all animated avif images.
        The repetition count of avif sequence images is not necessarily an integer.
        Since ScalableImageDecoder accepts an integer value for repetition,
        we round the repetition count in floating point values to conform the current
        image decoder design. Later, when we have more reliable testing environment
        for the avifs repetition, we will revisit the repetition count in floating point numbers.

        No new tests since no reliable test could be created. The latest avif encoder
        does not support the repetition count yet.

        Currently, we have:

        void setItemBufferClient(ItemBufferWritingClient*);

        This is unfortunate, because if you want to set one of these clients to nullptr, you have to do:
        setItemBufferClient(static_cast<ItemBufferReadingClient*>(nullptr));

        Instead, we can just rename these functions to:
        void setItemBufferReadingClient(ItemBufferReadingClient*);
        void setItemBufferWritingClient(ItemBufferWritingClient*);

        So you can just do
        setItemBufferReadingClient(nullptr);

        Plumb DisplayUpdate through the display refresh monitors
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223847

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Future work will allow DisplayRefreshMonitorClients to request different frame rates, which
        are whole fractions of the display's nominal refresh rate. These various frame rate requests
        flow up through the DisplayRefreshMonitors, and in WebKit2, up through IPC to the
        per-display DisplayLink which may even service multiple processes.

        For power reasons, we don't want to trigger display refresh notifications down the chain at
        the highest possible frequency; at various stages of propagation the rate might be halved if
        that's necessary for downstream clients.
        
        To make this frequency splitting logic simple, this patch introduces DisplayUpdate, which
        represents an update of the display, and contains data about it in the form of a numerator
        is the frame index, and the denominator is the nominal frame rate. Frame index wraps to zero
        every second.
        
        For example, a 60Hz display will generate display refreshes with DisplayUpdates which
        sequentially will be { 0, 60 }, { 1, 60 }, { 2, 60 } ... { 59, 60 }, { 0, 60 }. The
        zeroth frame is at some arbitrary time and not aligned with wallclock time.
        
        Thus a client with a 30Hz update requirement can simply ignore every odd-numbered frame, and
        a client downstream from it with a 15Hz requirement, which only receives those even-numbered
        frames, still has enough information to compute which frames to ignore.
        
        Classes which are sources of callbacks for DisplayRefreshMonitor need to generate these
        DisplayUpdates; that includes the various platform DisplayRefreshMonitor subclasses in
        WebCore, and those in WebKit that live in the UI process and trigger updates over IPC.

        Add support for animating the vertical-align CSS property
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223853

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Adding support for animating vertical-align revealed a couple of long-standing issues with
        regards to our support for this property.

        First off, we didn't honor the "inherit" value since it required a custom builder method
        to deal with both RenderStyle::verticalAlign() (the type) and RenderStyle::verticalAlignLength()
        (the value).

        Then, we would hit an assertion when obtaining the computed style for this property and a
        calculated value since we didn't pass the RenderStyle to createValue().

        We now correctly interpolate this property per the dedicated WPT test, the only issues remaining
        being about how our calc serialization (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223875).

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        r274527 actually exposed a bug that was present since r271197. The AudioDestination pipeline
        was not stopping properly because webkitGstSetElementStateSynchronously() was returning too
        early.

        This patch also includes a few improvements in the webaudiosrc element, most notably
        regarding its preroll state. The element now stops emitting buffers downstream as soon as
        the AudioDestination is scheduled to stop.

        Allow DisplayRefreshMonitor to be more long-lived objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223844

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The existing behavior for DisplayRefreshMonitors was that they were created and destroyed
        frequently, as their clients are registered and unregistered. In addition, some of
        their subclasses had duplicated logic related to how often they fired without clients
        before they were removed.

        The 1:1 correspondance between DisplayRefreshMonitors and physical displays makes them
        a useful place to store per-display information (like refresh rate), which should
        persist whether or not they have clients, so this change prepares for that.
        
        The main changes in this patch are:
          1. Provide virtual startNotificationMechanism()/stopNotificationMechanism() functions on
             DisplayRefreshMonitor that subclasses can use to start their CVDisplayLink or related
             functionality.

          2. Provide some shared maxUnscheduledFireCount logic that subclasses can tune to
             provide the hysteresis used to control the start/stop of the underlying
             notification mechanism.

         3. Provide a shared dispatchDisplayDidRefresh() function that most implementations
            can use.

        DisplayRefreshMonitorManager no longer destroys DisplayRefreshMonitors when they lose
        all their clients. This means that DisplayRefreshMonitors are never removed, but there
        should only ever be as many as there are physical displays, and they are only
        active if being scheduled by clients.

        When a renderer becomes a multicol spanner 
        1. it is moved out of its original tree position and placed as a sibling of the enclosing multicolumn flow and
        2. a spanner placeholder is constructed and inserted at the original position

        This patch fixes the case when an already placed multicol spanner is internally moved (e.g. collapsing an anonymous block parent)
        and we attempt to re-insert this spanner to the multicolumn flow. No spanner state should change due to internal re-parenting.

        GraphicsContextGLOpenGL should avoid calling into ANGLE MakeCurrent
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223511

        Reviewed by Kenneth Russell.

        Avoid calling ANGLE MakeCurrent for contexts that are already current. Cache the current context pointer into a
        global variable. Currently the code adds no locking. For the forseeable future, ANGLE does not support
        simultaneous access from multiple threads.

        The optimization can be done when run in WebContent process or in GPU process, but not when in WK1. This is because in WK1,
        the 3rd party client may run arbitrary code in WebKit thread. This includes code that changes EAGL or AGL state.
        This code might change the current context underneath WebKit. In WK1 mode, we already use "volatile context" feature of
        ANGLE to reset the platform context on every EGL command. The command we use for this for normal GL commands is EGL_MakeCurrent.

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        The PR review of the update of the PCM spec lead WebKit, Mozilla, and Google to decide on two changes:
        1. Rename attributeOn to attributionDestination
        2. Change the IDL data type of attributionSourceId from DOMString to unsigned long

        The spec change can be seen in this commit:

        Drop unnecessary Settings pre-warming in ProcessWarming::prewarmGlobally(). Based on the comment,

        <rdar://problem/75357965>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        The iOS form control refresh added a magnifier symbol to
        the default appearance of <input type="search">. On iPhone, google.com
        uses <input type="search"> for their search field, while drawing their
        own magnifier symbol. As a result, two magnifier symbols appear.

        Note that on macOS and iPadOS, google.com uses an <input type="text">,
        which means this problem is only observed on iPhone. Ideally, google.com
        should adopt <input type="text"> on the iPhone version of the site,
        matching the other platforms. However, in the meantime, we can hide our
        symbol using a quirk.

        [GStreamer] Use imxvideoconvert_g2d element inside the sink when available

        On some iMX platforms we require the use of imxvideoconvert_g2d element

        rendered through our pipeline. We expect to require this buffer if it's
        present in the GStreamer plugin registry on the system.

        We search for this element and, if found, add it to the sink and
        position it at the beginning, before the glupload element.

        [Cocoa][Opus] Protect against variable frame duration packets
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223623

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Because frames-per-packet and frame duration are carried within the TOC of each individual
        frame, it's theoretically possible to construct an Opus stream where those values change
        without a new initialization segment, a situation which CoreAudio does not currently
        support. In the case such a stream is encountered, bail with an error code during parsing,
        rather than passing such data on to CoreAudio for decoding.

        To do so, extract some of the Opus private data parsing code from
        createOpusAudioFormatDescription(), into its own method parseOpusPrivateData(). Create a new
        struct type OpusCookieContents to recieve this parsed data. And to avoid excessive
        allocations during parsing, ensure that these methods support stack-based structures through
        an out-param (as opposed to returning an Optional<> struct).

        Fix issues found by UBSan in the WheelEvent constructor:
        - wheelDeltaX / wheelDeltaY have type int and we negate those values to compute deltaX / deltaY (which have type double).
          If wheelDeltaX / wheelDeltaY where INT_MIN, then -INT_MIN would overflow. To address the issue, we now cast to double
          *before* negating the value.
        - When wheelDeltaX / wheelDeltaY are initially 0, we compute their value from deltaX / deltaY. However, deltaX & deltaY
          use type double while wheelDeltaX / wheelDeltaY use type int. As a result, values for deltaX / deltaY could end up
          being out of range and not fit in wheelDeltaX / wheelDeltaY. To address the issue, we use clampTo<int>() to clamp to
          the correct destination range.

        Add assertions to guard against heap allocations on the audio thread during

        Right now, the assertions only protect audio processing, not pre/post quantum
        rendering casts. Ideally, we'd expand the scope of these assertions to cover
        everything that's done on the audio thread but this will require more fixes.

        [MSE][GStreamer] SIGSEV in webKitMediaSrcFreeStream
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220091

        Reviewed by Xabier Rodriguez-Calvar.

        The pipeline used by the MSE player is now able reload the MediaSource from the beginning if
        a seek to 0 was requested. The problem was that uridecodebin was creating a new source
        element and notifying the player which was then trying to dispose underlying platform track
        informations, and also related appsrc elements. The latter was specially problematic because
        the appsrc elements ownership was badly handled (elements added to a bin should not be
        reused, unless an extra ref is added), leading to racy crashes.

        So now when uridecodebin creates a new source element, the player detects this is a new
        source and transfers track-related informations to the new element. Additionally, new appsrc
        elements are created for the new element and track signals emitted so that the player is
        still fully aware of the MSE tracks topology.

        No new tests but two existing tests are now passing.

        A non-actionable content is considered less important than the action behind the "click". So while we trigger the hover state we immediately proceed with click as well.
        (e.g. on youtube.com, hovering over the controls (settings, volume etc) brings up a (non-actionable) tooltip and the subsequent click triggers the associated action.
        Now on iPadOS, it would require 2 taps on the mute/unmute button to actually mute/unmute the video, if we stopped at the hover state)

        Reviewed by Wenson Hsieh.

        We're moving to a design for getImageData() where the web process and the GPU process
        set up a shmem + semaphore ahead-of-time, so that when we encounter a call to getImageData(),
        the GPU process can just write into the shmem and signal the semaphore. The web process just
        encodes the getImageData() call into the regular display list, flushAsync()s to kick the GPU
        process, then just waits on the semaphore. Initial performance testing shows that this is
        way, way faster than sending messages containing pixel color data payloads.

        This patch is just the first step: Adding a GetImageData display list item. The item
        currently gets recorded in the web process and applied in the GPU process, but the application
        process currently does nothing.

        [WebIDL] Remove the need to specify [MayThrowException]
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=180019

        Reviewed by Darin Adler and Chris Dumez.

        Removes the need to specify [MayThrowException] by deducing it from the bound 
        signature's return value. Any function returning an ExceptionOr is one that throws.

        In most cases, this was already handled by toJS<>(..., impl.func()), which had
        overloads for the case that the value was an ExceptionOr. The cases this didn't
        work for were funtions that returned void, as toJS<>(..., impl.func()) would not
        compile. To work around this, toJS<>() can now take a lambda as its value, and
        can determine via the lambda's return type if it needs to throw. For instance,
        an IDL operation like:

            [MayThrowException] undefined func();

        used to generate a bindings body that looked like the following :

            auto& impl = castedThis->wrapped();
            throwScope.release();
            propagateException(*lexicalGlobalObject, throwScope, impl.func());
            return JSValue::encode(jsUndefined());        
        
        will now generate a bindings body that looks like:
        
             auto& impl = castedThis->wrapped();
             RELEASE_AND_RETURN(throwScope, JSValue::encode(toJS<IDLUndefined>(*lexicalGlobalObject, throwScope, [&]() -> decltype(auto) { return impl.func(); })));

        which closely mirrors a non-undefined return operation. This wrapped lambda form
        is only used for operations returning undefined or promises, as those are the only
        functions that can return void, but it would be correct to use them for all types,
        if not a bit more noisy and perhaps a tiny compile time cost.

        NOTE: The use of `-> decltype(auto)` explicit return type on the lambda is required
        to perfectly forward reference types, such as those used by owned promises. Otherwise,
        a copy constructor is invoked.

        In addition to supporting all operations, this also removes the requirement to annotate
        named and indexed getters/setters. This mostly just means always defining a throw scope,
        but for named getters it also meant adding a new helper, `visibleNamedPropertyItemAccessorFunctor`
        which constructors the item accessor functor for the `accessVisibleNamedProperty` 
        algorithm rather than hard coding it in the generator.

        Due to increased use of toJS, the code generator is now checking more return types
        (via AddToImplIncludesForIDLType) so the code generator was able to find a few invalid
        return types (e.g. use of Promise<bool> rather than Promise<boolean>, etc.) and these
        have been fixed and will be an error going forward. Would be a nice improvement to
        the code generator to do type checking up front, rather than as a side effect of
        code generation, but we will leave that for another day.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMAbstractOperations.h:
        (WebCore::visibleNamedPropertyItemAccessorFunctor):
        Added. Moves the getterFunctor lambda creation from the GenerateNamedGetterLambda
        subroutine in CodeGeneratorJS.pm, but uses deduction and constexpr to determine
        if the getter throws.

        (WebCore::accessVisibleNamedProperty):
        Rename Functor to ItemAccessor to make it a bit more clear what the type does.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMConvertBase.h:
        (WebCore::toJS):
        (WebCore::toJSNewlyCreated):
        Replace SFINAE-based overloading of toJS/toJSNewlyCreated with constexpr based
        conditionals and add the ability to pass in a functor rather than value. If a
        functor is used, additional code paths for void and ExpectionOr<void> are added
        which explicitly return jsUndefined().

        * bindings/js/JSDOMConvertDate.cpp:
        Remove incorrect comment about ExecStates that hasn't applied for a while.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMConvertSequences.h:
        Fix comment, replacing ExecState with JSGlobalObject. This has been wrong for
        a while, and this is just a drive by fix.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMExceptionHandling.h:
        (WebCore::invokeFunctorPropagatingExceptionIfNecessary):
        Use an explicit else as part of the constexpr expression to ensure the functor
        is not called, even in debug builds.

        * bindings/js/JSDOMPromiseDeferred.cpp:
        (WebCore::createDeferredPromise): Deleted.
        * bindings/js/JSDOMPromiseDeferred.h:
        Remove unused createDeferredPromise function.

        * bindings/scripts/CodeGeneratorJS.pm:
        (AddMapLikeAttributesAndOperationIfNeeded):
        (AddSetLikeAttributesAndOperationIfNeeded):
        Fix return type of mapped clear operation to be `any` rather than `undefined`
        to match the implementation, which returns a JSValue (e.g. `any`). This is now
        required as we actually look at the return type via deduction and need it to match.
 
        (GenerateNamedGetterLambda):
        Replace most of the implementation with a call to the new `visibleNamedPropertyItemAccessorFunctor`
        helper which returns a lambda with the correct behavior depending on the return type of the inner
        lambda passed.
 
        (GenerateGetOwnPropertySlot):
        (GenerateGetOwnPropertySlotByIndex):
        (GenerateAttributeGetterBodyDefinition):
        Match most other parts of the generator and always create a throw scope.

        (GenerateOperationDefinition):
        Remove explicit call to propagateException now that toJS() will handle that for us.

        (GenerateParametersCheck):
        Remove explicit call to propagateException now that toJS() will handle that for us.

        (GenerateImplementationFunctionCall):
        Simplify by using invokeFunctorPropagatingExceptionIfNecessary helper for the "returnArgumentName"
        case and relying on toJS handling the other cases.

        (NativeToJSValueMayThrow):
        Add operation to the list of things that might always throw.

        (NativeToJSValue):
        Use the lambda wrapped version of toJS for undefined and promise types, which might both
        return void and thus require it. To keep most code unchanged, and avoid unnecessary compiler
        work, we only use the wrapped version when it might be necessary. If it turns out to be
        cheep enough, it might make sense to always use this form for simplicity.

        (NeedsExplicitPropagateExceptionCall): Deleted.

        * bindings/scripts/IDLAttributes.json:
        Remove MayThrowException.

        * dom/Element.idl:
        * dom/Element.h:
        (WebCore::Element::removeAttributeForBindings):
        (WebCore::Element::removeAttributeNSForBindings):
        Add bindings specific versions of `removeAttribute` and `removeAttributeNS` which
        have a void return type (rather than the bool used by the main implementation)
        as it is now a requirement that that the bound functions signature match the IDL.

        * Modules/cache/DOMCache.idl:
        Use the correct interface name, `FetchRequest`, not `Request`.

        * Modules/cache/DOMCacheStorage.idl:
        Use the correct interface name, `DOMCache`, not `Cache`.

        Update whenSignalAborted to match the return type of implementation, which is `boolean`,
        not `undefined`.

        * testing/ServiceWorkerInternals.idl:
        Use the correct interface name, `FetchResponse`, not `Response`.

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        NowPlaying and RemoteCommandListener kind of do the same things, as such it make sense to combine the two
        and hide the implementation details from consumers.
        We move the handling of setting and clearing the NowPlayingInfo information to an expanded
        NowPlayingManager which now also runs in the webcontent process.
        The job to ensure a RemoteCommandListener is set is now up to the NowPlayingManager as well as
        dealing with changes in NowPlayingInfo content.
        Ideally we would prefer to remove all code related to MediaRemote from MediaSessionManagerCocoa;
        however for ease we leave it there to avoid having to deal with objective-C interface in NowPlayingManager.
        No change in observable behavior.

        REGRESSION(r272433): Inspector should not instrument inside `WebCore::Node::setRenderer`

        Existing test coverage:

        The previous approach to observing render changes was most likely a performance regression in a very hot code
        path (`Node::setRenderer`). This patch resolves this by not instrumenting in this the hot path. Instead we call
        inspector instrumentation inside the constructors/destructors of only the RenderObject subclasses we are
        interested in observing layout changes for.

        Additionally, layout change events are now added to a `Vector` of pending changes, which will be sent to the
        front-end later in order to avoid evaluating JavaScript inside a destructor in WK1 with the new instrumentation
        points.

        [iOS] Composition text is not initially highlighted when typing in text fields using Pinyin keyboard
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223563
        <rdar://problem/75564516>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        When enabling line layout integration, composition highlights on iOS don't appear when typing an input string
        using the Pinyin keyboard for the first time. This is because the text renderer for the inserted composition
        text does not contain inline text boxes when painting the composition text on iOS, so the marked text painting
        codepath is never triggered.

        On macOS, this isn't an issue because the process of setting the composition changes the selection, which then
        changes the highlight state of the `RenderText`, which subsequently calls into `ensureLineBoxes()`. However,
        since selections are drawn using UIKit in the UI process on iOS, we don't end up ensuring that inline text boxes
        are constructed for the inserted text.

        To address this, we follow macOS behavior by ensuring line box construction on the rendered composition text
        when setting the composition.

        Avoid heap allocation under AudioNodeInput::disable() / AudioNodeInput::enable()

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        Avoid heap allocation under AudioNodeInput::disable() / AudioNodeInput::enable() since those can
        get called on the audio thread.

        AudioNodeInput used to have a m_disabledOutputs container to keep disabled outputs separated
        from enabled ones (in m_outputs). Instead, we now store all outputs in m_outputs with a 'isEnabled'
        flag. As a result, we no longer need to make any heap allocations when enabling/disabling an
        output, we merely need to flip a flag in m_outputs.

        For convenience, since clients of rendering outputs only care about enabled outputs, I introduced
        a new RenderingOutputCollection container with iterators. This way clients do not need to worry
        about disabled outputs.

        Cannot login to microsoftonline.com without allowing storage access

        <rdar://problem/75619058>

        Reviewed by John Wilander.

        This patch introduces two changes: 

        1. Activate the storage access quirks for default browsers only. This
        is the main place we test them, and can lead to unexpected behavior in
        apps otherwise.

        2. Doesn't cancel the click even if the user denies storage access.
        Previously we we were not allowing the click because it produces
        unexpected behavior. But, sites like login.microsoftonline.com are used
        by multiple Microsoft login flows. Since only a subset require storage
        access, canceling the click across the board could be considered
        regressing behavior.

        Since storage access data is stored in the network process, we
        currently cancel the user's click on quirked sites while we wait
        asyncronously for the IPC response. If the user grants storage access,
        we store this in the web content process and dispatch a synthetic
        click. In this case, when the click triggers another storage access
        check, we can allow the click because we no longer need to wait for
        information from the network process.

        We need some heuristic in the web content process to handle the case
        of the user denying storage access to know whether to allow a
        synthetic click to happen. This patch introduces
        hasDeniedCrossPageStorageAccess which stores domains in the web
        content process which have been denied storage access via quirk. If
        a user has previously denied storage access in that web content
        process, we don't prompt again. A new web content process will give them
        another opportunity to allow/deny storage access.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Currently, when a RenderTableRow is detached from its parent, we will
        check whether all of the remaining RenderTableRow siblings are anonymous
        before deciding to merge them.  This means that if removing the
        RenderTableRow would produce a sequence of anonymous RenderTableRows
        that could be collapsed, but we have some other non-anonymous
        RenderTableRow as a sibling, then we'll incorrectly skip the collapsing.

        Instead we should look only to the previous and next sibling, and
        collapse them together if they're both anonymous.

        Animated AVIF support

        <rdar://problem/75362181>

        Reviewed by Philippe Normand.

        This change implements animation of the avif sequence. The decoding approach
        is similar to ones for other image formats, i.e., decoding frames in BGRA pixels
        then bit-copying them into ScalableImageDecoderFrame. The decoded frames are cached
        for future use. The repetition is missing in this change. It will be addressed
        in separate patches.

        The added avif animation test compares the last frame of each avifs and a static
        avif image. The embeded avifs images are originated from corresponding webp images
        for animated-webp.html, and encoded with timescale 100 (i.e., the duration of each frame
        is 0.01s). The total duration and the track duration are same so the added avifs samples
        are supposed to be played one time.
