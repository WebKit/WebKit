Changes for 1.0.0 'Peregrine falcon':
-------------------------------------

1.0.0 is a major release of dav1d, adding important features and bug fixes.

It notably changes, in an important way, the way threading works, by adding
an automatic thread management.

It also adds support for AVX-512 acceleration, and adds speedups to existing x86
code (from SSE2 to AVX2).

1.0.0 adds new grain API to ease acceleration on the GPU, and adds an API call
to get information of which frame failed to decode, in error cases.

Finally, 1.0.0 fixes numerous small bugs that were reported since the beginning
of the project to have a proper release.
