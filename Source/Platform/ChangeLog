        [GTK] libPlatform, libPlatformGtk must depend on the related GNUmakefiles
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115937

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        * GNUmakefile.am: Set up an artifical dependency so that libPlatform and libPlatformGtk
        libraries take into account any changes in this GNUmakefile.am and the GNUmakefile.list.am
        located under Source/WebCore. The latter is included due to all the build targets for the
        two libraries being listed there.

        [GTK] Set up libPlatform.la
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114168

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        * GNUmakefile.am: Set up the libPlatform.la static library to build the source files listed in platform_sources.
        As with the libPlatformGtk.la library, only the Source/WebCore/platform and its subdirectories are allowed to be
        searched for headers to include, providing a convenient way to detect any platform violations. These directories
        are listed in the platform_webcore_cppflags variable.
