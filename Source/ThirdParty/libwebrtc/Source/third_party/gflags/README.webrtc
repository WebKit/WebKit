Description:
The gflags package contains a library that implements commandline
flags processing. As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has
increased flexibility, including built-in support for C++ types like
string, and the ability to define flags in the source file in which
they're used.

How to update platform configuration files:
The gen/ directory contains pre-generated configuration header files.
Historically, all operating systems and architectures have generated
similar configurations except for Windows. This is why there's only
posix and win directories below gen/.
When rolling gflags to a newer version, it's a good idea to check if
new configuration files needs to be generated as well.
Do this by running cmake in the newly checked out version of
gflags. Then diff the generated files with the ones below gen/.
If you notice a diff, update the files with the updated ones.
If you suspect platform dependend changes other than Windows, you'll
have to checkout gflags on the other platforms as well and run
cmake there too.
