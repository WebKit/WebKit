Description:
Provides tools for:
 - creating AV1 bitstreams for storage and transmission.
 - decoding AV1 bitstreams for display.

Please follow these steps to update libaom source code:

1. Update the code:
     roll_dep.py \
       -r <libaom OWNER> \
       --log-limit 20 \
       --roll-to <libaom hash> \
       src/third_party/libaom/source/libaom

   Use the generated commit message for the roll.

Note: When running roll_dep.py on a Chrome release branch, we get the
error message:
   error: Ensure chromium/src is clean first (no non-merged commits).

because the is_prestine() function in roll_dep.py runs git diff against
origin/main. A workaround is to edit roll_dep.py and change
'origin/main' to the release branch, e.g., 'branch-heads/5414' for the
Chrome M109 release branch. Remember to change it back to 'origin/main'
after running roll_dep.py.

2. Generate the config files:
     # See prerequisites in file comments.
     ./cmake_update.sh

   This will also update this file with the new revision.
   Update 'Version' and 'CPEPrefix' in this file if necessary.

3. Amend the commit created by the first step:

     git commit -a --amend

4. Upload the change to Gerrit:

     git cl upload

   Run tryjobs:

     git cl try

5. Send out for review when all tryjobs pass. Submit it when +1 is granted.
