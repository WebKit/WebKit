// many future steps will also be small, and that won't have much effect
// on the ultimate result. So we can terminate early.
//
// To look at it another way, when we take a small step, that means that
// either we're near to convergence (so can stop), or we're stuck in a
// shallow valley and will take many iterations to get unstuck.
//
// Solving the latter properly requires fancier methods, such as "gradient
// descent with momentum". For now, we terminate to avoid wasting a ton of
// time on points which are either nearly-converged or stuck.
