Description:
A feature-complete, generic and customizable resizable
array implementation in pure C that supports almost
the entire C++ std::vector API, including iterators.

Local Modifications:
1. Renamed some functions to fit in with the AOMedia
naming convention.
2. Removed non-global functions from vector.h.
3. Made all non-global functions in vector.c static.
