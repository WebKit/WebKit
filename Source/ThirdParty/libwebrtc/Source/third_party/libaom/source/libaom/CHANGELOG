2024-04-09 v3.9.0
  This release includes new codec interfaces, compression efficiency and
  perceptual improvements, speedup for RTC for both video and screen content,
  and many bug fixes. This release is ABI compatible with the previous release.

  - New Features
    * New codec control
      * AV1E_SET_SVC_FRAME_DROP_MODE is added to configure the SVC encoder to
        only drop spatial layers or the whole superframe.
    * Active Map is fixed and tested for RTC.
    * CONFIG_QUANT_MATRIX is added to disable quantization matrices when aom
      decoder is disabled with CONFIG_AV1_DECODER. Reduces ~10% binary size when
      both are disabled.
    * libwebm is updated to libwebm-1.0.0.31-1-gaffd7f4.

  - Compression Efficiency Improvements
    * RTC encoding improvements
      * 1-2% BD-rate gain for screen content with temporal layers; 5% BD-rate
        gain on scrolling content.

  - Perceptual Quality Improvements
    * For RTC screen content
      * Reduced color artifacts for RTC screen content
      * Visual quality improved for scene changes for SVC with quality layers.
      * Removed visual artifacts for speed 11

  - Speedups:
    * RTC Speed 11: aggressive speedup setting added for video mode,
      resolutions <= VGA: ~30% faster than speed 10.
    * 5-9% speed up for high bit-depth encoding with good mode on Arm, half of
      which comes from SVE/SVE2 optimizations.

  - Other improvements
    * Further improvements to global motion estimation.
    * Documented minimum required SIMD support: SSE4.1 on x86, Neon on Arm.
    * Remove unneeded SIMD functions, saving >100 KiB from binary size.
    * Cleaned up and improved pattern_search.
    * Added end-to-end c vs SIMD bit-exactness test.
    * Added config flag to calc psnr using libvmaf peak: use a slightly
      different peak value for PSNR (1020 and 2040 for 10- and 12-bit)

2022-06-17 v3.4.0
  This release includes compression efficiency and perceptual quality
  improvements, speedup and memory optimizations, and some new features.
  There are no ABI or API breaking changes in this release.

  - New Features
    * New --dist-metric flag with "qm-psnr" value to use quantization
      matrices in the distortion computation for RD search. The default
      value is "psnr".
    * New command line option "--auto-intra-tools-off=1" to make
      all-intra encoding faster for high bit rate under
      "--deltaq-mode=3" mode.
    * New rate control library aom_av1_rc for real-time hardware
      encoders. Supports CBR for both one spatial layer and SVC.
    * New image format AOM_IMG_FMT_NV12 can be used as input to the
      encoder. The presence of AOM_IMG_FMT_NV12 can be detected at
      compile time by checking if the macro AOM_HAVE_IMG_FMT_NV12 is
      defined.
    * New codec controls for the encoder:
      o AV1E_SET_AUTO_INTRA_TOOLS_OFF. Only in effect if
        --deltaq-mode=3.
      o AV1E_SET_RTC_EXTERNAL_RC
      o AV1E_SET_FP_MT. Only supported if libaom is built with
        -DCONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE=1.
      o AV1E_GET_TARGET_SEQ_LEVEL_IDX
    * New key-value pairs for the key-value API:
      o --auto-intra-tools-off=0 (default) or 1. Only in effect if
        --deltaq-mode=3.
      o --strict-level-conformance=0 (default) or 1
      o --fp-mt=0 (default) or 1. Only supported if libaom is built
        with -DCONFIG_FRAME_PARALLEL_ENCODE=1.
    * New aomenc options (not supported by the key-value API):
      o --nv12

  - Compression Efficiency Improvements
    * Correctly calculate SSE for high bitdepth in skip mode, 0.2% to
      0.6% coding gain.
    * RTC at speed 9/10: BD-rate gain of ~4/5%
    * RTC screen content coding: many improvements for real-time screen
      at speed 10 (quality, speedup, and rate control), up to high
      resolutions (1080p).
    * RTC-SVC: fixes to make intra-only frames work for spatial layers.
    * RTC-SVC: quality improvements for temporal layers.
    * AV1 RT: A new passive rate control strategy for screen content, an
      average of 7.5% coding gain, with some clips of 20+%. The feature
      is turned off by default due to higher bit rate variation.

  - Perceptual Quality Improvements
    * RTC: Visual quality improvements for high speeds (9/10)
    * Improvements in coding quality for all intra mode

      ~10% speedup for speed 9/10 in real time encoding mode
    * ~20% heap memory reduction in still-picture encoding mode for
      360p-720p resolutions with multiple threads
    * ~13% speedup for speed 6 and ~12% speedup for speed 9 in
      still-picture encoding mode.

      encoding mode.
