This directory demonstrates how to build a yasm builtin module as a plugin.
This can be useful for integrating custom changes without
rebuilding/reinstalling yasm.

It requires access to the yasm source.  It defaults to assuming it is being
built inside of the yasm source tree.

To build:
  mkdir objdir
  cd objdir
  cmake ..
  make

Testing (on Windows):
  yasm -N Release/x86mod.dll -f x86 ...

Testing (on Unix):
  yasm -N ./libx86mod.so -f x86 ...
