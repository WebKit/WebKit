Changelog

2.4.0-pre (This version)

2.3.0

Major changes

A fuzzer was added to the project based on libFuzzer. This is run as part of Google oss-fuzz, the current status can be found at https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/index.html#libsrtp . Details available in PR #442 and issue #393.

CMake support was added as an alternative build system. This was primarily added to replace the Visual Studio project files currently checked in but has been extend to support building on all platforms. Initial PR #449 and #455 but has been support has been continuously improved. 

NSS support for crypto backend was added. This is can be used as an alternative to openssl. Initial PR #413 but there has been numerous improvements.

PR #474 - Add flag to disable pcap dependency when build test apps.

PR #472 - Add ci builds for ios and android.

PR #463 - problem on srtp_aes_icm_openssl_encrypt.

PR #471 - Allow the pcap file to be read from a physical file.

PR #457 - Fix docs crypto_policy_* -> srtp_crypto_policy_* .

PR #452 - crypto/cipher: Reset the EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure before each test.

PR #444 - Extend rtp_ecoder to support RTCP and multiplexed SSRC's.

PR #443 - rtp_decoder avoid crash when no packets found.

PR #429 - Rand for test only.

PR #421 - Fix GCM IV logging.

PR #415 - Fixes unaligned trailer access.

PR #414 - Detect and handle broken "OPENSSL_cleanse".

2.2.0

Major changes

All code has been reformatted to be consistent. A .clang-format file and format.sh script has been added that can be use to verify and enforce consistent formatting. An automated check on code formatting is now part of travis build.

2.1.0

Compatibility changes

  PR #253 - Cipher type cleanup for AES
    When libSRTP is compiled with OpenSSL and the AES 256 ICM cipher is used
    with RTCP an incorrect initialization vector is formed.
    This change will break backwards compatibility with older versions (1.5,
    2.0) of libSRTP when using the AES 256 ICM cipher with OpenSSL for RTCP.

  PR #259 - Sequence number incorrectly masked for AES GCM IV
    The initialization vector for AES GCM encryption was incorrectly formed on
    little endian machines.
    This change will break backwards compatibility with older versions (1.5,
    2.0) of libSRTP when using the AES GCM cipher for RTCP.

  PR #287 - Fix OOB read in key generation for encrypted headers with GCM ciphers
    Adds padding of GCM salt to the corresponding ICM length used for header
    encryption.
    This change will break backwards compatibility with version 2.0 of libSRTP
    when using the header encryption extension with the AES GCM cipher.

Major changes

  PR #204 - OpenSSL performance improvements
    Changed key expansion to occur once per key instead of once per packet.

  PR #209 - Restore AES-192 under BoringSSL
    BoringSSL supports AES-192 and is now enabled in libSRTP.

  PR #224 - Master Key Identifiers (MKI) Support patch
    Adds MKI support with up to 4 keys.

  PR #234 - Report SSRC instead of srtp_stream_t in srtp_event_data_t
    srtp_stream_t is an opaque type making the event framework almost useless.
    Now the SSRC is returned instead for use as a key in the public API.

  PR #238 - Configure changes and improvements
    CFLAGS check more shell neutral, quotation fixes, always generate and
    install pkg-config file, improved OpenSSL discovery and linking, remove
    -fPIC flag on Windows, fix shared library generation under Cygwin, replace
    hardcoded CFLAGS with compiler checks, and regenerate configure after
    configure.in changes.

  PR #241 & PR #261 - Improved logging API to receive log messages from libSRTP
    Provides a logging API and the ability to enable logging to stdout and a
    file, as well as a switch to enable all internal debug modules.

  PR #289 - Added support for set and get the roll-over-counter
    Adds an API to set and get the ROC in an (S)RTP session.

  PR #304 - Fix (S)RTP and (S)RTCP for big endian machines
    The structures srtp_hdr_t, srtcp_hdr_t and srtcp_trailer_t were defined
    incorrectly on big endian systems.
