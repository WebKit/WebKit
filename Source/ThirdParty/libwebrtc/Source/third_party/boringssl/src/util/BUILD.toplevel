# By default, the C files will expect assembly files, if any, to be linked in
# with the build. This default can be flipped with -DOPENSSL_NO_ASM. If building
# in a configuration where we have no assembly optimizations, -DOPENSSL_NO_ASM
# has no effect, and either value is fine.
#
# Like C files, assembly files are wrapped in #ifdef (or NASM equivalent), so it
# is safe to include a file for the wrong platform in the build. It will just
# output an empty object file. However, we need some platform selectors to
# distinguish between gas or NASM syntax.
#
# For all non-Windows platforms, we use gas assembly syntax and can assume any
# GCC-compatible toolchain includes a gas-compatible assembler.
#
# For Windows, we use NASM on x86 and x86_64 and gas, specifically
# clang-assembler, on aarch64. We have not yet added NASM support to this build,
# and would need to detect MSVC vs clang-cl for aarch64 so, for now, we just
# disable assembly on Windows across the board.
#
# These two selects for asm_sources and asm_copts must be kept in sync. If we
# specify assembly, we don't want OPENSSL_NO_ASM. If we don't specify assembly,
# we want OPENSSL_NO_ASM, in case the C files expect them in some format (e.g.
# NASM) this build file doesn't yet support.
