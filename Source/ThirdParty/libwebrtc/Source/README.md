**WebRTC is a free, open software project** that provides browsers and mobile
applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs.
The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.

**Our mission:** To enable rich, high-quality RTC applications to be
developed for the browser, mobile platforms, and IoT devices, and allow them
all to communicate via a common set of protocols.

The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera,
amongst others. This page is maintained by the Google Chrome team.
