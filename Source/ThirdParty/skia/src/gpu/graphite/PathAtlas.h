/**
 * PathAtlas manages one or more atlas textures that store coverage masks for path rendering.
 *
 * The contents of a PathAtlas are intended to be transient: atlas regions are considered valid only
 * for the scope of the render passes that sample them. Unlike DrawAtlas, PathAtlas does not
 * necessarily support partial eviction and reuse of subregions. In most subclasses, once an atlas
 * texture is filled up all of its sub-allocations must be invalidated before it can be reused.
 *
 * PathAtlas does not prescribe how atlas contents get uploaded to the GPU. The specific task
 * mechanism is defined by subclasses.

     *
     * Returns an empty result if a the shape cannot fit in the atlas. Otherwise, returns the
     * CoverageMaskShape (including the texture proxy) for sampling the eventually-rendered coverage
     * mask and the device-space origin the mask should be drawn at (e.g. its recorded draw should
     * be an integer translation matrix), and the Renderer that should be used to draw that shape.
     * The Renderer should have single-channel coverage, require AA bounds outsetting, and have a
     * single renderStep.
     *
     * The bounds of the atlas entry is laid out with a 1 pixel outset from the given dimensions.
     * The returned shape's UV origin accounts for the padding, and its mask size does not include
     * the padding. This allows the mask to be sampled safely with linear filtering without worrying
     * about HW filtering accessing pixels from other entries.
     *
     * `shape` will be drawn after applying the linear components (scale, rotation, skew) of the
     * provided `localToDevice` transform. This is done by  translating the shape by the inverse of
     * the rounded out `transformedShapeBounds` offset. For an unclipped shape this amounts to
     * translating it back to its origin while preserving any sub-pixel translation. For a clipped
     * shape, this ensures that the visible portions of the mask are centered in the atlas slot
     * while invisible portions that would lie outside the atlas slot get clipped out.
     *
     * `addShape()` schedules the shape to be drawn but when and how the rendering happens is
     * specified by the subclass implementation.
     *
     * The stroke-and-fill style is drawn as a single combined coverage mask containing the stroke
     * and the fill.
