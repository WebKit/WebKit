If you want to write code that uses the Skia library, this is the place for you.

The Skia graphics library can be used for drawing Text, Geometries, and Images:

  * 3x3 matrices w/ perspective
  * antialiasing, transparency, filters
  * shaders, xfermodes, maskfilters, patheffects
  * subpixel text

Device backends for Skia currently include:

  * Raster
  * OpenGL
  * PDF
  * XPS
  * SVG
  * Picture (for recording and then playing back into another Canvas)
