# ES1 Status

ES1 is implemented entirely in the front-end using features from GLES3.0.  Therefore, every backend
with GLES3 support (i.e. everything other than D3D9) supports GLES1 as well.

ANGLE passes GLES1's `MustPass`, however there are known missing features.

### Notes [1]
* Logic op is implemented through the `ANGLE_logic_op` or `EXT_framebuffer_fetch` extensions.
* Currently, these are supported on the Vulkan and GL backends only.
