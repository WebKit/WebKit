Description:
Turbine is a header compiler for Java. This library does not provide versioning
or maven releases, so we need to pull it in and build it ourselves.

Since we have no working non-android java proto processor, we cannot yet build
it in GN. Thus build it manually and upload to cipd for now.

Commands to update:
- Log into cipd if necessary: `cipd auth-login`
- Update //DEPS 'src/third_party/turbine/src' commit to latest on github, see
  https://github.com/google/turbine/commits/master, and `gclient sync`.
  - Also update the revision in this file.
- Ensure current working directory is `src/third_party/turbine`
```
mvn package -DskipTests=true -q -f src/pom.xml
cp -f src/target/turbine-0.1-SNAPSHOT-all-deps.jar turbine.jar
cipd create --pkg-def cipd.yaml
```
- Update //DEPS with the hash id from the cipd create command output.
