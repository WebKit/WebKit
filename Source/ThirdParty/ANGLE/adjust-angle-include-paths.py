# WebKit builds ANGLE as a static library, and exports some of the
# internal header files as "public headers" in the Xcode project for
# consumption by other build targets - e.g. WebCore.
#
# The build phase which copies these headers also flattens the
# directory structure (so that "ANGLE" is the top-level directory
# containing all of them - e.g., "#include <ANGLE/gl2.h>").
#
# It isn't practical to override the include paths so drastically for
# the other build targets (like WebCore) that we could make the
# original include paths, like <GLES2/gl2.h> work. Changing them so
# their namespace is "ANGLE", which implicitly occurs during the "copy
# headers" phase, is a reasonable solution.
#
# This script processes the header files after they're copied during
# the Copy Header Files build phase, and adjusts their #includes so
# that they refer to each other. This avoids modifying the ANGLE
# sources, and allows WebCore to more easily call ANGLE APIs directly.
