# in time, but because of the space cost of 1, it's not that obvious.
# Nevertheless, one huge difference is the handling of `$0'.  If `from'
# uses `$0', then with 1, `to''s `$0' is `to', while it is `from' in 2.
# The user would certainly prefer to see `to'.

# too many people forget to quote the first argument of m4_define.
#
# For instance in the following case:
#   m4_define(foo, [bar])
# then a second reading will turn into
#   m4_define(bar, [bar])
# which is certainly not what was meant.

## ------------------------------------ ##
## 5. Additional branching constructs.  ##
## ------------------------------------ ##

# Both `m4_ifval' and `m4_ifset' tests against the empty string.  The
# difference is that `m4_ifset' is specialized on macros.
#
# In case of arguments of macros, eg. $1, it makes little difference.
# In the case of a macro `FOO', you don't want to check `m4_ifval(FOO,
# TRUE)', because if `FOO' expands with commas, there is a shifting of
# the arguments.  So you want to run `m4_ifval([FOO])', but then you just
# compare the *string* `FOO' against `', which, of course fails.
#
# So you want the variation `m4_ifset' that expects a macro name as $1.
# If this macro is both defined and defined to a non empty value, then
# it runs TRUE, etc.


# m4_ifblank(COND, [IF-BLANK], [IF-TEXT])
# m4_ifnblank(COND, [IF-TEXT], [IF-BLANK])
# ----------------------------------------
# If COND is empty, or consists only of blanks (space, tab, newline),
# then expand IF-BLANK, otherwise expand IF-TEXT.  This differs from
# m4_ifval only if COND has just whitespace, but it helps optimize in
# spite of users who mistakenly leave trailing space after what they
# thought was an empty argument:
#   macro(
#         []
#        )

# Writing one macro in terms of the other causes extra overhead, so

# ---------------
# Manipulate m4 lists.  m4_car returns the first argument.  m4_cdr

# _m4_cdr(ARGS...)
# ----------------
# Like m4_cdr, except include a leading comma unless only one argument
# remains.  Why?  Because comparing a large list against [] is more
# expensive in expansion time than comparing the number of arguments; so
# _m4_cdr can be used to reduce the number of arguments when it is time
# to end recursion.

# m4_cond(TEST1, VAL1, IF-VAL1, TEST2, VAL2, IF-VAL2, ..., [DEFAULT])
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Similar to m4_if, except that each TEST is expanded when encountered.
# If the expansion of TESTn matches the string VALn, the result is IF-VALn.
# The result is DEFAULT if no tests passed.  This macro allows
# short-circuiting of expensive tests, where it pays to arrange quick
# filter tests to run first.
#
# For an example, consider a previous implementation of _AS_QUOTE_IFELSE:
#
#    m4_if(m4_index([$1], [\]), [-1], [$2],
#          m4_eval(m4_index([$1], [\\]) >= 0), [1], [$2],

#          m4_eval(m4_index([$1], [\"]) >= 0), [1], [$3],
#          [$2])
#
# Here, m4_index is computed 5 times, and m4_eval 4, even if $1 contains
# no backslash.  It is more efficient to do:
#
#    m4_cond([m4_index([$1], [\])], [-1], [$2],

# this version requires an argument, since there is no convenient way
# in m4 1.4.x to grab the names of all defined macros.  Newer m4
# always dumps to stderr, regardless of the current debugfile; it also
# provides m4symbols as a way to grab all current macro names.  But
# dumpdefs is not frequently called, so we don't need to worry about
# conditionally using these newer features.  Also, this version
# doesn't sort multiple arguments.

# m4_expand(ARG)
# _m4_expand(ARG)
# ---------------
# Return the expansion of ARG as a single string.  Unlike

#
# Unfortunately, due to limitations in m4, ARG must expand to
# something with balanced quotes (use quadrigraphs to get around
# this), and should not contain the unlikely delimiters -=<{( or
# )}>=-.  It is possible to have unbalanced quoted `(' or `)', as well
# as unbalanced unquoted `)'.  m4_expand can handle unterminated
# comments or dnl on the final line, at the expense of speed; it also
# aids in detecting attempts to incorrectly change the current
# diversion inside ARG.  Meanwhile, _m4_expand is faster but must be
# given a terminated expansion, and has no safety checks for
# mis-diverted text.
#
# Exploit that extra unquoted () will group unquoted commas and the
# following whitespace.  m4_bpatsubst can't handle newlines inside $1,
# and m4_substr strips quoting.  So we (ab)use m4_changequote, using
# temporary quotes to remove the delimiters that conveniently included
# the unquoted () that were added prior to the changequote.
#
# Thanks to shell case statements, too many people are prone to pass
# underquoted `)', so we try to detect that by passing a marker as a
# fourth argument; if the marker is not present, then we assume that
# we encountered an early `)', and re-expand the first argument, but
# this time with one more `(' in the second argument and in the
# open-quote delimiter.  We must also ignore the slop from the

# ----------------
# Remove one layer of quotes from each ARG, performing one level of

# Implementing `foreach' loops in m4 is much more tricky than it may
# seem.  For example, the old M4 1.4.4 manual had an incorrect example,
# which looked like this (when translated to m4sugar):
#
# | # foreach(VAR, (LIST), STMT)
# | m4_define([foreach],
# |   [m4_pushdef([$1])_foreach([$1], [$2], [$3])m4_popdef([$1])])
# | m4_define([_arg1], [$1])
# | m4_define([_foreach],
# |   [m4_if([$2], [()], ,
# |     [m4_define([$1], _arg1$2)$3[]_foreach([$1], (m4_shift$2), [$3])])])
#
# But then if you run
#
# | m4_define(a, 1)
# | m4_define(b, 2)
# | m4_define(c, 3)
# | foreach([f], [([a], [(b], [c)])], [echo f
# | ])
#
# it gives
#
#  => echo 1
#  => echo (2,3)
#
# which is not what is expected.
#
# Of course the problem is that many quotes are missing.  So you add
# plenty of quotes at random places, until you reach the expected
# result.  Alternatively, if you are a quoting wizard, you directly
# reach the following implementation (but if you really did, then
# apply to the maintenance of m4sugar!).
#
# | # foreach(VAR, (LIST), STMT)
# | m4_define([foreach], [m4_pushdef([$1])_foreach($@)m4_popdef([$1])])
# | m4_define([_arg1], [[$1]])
# | m4_define([_foreach],
# |  [m4_if($2, [()], ,
# |    [m4_define([$1], [_arg1$2])$3[]_foreach([$1], [(m4_shift$2)], [$3])])])
#
# which this time answers
#
#  => echo a
#  => echo (b
#  => echo c)
#
# Bingo!
#
# Well, not quite.
#
# With a better look, you realize that the parens are more a pain than
# a help: since anyway you need to quote properly the list, you end up
# with always using an outermost pair of parens and an outermost pair
# of quotes.  Rejecting the parens both eases the implementation, and
# simplifies the use:
#
# | # foreach(VAR, (LIST), STMT)
# | m4_define([foreach], [m4_pushdef([$1])_foreach($@)m4_popdef([$1])])
# | m4_define([_arg1], [$1])
# | m4_define([_foreach],
# |  [m4_if($2, [], ,
# |    [m4_define([$1], [_arg1($2)])$3[]_foreach([$1], [m4_shift($2)], [$3])])])
#
#
# Now, just replace the `$2' with `m4_quote($2)' in the outer `m4_if'
# to improve robustness, and you come up with a nice implementation
# that doesn't require extra parentheses in the user's LIST.
#
# But wait -  now the algorithm is quadratic, because every recursion of
# the algorithm keeps the entire LIST and merely adds another m4_shift to
# the quoted text.  If the user has a lot of elements in LIST, you can
# bring the system to its knees with the memory m4 then requires, or trip
# the m4 --nesting-limit recursion factor.  The only way to avoid
# quadratic growth is ensure m4_shift is expanded prior to the recursion.
# Hence the design below.
#
# The M4 manual now includes a chapter devoted to this issue, with
# the lessons learned from m4sugar.  And still, this design is only
# optimal for M4 1.6; see foreach.m4 for yet more comments on why
# M4 1.4.x uses yet another implementation.


# m4_foreach(VARIABLE, LIST, EXPRESSION)
# --------------------------------------

# Expand EXPRESSION assigning each value of the LIST to VARIABLE.
# LIST should have the form `item_1, item_2, ..., item_n', i.e. the
# whole list must *quoted*.  Quote members too if you don't want them
# to be expanded.
#
# This macro is robust to active symbols:

#     => -active--active-
#
# This macro is called frequently, so avoid extra expansions such as
# m4_ifval and dnl.  Also, since $2 might be quite large, try to use it
# as little as possible in _m4_foreach; each extra use requires that much
# more memory for expansion.  So, rather than directly compare $2 against
# [] and use m4_car/m4_cdr for recursion, we instead unbox the list (which
# requires swapping the argument order in the helper), insert an ignored

# of a list of arguments by using a single-quoted comma as the
# separator.  For each empty sublist, m4_map_sep skips the expansion
# of MACRO and SEPARATOR, while m4_mapall_sep expands MACRO with no
# arguments.
#
# For m4_mapall_sep, merely expand the first iteration without the
# separator, then include separator as part of subsequent recursion;
# but avoid extra expansion of LIST's side-effects via a helper macro.
# For m4_map_sep, things are trickier - we don't know if the first
# list element is an empty sublist, so we must define a self-modifying
# helper macro and use that as the separator instead.

## 10. Defining macros with bells and whistles.  ##
## --------------------------------------------- ##

# `m4_defun' is basically `m4_define' but it equips the macro with the
# needed machinery for `m4_require'.  A macro must be m4_defun'd if
# either it is m4_require'd, or it m4_require's.
#
# Two things deserve attention and are detailed below:
#  1. Implementation of m4_require
#  2. Keeping track of the expansion stack
#
# 1. Implementation of m4_require
# ===============================
#
# Of course m4_defun calls m4_provide, so that a macro which has
# been expanded is not expanded again when m4_require'd, but the
# difficult part is the proper expansion of macros when they are
# m4_require'd.
#
# The implementation is based on three ideas, (i) using diversions to
# prepare the expansion of the macro and its dependencies (by Franc,ois
# Pinard), (ii) expand the most recently m4_require'd macros _after_
# the previous macros (by Axel Thimm), and (iii) track instances of
# provide before require (by Eric Blake).
#
#
# The first idea: why use diversions?
# -----------------------------------
#
# When a macro requires another, the other macro is expanded in new
# diversion, GROW.  When the outer macro is fully expanded, we first
# undivert the most nested diversions (GROW - 1...), and finally
# undivert GROW.  To understand why we need several diversions,
# consider the following example:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST1], [Test...m4_require([TEST2])1])
# | m4_defun([TEST2], [Test...m4_require([TEST3])2])
# | m4_defun([TEST3], [Test...3])
#
# Because m4_require is not required to be first in the outer macros, we
# must keep the expansions of the various levels of m4_require separated.
# Right before executing the epilogue of TEST1, we have:
#
#	   GROW - 2: Test...3
#	   GROW - 1: Test...2
#	   GROW:     Test...1
#	   BODY:
#
# Finally the epilogue of TEST1 undiverts GROW - 2, GROW - 1, and
# GROW into the regular flow, BODY.
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:
#	   BODY:        Test...3; Test...2; Test...1
#
# (The semicolons are here for clarification, but of course are not
# emitted.)  This is what Autoconf 2.0 (I think) to 2.13 (I'm sure)
# implement.
#
#
# The second idea: first required first out
# -----------------------------------------
#
# The natural implementation of the idea above is buggy and produces
# very surprising results in some situations.  Let's consider the
# following example to explain the bug:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST1],  [m4_require([TEST2a])m4_require([TEST2b])])
# | m4_defun([TEST2a], [])
# | m4_defun([TEST2b], [m4_require([TEST3])])
# | m4_defun([TEST3],  [m4_require([TEST2a])])
# |
# | AC_INIT
# | TEST1
#
# The dependencies between the macros are:
#
#		 3 --- 2b
#		/        \              is m4_require'd by
#	       /          \       left -------------------- right
#	    2a ------------ 1
#
# If you strictly apply the rules given in the previous section you get:
#
#	   GROW - 2: TEST3
#	   GROW - 1: TEST2a; TEST2b
#	   GROW:     TEST1
#	   BODY:
#
# (TEST2a, although required by TEST3 is not expanded in GROW - 3
# because is has already been expanded before in GROW - 1, so it has
# been AC_PROVIDE'd, so it is not expanded again) so when you undivert
# the stack of diversions, you get:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:
#	   BODY:        TEST3; TEST2a; TEST2b; TEST1
#
# i.e., TEST2a is expanded after TEST3 although the latter required the
# former.
#
# Starting from 2.50, we use an implementation provided by Axel Thimm.
# The idea is simple: the order in which macros are emitted must be the
# same as the one in which macros are expanded.  (The bug above can
# indeed be described as: a macro has been m4_provide'd before its
# dependent, but it is emitted after: the lack of correlation between
# emission and expansion order is guilty).
#
# How to do that?  You keep the stack of diversions to elaborate the
# macros, but each time a macro is fully expanded, emit it immediately.
#
# In the example above, when TEST2a is expanded, but it's epilogue is
# not run yet, you have:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1: TEST2a
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:
#
# The epilogue of TEST2a emits it immediately:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:     TEST2a
#
# TEST2b then requires TEST3, so right before the epilogue of TEST3, you
# have:
#
#	   GROW - 2: TEST3
#	   GROW - 1: Elaboration of TEST2b
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:      TEST2a
#
# The epilogue of TEST3 emits it:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1: Elaboration of TEST2b
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:     TEST2a; TEST3
#
# TEST2b is now completely expanded, and emitted:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:     Elaboration of TEST1
#	   BODY:     TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b
#
# and finally, TEST1 is finished and emitted:
#
#	   GROW - 2:
#	   GROW - 1:
#	   GROW:
#	   BODY:     TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b: TEST1
#
# The idea is simple, but the implementation is a bit involved.  If
# you are like me, you will want to see the actual functioning of this
# implementation to be convinced.  The next section gives the full
# details.
#
#
# The Axel Thimm implementation at work
# -------------------------------------
#
# We consider the macros above, and this configure.ac:
#
#	    AC_INIT
#	    TEST1
#
# You should keep the definitions of _m4_defun_pro, _m4_defun_epi, and
# m4_require at hand to follow the steps.
#
# This implementation tries not to assume that the current diversion is
# BODY, so as soon as a macro (m4_defun'd) is expanded, we first
# record the current diversion under the name _m4_divert_dump (denoted
# DUMP below for short).  This introduces an important difference with
# the previous versions of Autoconf: you cannot use m4_require if you
# are not inside an m4_defun'd macro, and especially, you cannot
# m4_require directly from the top level.
#
# We have not tried to simulate the old behavior (better yet, we
# diagnose it), because it is too dangerous: a macro m4_require'd from
# the top level is expanded before the body of `configure', i.e., before
# any other test was run.  I let you imagine the result of requiring
# AC_STDC_HEADERS for instance, before AC_PROG_CC was actually run....
#
# After AC_INIT was run, the current diversion is BODY.
# * AC_INIT was run
#   DUMP:                undefined
#   diversion stack:     BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 is expanded
# The prologue of TEST1 sets _m4_divert_dump, which is the diversion
# where the current elaboration will be dumped, to the current
# diversion.  It also m4_divert_push to GROW, where the full
# expansion of TEST1 and its dependencies will be elaborated.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        empty
#   diversions:  GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 requires TEST2a
# _m4_require_call m4_divert_pushes another temporary diversion,
# GROW - 1, and expands TEST2a in there.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        empty
#   GROW - 1:    TEST2a
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
# Then the content of the temporary diversion is moved to DUMP and the
# temporary diversion is popped.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a
#   diversions:  GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 requires TEST2b
# Again, _m4_require_call pushes GROW - 1 and heads to expand TEST2b.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST2b requires TEST3
# _m4_require_call pushes GROW - 2 and expands TEST3 here.
# (TEST3 requires TEST2a, but TEST2a has already been m4_provide'd, so
# nothing happens.)
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a
#   GROW - 2:    TEST3
#   diversions:  GROW - 2, GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
# Then the diversion is appended to DUMP, and popped.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 requires TEST2b (contd.)
# The content of TEST2b is expanded...
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3
#   GROW - 1:    TEST2b,
#   diversions:  GROW - 1, GROW, BODY |-
# ... and moved to DUMP.
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b
#   diversions:  GROW, BODY |-
#
# * TEST1 is expanded: epilogue
# TEST1's own content is in GROW...
#   DUMP:        BODY
#   BODY:        TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b
#   GROW:        TEST1
#   diversions:  BODY |-
# ... and it's epilogue moves it to DUMP and then undefines DUMP.
#   DUMP:       undefined
#   BODY:       TEST2a; TEST3; TEST2b; TEST1
#   diversions: BODY |-
#
#
# The third idea: track macros provided before they were required
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Using just the first two ideas, Autoconf 2.50 through 2.63 still had
# a subtle bug for more than seven years.  Let's consider the
# following example to explain the bug:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST1], [1])
# | m4_defun([TEST2], [2[]m4_require([TEST1])])
# | m4_defun([TEST3], [3 TEST1 m4_require([TEST2])])
# | TEST3
#
# After the prologue of TEST3, we are collecting text in GROW with the
# intent of dumping it in BODY during the epilogue.  Next, we
# encounter the direct invocation of TEST1, which provides the macro
# in place in GROW.  From there, we encounter a requirement for TEST2,
# which must be collected in a new diversion.  While expanding TEST2,
# we encounter a requirement for TEST1, but since it has already been
# expanded, the Axel Thimm algorithm states that we can treat it as a
# no-op.  But that would lead to an end result of `2 3 1', meaning
# that we have once again output a macro (TEST2) prior to its
# requirements (TEST1).
#
# The problem can only occur if a single defun'd macro first provides,
# then later indirectly requires, the same macro.  Note that directly
# expanding then requiring a macro is okay: because the dependency was
# met, the require phase can be a no-op.  For that matter, the outer
# macro can even require two helpers, where the first helper expands
# the macro, and the second helper indirectly requires the macro.
# Out-of-order expansion is only present if the inner macro is
# required by something that will be hoisted in front of where the
# direct expansion occurred.  In other words, we must be careful not
# to warn on:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST4], [4])
# | m4_defun([TEST5], [5 TEST4 m4_require([TEST4])])
# | TEST5 => 5 4
#
# or even the more complex:
#
# | m4_defun([TEST6], [6])
# | m4_defun([TEST7], [7 TEST6])
# | m4_defun([TEST8], [8 m4_require([TEST6])])
# | m4_defun([TEST9], [9 m4_require([TEST8])])
# | m4_defun([TEST10], [10 m4_require([TEST7]) m4_require([TEST9])])
# | TEST10 => 7 6 8 9 10
#
# So, to detect whether a require was direct or indirect, m4_defun and
# m4_require track the name of the macro that caused a diversion to be
# created (using the stack _m4_diverting, coupled with an O(1) lookup
# _m4_diverting([NAME])), and m4_provide stores the name associated
# with the diversion at which a macro was provided.  A require call is
# direct if it occurs within the same diversion where the macro was
# provided, or if the diversion associated with the providing context
# has been collected.
#
# The implementation of the warning involves tracking the set of
# macros which have been provided since the start of the outermost
# defun'd macro (the set is named _m4_provide).  When starting an
# outermost macro, the set is emptied; when a macro is provided, it is
# added to the set; when require expands the body of a macro, it is
# removed from the set; and when a macro is indirectly required, the
# set is checked.  If a macro is in the set, then it has been provided
# before it was required, and we satisfy dependencies by expanding the
# macro as if it had never been provided; in the example given above,
# this means we now output `1 2 3 1'.  Meanwhile, a warning is issued
# to inform the user that her macros trigger the bug in older autoconf
# versions, and that her output file now contains redundant contents
# (and possibly new problems, if the repeated macro was not
# idempotent).  Meanwhile, macros defined by m4_defun_once instead of
# m4_defun are idempotent, avoiding any warning or duplicate output.
#
#
# 2. Keeping track of the expansion stack
# =======================================
#
# When M4 expansion goes wrong it is often extremely hard to find the
# path amongst macros that drove to the failure.  What is needed is
# the stack of macro `calls'. One could imagine that GNU M4 would
# maintain a stack of macro expansions, unfortunately it doesn't, so
# we do it by hand.  This is of course extremely costly, but the help
# this stack provides is worth it.  Nevertheless to limit the
# performance penalty this is implemented only for m4_defun'd macros,
# not for define'd macros.
#
# Each time we enter an m4_defun'd macros, we add a definition in
# _m4_expansion_stack, and when we exit the macro, we remove it (thanks
# to pushdef/popdef).  m4_stack_foreach is used to print the expansion
# stack in the rare cases when it's needed.
#
# In addition, we want to detect circular m4_require dependencies.
# Each time we expand a macro FOO we define _m4_expanding(FOO); and
# m4_require(BAR) simply checks whether _m4_expanding(BAR) is defined.


# m4_expansion_stack
# ------------------
# Expands to the entire contents of the expansion stack.  The caller
# must supply a trailing newline.  This macro always prints a
# location; check whether _m4_expansion_stack is defined to filter out
# the case when no defun'd macro is in force.

#
# The normal cases are:

#     m4_require([AC_PROG_CC], [AC_PROG_CC])

#
# - BODY-TO-EXPAND == m4_indir([NAME-TO-CHECK])
#   In the case of macros with irregular names.  For instance:
#     m4_require([AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)], [indir([AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)])])

#   call it.'
#   Had you used

#
#   You could argue that `AC_LANG_COMPILER', when it receives an argument
#   such as `C' should dispatch the call to `AC_LANG_COMPILER(C)'.  But this

#
# Then notice the second pattern: it is in charge of removing the

# it costs O(n) to search the string for each of O(n) insertions; not
# to mention that with m4 1.4.x, even using m4_append is slow, costing
# O(n) rather than O(1) per insertion.  Other set operations, not used
# by Autoconf but still possible by manipulation of the definition
# tracked in macro NAME, include O(n) deletion of one element and O(n)
# computation of set size.  Because the set is exposed to the user via
# the definition of a single macro, we cannot cache any data about the
# set without risking the cache being invalidated by the user
# redefining NAME.
#
# Can we do better?  Yes, because m4 gives us an O(1) search function
# for free: ifdef.  Additionally, even m4 1.4.x gives us an O(1)
# insert operation for free: pushdef.  But to use these, we must
# represent the set via a group of macros; to keep the set consistent,
# we must hide the set so that the user can only manipulate it through
# accessor macros.  The contents of the set are maintained through two
# access points; _m4_set([name]) is a pushdef stack of values in the
# set, useful for O(n) traversal of the set contents; while the
# existence of _m4_set([name],value) with no particular value is
# useful for O(1) querying of set membership.  And since the user
# cannot externally manipulate the set, we are free to add additional
# caching macros for other performance improvements.  Deletion can be
# O(1) per element rather than O(n), by reworking the definition of
# _m4_set([name],value) to be 0 or 1 based on current membership, and
# adding _m4_set_cleanup(name) to defer the O(n) cleanup of
# _m4_set([name]) until we have another reason to do an O(n)
# traversal.  The existence of _m4_set_cleanup(name) can then be used
# elsewhere to determine if we must dereference _m4_set([name],value),
# or assume that definition implies set membership.  Finally, size can
# be tracked in an O(1) fashion with _m4_set_size(name).
#
# The quoting in _m4_set([name],value) is chosen so that there is no
# ambiguity with a set whose name contains a comma, and so that we can
# supply the value via _m4_defn([_m4_set([name])]) without needing any
# quote manipulation.
