Description:
base::numerics is a library for doing some simple safe math and conversions.
base::MRUCache is a few collections of most-recently-used caching structures.
base::SHA1 is a secure hashing algorithm.

To update the checkout, simply overwrite the folder with Chromium's latest, apply
the appropriate namespace, and make sure the paths are correct (anglebase/ instead of
base/), and update the header guards and macros.

Modifications:

- the file scope is now anglebase/ from base/ to prevent include conflicts.
- anglebase/logging.h defines (D)CHECK to be ASSERT to be compatible with ANGLE.
- the headers use namespace angle::base instead of base:: to avoid ODR
  violations when ANGLE code is mixed with Chromium code.
- header guards and macros are changed from BASE to ANGLEBASE to prevent conflicts.
