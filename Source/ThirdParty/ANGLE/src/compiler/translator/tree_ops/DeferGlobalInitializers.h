// DeferGlobalInitializers is an AST traverser that moves global initializers into a separate
// function that is called in the beginning of main(). This enables initialization of globals with
// uniforms or non-constant globals, as allowed by the WebGL spec. Some initializers referencing
// non-constants may need to be unfolded into if statements in HLSL - this kind of steps should be
// done after DeferGlobalInitializers is run. Note that it's important that the function definition
// is at the end of the shader, as some globals may be declared after main().
//
// It can also initialize all uninitialized globals.
