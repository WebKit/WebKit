# ANGLE - Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine

The goal of ANGLE is to allow users of multiple operating systems to seamlessly run WebGL and other
OpenGL ES content by translating OpenGL ES API calls to one of the hardware-supported APIs available
for that platform. ANGLE currently provides translation from OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0 to desktop
OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D 9, and Direct3D 11. Support for translation from OpenGL ES to Vulkan is
underway, and future plans include compute shader support (ES 3.1) and MacOS support.

ANGLE v1.0.772 was certified compliant by passing the ES 2.0.3 conformance tests in October 2011.
ANGLE also provides an implementation of the EGL 1.4 specification.

ANGLE is used as the default WebGL backend for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on Windows
platforms. Chrome uses ANGLE for all graphics rendering on Windows, including the accelerated
Canvas2D implementation and the Native Client sandbox environment.

Portions of the ANGLE shader compiler are used as a shader validator and translator by WebGL
implementations across multiple platforms. It is used on Mac OS X, Linux, and in mobile variants of
the browsers. Having one shader validator helps to ensure that a consistent set of GLSL ES shaders
are accepted across browsers and platforms. The shader translator can be used to translate shaders
to other shading languages, and to optionally apply shader modifications to work around bugs or
quirks in the native graphics drivers. The translator targets Desktop GLSL, Direct3D HLSL, and even
ESSL for native GLES2 platforms.
