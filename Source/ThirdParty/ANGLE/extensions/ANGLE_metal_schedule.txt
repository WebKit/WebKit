Overview

    This extension provides a way to ensure that all queued operations currently
    in the pipeline have had their resources readied and are waiting for the GPU
    to process them.

    The motivation is to allow for the interoperation with multiple APIs through
    shared resources, where the system needs to observe the dependencies to
    sequence operations correctly. Currently, Finish() is required to ensure
    these dependencies are met where Schedule() would suffice.
 
New Procedures and Functions

        void ScheduleANGLE(void);
