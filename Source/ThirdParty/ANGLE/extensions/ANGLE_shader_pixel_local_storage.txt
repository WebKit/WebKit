    OpenGL ES Extension XX

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 3.0 and GLSL ES 3.00 are required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 3.0 specification and the
    OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.00 specification.

    This extension interacts with GL_OES_sample_variables.

    This extension interacts with OpenGL ES 3.1.

    This extension interacts with GLSL ES 3.10.

Overview

    A major feature missing from WebGL is the ability to access rendering
    results from fragment shaders and perform tasks like programmable blending.
    This is especially desirable on Tile-Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR)
    architectures, as it can be implemented entirely on-chip to achieve maximum
    performance.

    Capabilities in this area vary widely, but it is the case that all major GPU
    vendors, on all major APIs, have some mechanism, direct or indirect, whereby
    a fragment shader can access prior rendering results. The intent of this
    extension is to condense this myriad of hardware and API features into a
    simple interface with straightforward implementation(s) on every graphics
    API.

    Similar to EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage, this extension provides a means
    for fragment shaders to load and store user-defined data associated with the
    pixel being covered. The data is accessed via GLSL built-in functions
    pixelLocalLoadANGLE() and pixelLocalStoreANGLE(). Only the current pixel's
    data can be accessed; data associated with other pixels is not accessible to
    the fragment shader. Pixel local storage persists across all fragment
    invocations and across all draws issued between OpenGL ES API calls
    BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE() and EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE(), even if the
    application binds different shader programs.

    Applications define custom, formatted planes of pixel local storage data, up
    to an implementation-dependent maximum, using the OpenGL ES API functions
    FramebufferMemorylessPixelLocalStorageANGLE() and
    FramebufferTexturePixelLocalStorageANGLE(). These methods behave similarly
    to FramebufferTextureLayer(). Fragment shaders access a specific local
    storage plane using one of the opaque GLSL types {pixelLocalANGLE,
    ipixelLocalANGLE, upixelLocalANGLE}, which are analogous to samplers or
    images.

    This extension provides two different extension string entries:

        - GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage: Provides the new pixel local
          storage functionality, but each pixel may only be touched once in any
          single rendering pass. The command PixelLocalStorageBarrierANGLE() is
          provided to indicate a boundary between passes. Rendering the same
          pixel twice without a barrier can yield incorrect results. However,
          "incorrect" does _not_ mean they can be random, uninitialized, or
          leaked from outside the current draw framebuffer; any artifacts are
          strictly a result of race conditions between overlapping fragment
          invocations involved in the current rendering pass.

        - GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage_coherent: Guarantees that pixel
          local storage operations touching the same pixel are invoked
          synchronously and in API primitive order. No barriers are required and
          render passes can emit overlapping fragments.

    Some implementations may support GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage without
    supporting GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage_coherent.

    A note on performance: On some platforms, this feature will be polyfilled
    with shader images. While every implementation can be expected to run
    reasonably fast, certain platforms may see some performance degradation at
    times from using pixel local storage instead of the normal raster pipeline.
    As always, benchmark and consider other options before using pixel local
    storage.

  Modify Chapter 2 "OpenGL ES Operation"

  (Insert a new numbered section before 2.14 "Asynchronous Queries".)

  Section 2.X "Pixel Local Storage"

    Pixel local storage provides a means for fragment shaders to load and store
    user-defined data associated with the pixel being covered. Pixel local
    storage is configured on a framebuffer as described in Section 4.4.2.X
    "Configuring Pixel Local Storage on a Framebuffer". Fragment shaders may
    access pixel local storage data as described in OpenGL ES Shading Language
    Specification.

    Pixel local storage is activated and deactivated for the current draw
    framebuffer using the commands:

      void BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE(sizei planes, const enum loadops[])
      void EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE()

    Parameters:

      * <planes> specifies the number of pixel local storage planes to activate.
                 Specifically, the pixel local storage planes indexed in the
                 range [0, planes - 1] on the current draw framebuffer will be
                 activated.

      * <loadops> specifies an array of pixel local storage "Load Operations",
                  whose length is equal to <planes>, and whose ith element
                  describes the Load Operation to perform on the ith pixel local
                  storage plane. Possible Load Operations are listed in Table
                  X.1.

        Load Operation    Description
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        ZERO              Clear all components of the pixel local storage
                          plane to 0. This is recommended over CLEAR_ANGLE, as
                          it is more likely to be performant on all
                          implementations.

        CLEAR_ANGLE       Clear the pixel local storage plane to its
                          framebuffer's ith clear value of corresponding type.
                          Pixel local clear values are specified with
                          FramebufferPixelLocalClearValue{f,i,ui}vANGLE(), as
                          described in section 4.4.2.Y "Pixel Local Clear
                          State".

        KEEP              Load the contents of the bound texture layer image
                          into pixel local storage. This Load Operation is
                          only valid for pixel local storage planes that have
                          a texture binding. Texture bindings are established
                          with FramebufferTexturePixelLocalStorageANGLE() as
                          described in section 4.4.2.X "Configuring Pixel
                          Local Storage on a Framebuffer".

        DONT_CARE         Leave the initial contents of the pixel local storage
                          plane undefined, favoring speed, and with the caveat
                          that they are _not_ leaked from outside the current
                          draw framebuffer.

        DISABLE_ANGLE     Leave this plane disabled.

                          Note that all pixel local storage planes on or after
                          index <planes> are disabled implicitly.

        Table X.1: Pixel local storage Load Operations.

    Errors generated by BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE():

      * INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION is generated if the default framebuffer
        object name 0 is bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if
        <planes> < 1 or <planes> > MAX_PIXEL_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLANES_ANGLE

      * INVALID_ENUM is generated if <loadops>[0..<planes>-1] is not one of the
        Load Operations enumerated in Table X.1

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <loadops>[0..<planes>-1] is KEEP and
        the pixel local storage plane at that same index is memoryless

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <loadops>[0..<planes>-1] is not
        DISABLE_ANGLE, and the pixel local storage plane at that same index is
        is in a deinitialized state

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 1
        (i.e., if multisampling is enabled)

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a single texture layer image is bound
        to more than one active pixel local storage plane

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a single texture layer image is bound
        to an active pixel local storage plane, and at the same time attached to
        a color attachment whose associated draw buffer is not NONE (i.e, a
        single texture cannot be bound to pixel local storage and rendered into
        at the same time)

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if any active, texture-backed pixel local
        storage planes and/or color attachments enabled for rendering have
        differing dimensions

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if pixel local storage is already active

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a draw buffer is not NONE on or after

          COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 +
          MAX_COMBINED_DRAW_BUFFERS_AND_PLS_PLANES_ANGLE - <planes>

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a texture or sampler is bound to a
        texture unit on or after

          TEXTURE0 +
          MAX_COMBINED_PROGRAM_TEXTURES_AND_PLS_PLANES_ANGLE - <planes>

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if DITHER is enabled

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if RASTERIZER_DISCARD is enabled

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE is enabled

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if SAMPLE_COVERAGE is enabled

    Errors generated by EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE():

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if pixel local storage is not active

    After a successful call to BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE(), the specified
    pixel local storage planes are active, fully initialized, and available for
    fragment shaders to read and write. This data will persist across all
    fragment invocations and across all draws issued until the application calls
    EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE(), even if the application binds different shader
    programs. In order to make this guarantee, the the OpenGL ES API only allows
    a very limited set of commands while pixel local storage is active. All
    other commands generate INVALID_OPERATION. Valid commands while pixel local
    storage is active include:

      * ActiveTexture()
      * BindBuffer(), BindBufferBase(), BindBufferRange(), BindSampler(),
        BindTexture(), BindVertexArray()
      * Blend*(),
      * CheckFramebufferStatus()
      * ClearBufferfi(), ClearBufferfv(), ClearBufferiv(), ClearBufferuiv()
      * ColorMask()
      * CullFace()
      * DrawArrays*() (incuding extensions)
      * DrawElements*() (incuding extensions)
      * DrawRangeElements()
      * Enable(), Disable() with limited caps:
          BLEND, CULL_FACE, DEPTH_TEST, POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL,
          PRIMITIVE_RESTART_FIXED_INDEX, SCISSOR_TEST, STENCIL_TEST
      * EnableVertexAttribArray(), DisableVertexAttribArray()
      * FrontFace()
      * Get*()
      * Hint()
      * Is*()
      * LineWidth()
      * PolygonOffset()
      * SamplerParameter*()
      * Scissor()
      * Stencil*()
      * TexParameter*()
      * Uniform*()
      * UseProgram()
      * ValidateProgram()
      * VertexAttrib*()
      * Viewport()

    Additional restrictions also go into effect when pixel local storage is
    active:

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a draw is issued with a fragment
        shader that accesses a texture bound to pixel local storage

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a draw is issued with a fragment
        shader that has a uniform bound to an inactive pixel local storage plane

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a draw is issued with a fragment
        shader that does _not_ have a uniform bound to an _active_ pixel local
        storage plane (i.e., the fragment shader must declare uniforms bound to
        every single active pixel local storage plane)

        This facilitates implementations where the pixel local storage structure
        must be declared in the shader, e.g., EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a draw is issued with a fragment
        shader that has a pixel local storage uniform whose format layout
        qualifier does not identically match the internalformat of its
        associated pixel local storage plane on the current draw framebuffer, as
        enumerated in Table X.2.

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the application attempts to bind a
        texture or sampler to a texture unit or or after

          TEXTURE0 +
          MAX_COMBINED_PROGRAM_TEXTURES_AND_PLS_PLANES_ANGLE - <planes>

        where <planes> is the value that was passed to
        BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE()

    Because of the "implementation-dependent" clause of the framebuffer
    completeness test, and because a pixel local storage implementation may add
    additional attachments to the underlying framebuffer object, it is strongly
    advised that an application also check to see if the framebuffer is complete
    after BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE() and prior to rendering. (See section
    4.4.4.2 "Whole Framebuffer Completeness".)

    If BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE() generates an error, pixel local storage is
    still considered active and the application must still balance it with a
    call to EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE(). However, any draws issued during this
    time generate an INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error.

    When pixel local storage is inactive, any draw issued with a fragment shader
    that declares pixel local storage uniforms generates an
    INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error.

  Section 2.X.1 "Non-coherent Pixel Local Storage"

    When GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage_coherent is _not_ supported, and
    pixel local storage is active, applications must also split their rendering
    of pixel local storage into separate passes, none of which touch an
    individual pixel more than once. The command:

      void PixelLocalStorageBarrierANGLE()

    delimits a boundary between distinct, non-self-overlapping rendering passes.
    Pixel local storage loads issued after the barrier will reflect stores
    issued prior to the barrier, and stores issued after the barrier will not
    execute until all accesses initiated prior to the barrier are complete.

    Rendering to the same pixel more than once without a barrier in between can
    yield incorrect results in pixel local storage, however, "incorrect" does
    _not_ mean they can be random, uninitialized, or leaked from outside the
    current draw framebuffer. Any artifacts are strictly a result of race
    conditions between overlapping fragment invocations involved in the current
    rendering pass.

  Modify Section 4.4.2 "Attaching Images to Framebuffer Objects"

  (Insert two new numbered section after 4.4.2.3 "Attaching Texture Images to a
   Framebuffer".)

  Section 4.4.2.X "Configuring Pixel Local Storage on a Framebuffer"

    The GL provides an array of configurable pixel local storage planes on
    framebuffer objects. These planes are numbered beginning with zero, with the
    total number of pixel local storage planes provided given by the
    implementation-dependent constant MAX_PIXEL_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLANES_ANGLE.
    Fragment shaders may access pixel local storage data as described in OpenGL
    ES Shading Language Specification. Initially, pixel local storage planes are
    in a deinitialized state and are unusable.

    A memoryless pixel local storage plane may be established on the current
    draw framebuffer by calling:

      void FramebufferMemorylessPixelLocalStorageANGLE(int plane,
                                                       enum internalformat)

    Parameters:

      * <plane> identifies the pixel local storage plane index

      * <internalformat> selects the data format, as enumerated in Table X.2

        internalformat    format qualifier    Pixel Local Type
        ------------------------------------------------------
        RGBA8             rgba8               pixelLocalANGLE
        RGBA8I            rgba8i              ipixelLocalANGLE
        RGBA8UI           rgba8ui             upixelLocalANGLE
        R32F              r32f                pixelLocalANGLE
        R32UI             r32ui               upixelLocalANGLE

        Table X.2: Supported pixel local storage internalformats, with their
        required corresponding GLSL format layout qualifier and Pixel Local
        Type.

        Note that all pixel local storage formats consume exactly 4 bytes of
        storage.

        Note that r32i is excluded from this table because it is not supported
        by EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage.

    Errors:

      * INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION is generated if the default framebuffer
        object name 0 is bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if
        <plane> < 0 or <plane> >= MAX_PIXEL_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLANES_ANGLE

      * INVALID_ENUM is generated if <internalformat> is not one of the
        acceptable values in Table X.2, or NONE

    If <internalformat> is NONE, the pixel local storage plane at index <plane>
    is deinitialized and any internal storage is released.

    Otherwise, this call establishes a formatted plane of pixel local storage
    data at index <plane>, accessible exclusively to fragment shaders, whose
    liftetime will be scoped between calls to BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE() and
    EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE(). The pixel local storage plane is "memoryless"
    from the application's perspective. Its contents are cleared upon calling
    BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE(), and its contents are lost after the
    application calls EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE(). The implementation will make
    a best effort to store this data exclusively in high performance local
    caches, e.g., tiled memory, but accessing the data may still result in
    memory transactions on some platforms.

    Additionally, the GL supports binding a layer of an immutable texture object
    to pixel local storage. In this scenario, the pixel local storage data is
    not lost upon calling EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE(), but rather, will be
    stored in the given texture layer image. Such behavior is useful for
    applications such as blending in the fragment shader, where the application
    renders to pixel local storage instead of a color attachment.

    When a texture layer image is bound to pixel local storage, the application
    may also choose to initialize the pixel local storage plane using its bound
    texture image contents during BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE().

    An immutable texture layer may be bound to a pixel local storage plane on
    the current draw framebuffer by calling:

      void FramebufferTexturePixelLocalStorageANGLE(int plane,
                                                    uint backingtexture,
                                                    int level,
                                                    int layer)

    Parameters:

      * <plane> identifies the pixel local storage plane index

      * <backingtexture> specifies the name of an existing immutable texture
                         object to bind

    Errors:

      * INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION is generated if the default framebuffer
        object name 0 is bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if
        <plane> < 0 or <plane> >= MAX_PIXEL_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLANES_ANGLE

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <backingtexture> is not the name of an
        existing immutable texture object

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <backingtexture> is not of type
        GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, or
        GL_TEXTURE_3D

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the internalformat of <backingtexture> is
        not one of the acceptable values in Table X.2

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if <level> < 0

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <level> >= the immutable number of
        mipmap levels in <backingtexture>

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if <layer> < 0

      * INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <layer> >= the immutable number of
        texture layers in <backingtexture>

    If <backingtexture> is 0, <level> and <layer> are ignored and the pixel
    local storage plane <plane> is deinitialized.

    Otherwise, this call establishes a formatted plane of pixel local storage
    data at index <plane>, whose contents are bound to the given texture layer
    image.

    If a texture object is deleted while one or more if its layers is bound to a
    pixel local storage plane on the currently bound draw framebuffer, then each
    plane to which a layer was bound on that framebuffer is deinitialized. Note
    that pixel local storage planes are not deinitialized on any other
    framebuffer objects. Unbinding the texture layers from other framebuffer
    objects is the responsibility of the application, and their underlying
    memory will not be released until the application does so.

  Section 4.4.2.Y "Pixel Local Clear State"

    Each pixel local storage plane on a framebuffer has state for three separate
    clear values: a 4-component vector of type FLOAT, INT, and UNSIGNED_INT. A
    pixel local storage plane is cleared to the value whose type corresponds to
    its internalformat when the Load Operation CLEAR_ANGLE is executed. The
    commands:

      void FramebufferPixelLocalClearValuefvANGLE(GLint plane,
                                                  const float value[4])

      void FramebufferPixelLocalClearValueivANGLE(GLint plane,
                                                  const int value[4])

      void FramebufferPixelLocalClearValueuivANGLE(GLint plane,
                                                   const uint value[4])

    Parameters:

      * <plane> identifies the pixel local storage plane index

      * <value> specifies the new 4-component clear value

    Errors:

      * INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION is generated if the default framebuffer
        object name 0 is bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if
        <plane> < 0 or <plane> >= MAX_PIXEL_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLANES_ANGLE

    set the clear value state for a specific plane of pixel local storage on the
    current draw framebuffer.

  Modify Section 6.1 "Querying GL State"

  (Insert a new numbered section after 6.1.14 "Renderbuffer Object Queries".)

  Section 6.1.X "Pixel Local Storage Queries"

    To query the state of a pixel local storage plane on the current
    draw famebuffer, the application may call GetIntegeri_v() with <index> set
    to the desired pixel local storage plane index and <target> set to
    PIXEL_LOCAL_FORMAT_ANGLE, PIXEL_LOCAL_TEXTURE_NAME_ANGLE,
    PIXEL_LOCAL_TEXTURE_LEVEL_ANGLE, or PIXEL_LOCAL_TEXTURE_LAYER_ANGLE.

      * If <pname> is PIXEL_LOCAL_FORMAT_ANGLE, <params> will contain the
        internalformat of the plane from Table X.2, or NONE if the selected
        pixel local storage plane is in a deinitialized state.

      * If <pname> is PIXEL_LOCAL_TEXTURE_NAME_ANGLE, <params> will contain the
        name of the immutable texture object which contains the image layer
        bound to the plane, or 0 if no texture is bound.

        Note that if the attached texture was deleted while the current draw
        framebuffer was unbound, <params> will be undefined (See section 4.4.2.X
        "Configuring Pixel Local Storage on a Framebuffer".)

      * If <pname> is PIXEL_LOCAL_TEXTURE_LEVEL_ANGLE, <params> will contain the
        mipmap level of the bound texture object, or -1 if no texture is bound.

      * If <pname> is PIXEL_LOCAL_TEXTURE_LAYER_ANGLE, <params> will contain the
        layer of the bound texture object, or -1 if no texture is bound.

    Errors:

      * INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION is generated if the default framebuffer
        object name 0 is bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER

      * INVALID_VALUE is generated if
        <plane> < 0 or <plane> >= MAX_PIXEL_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLANES_ANGLE

Additions to the OpenGL ES Shading Language Specification, Version 3.00

    Including the following line in a fragment shader controls the language
    features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage : <behavior>

    Where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.5.

    Whether or not the application relies on the "_coherent" extension string
    from the OpenGL ES API side, the language features described in this section
    are identical, and fragment shaders should only enable
    GL_ANGLE_shader_pixel_local_storage.

  Modify Section 4.1 "Basic Types"

    (Add the following new types.)

    Pixel Local Types (opaque)

      * pixelLocalANGLE
          a handle for accessing floating-point pixel local storage data

      * ipixelLocalANGLE
          a handle for accessing integer pixel local storage data

      * upixelLocalANGLE
          a handle for accessing unsigned integer pixel local storage data

  Modify Section 4.1.7 "Opaque Types"

  (Insert a new numbered section after 4.1.7.1 "Samplers".)

  Section 4.1.7.X "Pixel Local Storage"

    Pixel local types (e.g. pixelLocalANGLE) are opaque types. They are handles
    for accessing user-defined data that is associated with the pixel being
    covered. They are used with the built-in functions described in section 8.X
    "Pixel Local Storage Functions".

    In addition to the limitations already imposed on opaque types, pixel local
    types are subject to additional constraints:

      * They cannot be aggregated in arrays.

      * As uniforms, they must be declared at global scope; they cannot be
        declared in structs or interface blocks.

      * As uniforms, they are not visible to the OpenGL ES API and cannot be
        accessed via GetUniformLocation() or GetActiveUniform(). (This
        facilitates backends that are implemented entirely in-shader, e.g.,
        EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage.)

      * As uniforms, they must declare "binding" and "format" layout qualifiers,
        as described in section 4.3.8.X "Pixel Local Storage Layout Qualifiers".

      * As function arguments, they cannot have layout qualifiers. Any function
        that accepts pixel local type(s) as arguments is inlined by the compiler,
        and the bindings and formats are determined at the call site.

      * They cannot be aliased; it is a compile-time error to declare two pixel
        local uniforms with duplicate binding layout qualifiers.

      * They can only be declared in a fragment shader.

    Fragment shaders that declare pixel local storage uniforms are subject to
    additional shader-wide restrictions as well:

      * discard is illegal

          When polyfilled with shader images, pixel local storage requires
          early_fragment_tests, which causes discard to interact differently
          with the depth and stencil tests.

          In order to ensure identical behavior across all backends (some of
          which may not have access to early_fragment_tests), we disallow
          discard if pixel local storage uniforms have been declared.

      * return from main() is illegal

          ARB_fragment_shader_interlock functions cannot be called within flow
          control, which includes any code that might execute after a return
          statement. To keep things simple, and since these "interlock" calls
          are automatically generated by the compiler inside of main(), we
          disallow return from main() if pixel local storage uniforms have been
          declared.

      * assignment to gl_FragDepth(EXT) or gl_SampleMask is illegal

          When polyfilled with shader images, pixel local storage requires
          early_fragment_tests, which causes assignments to gl_FragDepth(EXT)
          and gl_SampleMask to be ignored.

          In order to ensure identical behavior across all backends, we disallow
          assignment to these values if pixel local storage uniforms have been
          declared.

    Shaders are also limited in the number of sampler and pixel local storage
    uniforms they can declare:

      * It is a compile-time error for a fragment shader to access more than
        MAX_COMBINED_FRAGMENT_TEXTURES_AND_PLS_PLANES_ANGLE textures and pixel
        local storage planes combined. If the fragment shader accesses the same
        texture image unit in two different samplers, that counts as using two
        texture image units against this limit.

      * It is a link-time error for a shader program to access more than
        MAX_COMBINED_PROGRAM_TEXTURES_AND_PLS_PLANES_ANGLE textures and pixel
        local storage planes combined. If both the vertex and fragment shaders
        access the same texture image unit, that counts as using two texture
        image units against this limit.

  Modify Section 4.3.8 "Layout Qualifiers"

  (Insert a new numbered section after 4.3.8.3 "Uniform Block Layout
   Qualifiers")

  Section 4.3.8.X "Pixel Local Storage Layout Qualifiers"

    The layout qualifier identifiers for pixel local storage types are:

      layout-qualifier-id
        binding = <integer-constant>
        <format>

    Accepable identifiers for <format> are enumerated in Table X.2.

    It is a compile-time error to declare a pixel local storage uniform that
    does not specify both of these layout qualifiers, or to specify a format
    layout qualifier on any type other than that format's corresponding "Pixel
    Local Type", as enumerated in Table X.2.

  Modify Section 8 "Built-in Functions"

  (Insert a new numbered section after 8.9 "Fragment Processing Functions".)

  Section 8.X "Pixel Local Storage Functions"

    The built-in functions defined in this section accept pixel local storage
    handles (abbreviated as "PLS handles") in order to load and store data
    associated with the pixel being covered.

    A reference to a specific PLS plane is established by indexing into the
    current draw framebuffer's PLS planes using the PLS handle's "binding"
    layout qualifier. If any PLS handle references an inactive PLS plane, or a
    PLS plane whose internalformat does not match the handle's format, the
    shader does not execute and a draw-time error is generated in the OpenGL ES
    API instead.

    Syntax:

      vec4 pixelLocalLoadANGLE(pixelLocalANGLE handle)
      ivec4 pixelLocalLoadANGLE(ipixelLocalANGLE handle)
      uvec4 pixelLocalLoadANGLE(upixelLocalANGLE handle)

    Description:

      Reads the current pixel's data from the PLS plane referenced by <handle>.

    Syntax:

      void pixelLocalStoreANGLE(pixelLocalANGLE handle, vec4 value)
      void pixelLocalStoreANGLE(ipixelLocalANGLE handle, ivec4 value)
      void pixelLocalStoreANGLE(upixelLocalANGLE handle, uvec4 value)

    Description:

      Replaces the current pixel's data with <value> in the PLS plane referenced
      by <handle>. If the magnitude of <value> is too large to be represented in
      the PLS format, it is clamped.

  Modify Section 9 "Shading Language Grammar"

    (Add the following tokens to the lexical analysis.)

    PIXELLOCALANGLE IPIXELLOCALANGLE UPIXELLOCALANGLE


Interactions with GLSL ES 3.10

    If GLSL ES 3.10 is supported, pixel local storage and images cannot be used
    in the same shader; it is a compile time error for a shader to declare both
    image uniforms and pixel local storage uniforms.

Issues

    (1) EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage has a clause that PLS contents become
    undefined if an application causes color data to be flushed to the
    framebuffer. Can we use this extension and still guarantee the security of
    WebGL?

      RESOLVED: We have confirmation that all mobile vendors guarantee there's
      no data leaked from outside the render pass. There can be data leaked from
      normal framebuffer attachments to PLS planes, but said attachments
      themselves are not shared between WebGL contexts, so should not be a
      security concern.

      Imagination gave the caveat that we must also initialize PLS data up front
      in order to not get left-over data from a previous render pass, but this
      is exactly what our API is designed to do via load operations. If
      EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage2 is supported, we can clear PLS using
      ClearPixelLocalStorageuiEXT(). Otherwise, we can clear or load PLS data
      from a texture by issuing a fullscreen draw.

      Additionally, if the browser uses virtual contexts and wishes to interrupt
      a PLS render pass, it must be sure to internally call
      EndPixelLocalStorageANGLE() before handing off control to the other
      virtual context, and BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE() again before returning
      control.

    (2) Depending on the implementation, <loadops> of ZERO and KEEP can have
    very different performance characteristics. Would a <loadop> of DONT_CARE,
    which makes the PLS contents undefined, be acceptable in WebGL?

      RESOLVED: From a security standpoint, the crucial aspect is that the data
      doesn't come from another context, and that needs to be specified. Similar
      decisions have been made previously in performance-critical areas of the
      spec.
