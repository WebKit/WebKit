Overview

    This extension enables the selection of a graphics device to back
    an ANGLE EGLDisplay.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <attrib_list> argument of
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_DEVICE_ID_HIGH_ANGLE          0x34D6
        EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_DEVICE_ID_LOW_ANGLE           0x34D7

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None

New Behavior

    To request a display that is backed by a specific graphics device,
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_DEVICE_ID_HIGH_ANGLE and/or
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_DEVICE_ID_LOW_ANGLE should be set to the high part and
    low part of the device's ID. If only one attribute is specified, the other
    is assumed to be zero. The device's ID is specific to the platform that
    ANGLE is running on, but should fit into one 64-bit value.

    If the high part and low part combined is zero, an EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE error
    is generated and EGL_NO_DISPLAY is returned.

    If the ID specified doesn't match any devices on the system, the device
    is selected as described in the EGL_ANGLE_display_power_preference extension.
