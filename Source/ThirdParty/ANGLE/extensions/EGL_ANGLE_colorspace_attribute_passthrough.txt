    EGL Extension ###

Dependencies

    Requires support for the following extension
        - EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_display_p3
        - EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_display_p3_linear
        - EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_display_p3_passthrough
        - EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_scrgb
        - EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_scrgb_linear
    Refer to the above specifications for indirect dependencies.

Overview

    On Android, the support for colorspace extensions listed above are determined
    based on -
    1. The EGL implementation supporting EGL_KHR_gl_colorspace extension
    2. Device's display supporting wide color gamut

    In such cases the Android EGL loader handles the implementation of the above
    extensions. However, vendors using ANGLE as their EGL/GLES implementations,
    which layers GLES APIs over Vulkan, need to know the value of these colorspace
    attributes in order to create Vulkan swapchain images or other images with the
    appropriate colorspace flags.

    This extension allows ANGLE's EGL implementation to rely on the Android EGL loader
    to support and implement the above extensions with the exception that ANGLE's EGL
    implementation will passthrough, without generating validation errors, the colorspace
    attribute values introduced by the extensions listed above, to the underlying Vulkan
    implementation.

    For details about colorspace and related terminology please refer to the extensions
    listed in the "Dependencies" section.
