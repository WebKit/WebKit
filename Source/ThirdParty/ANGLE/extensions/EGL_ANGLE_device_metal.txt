Number

    EGL Extension #XXX

Extension Type

    EGL device extension

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the language of EGL 1.5 as
    modified by EGL_EXT_device_query.

    EGL_EXT_device_query is required.

Overview

    ANGLE has the ability to run GPU commands on a metal device.
    This extension defines a mapping from an EGL device to a metal
    device, after it's queried from an EGL display.

IP Status

    No known claims.

New Types

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted as a queried <attribute> in eglQueryDeviceAttribEXT:

        EGL_METAL_DEVICE_ANGLE              0x34A6

Add a new section 2.1.3 (Metal Devices) after 2.1.2 (Devices)

    Somewhat analogous to an EGL device, a Metal device establishes a
    namespace for Metal operations. In the Metal APIs, such devices are
    represented by pointers. For more details, see the Metal
    documentation.

Changes to section 3.2 (Devices)

    Replace the paragraph immediately following the prototype for
    eglQueryDeviceAttribEXT:

    <attribute> may be EGL_METAL_DEVICE_ANGLE.
    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned, and a valid MTLDevice pointer
    corresponding to the EGL device is returned in <value>. This handle
    is compatible with Metal API functions. If the EGL device is not currently
    associated with a Metal device and <attribute> is EGL_METAL_DEVICE_ANGLE,
    EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE is returned, and <value> is left unchanged.

Issues

    None
