Status

    Draft

Version

    Version 4, October 5, 2021

Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #??

Dependencies

    Requires OpenGL ES 2.0

    Written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification.

    Interacts with EGL_ANGLE_create_context_webgl_compatibility (or equivalent)
    extension.

    Interacts with the ARB_texture_rectangle/ANGLE_texture_rectangle extension.

Overview

    With this extension enabled, the OpenGL ES context will have additional
    features and validation to be compatible with the WebGL specification.

New Procedures and Functions

    None


New Tokens

    None

Additions to the OpenGL ES Specification

    Additional validation will be performed according to the the sections of
    the WebGL specification entitled "Differences Between WebGL and OpenGL ES
    2.0" and "Differences Between WebGL and OpenGL ES 3.0".

    GLSL ES shaders targeting version 100 will be treated as though they were
    targeting the WebGL 1 shader specification, and GLSL ES shaders targeting
    version 300 as though they were targeting the WebGL 2 shader specification.

    When the ANGLE_texture_rectangle extension is supported then Enable,
    Disable, and IsEnabled accept the symbolic constant
    TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ANGLE, which controls whether ARB_texture_rectangle is
    allowed to be used by shaders at compilation time. This is initially
    enabled. WebGL implementations may want to use ARB_texture_rectangle when
    compiling their own shaders but not expose the extension to WebGL user
    shaders. This only affects shader compilation and not any other part of
    the ANGLE_texture_rectangle extension, nor the behavior of already
    compiled shaders.

New State

    None

Conformance Tests

    TBD

Issues

    None
