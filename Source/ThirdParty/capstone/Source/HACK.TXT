Follow instructions in COMPILE.TXT for how to compile and run test code.

Note: if you find some strange bugs, it is recommended to firstly clean
the code and try to recompile/reinstall again. This can be done with:

	$ ./make.sh
	$ sudo ./make.sh install

Then test Capstone with cstool, for example:

	$ cstool x32 "90 91"

At the same time, for Java/Ocaml/Python bindings, be sure to always use
the bindings coming with the core to avoid potential incompatibility issue
with older versions.
See bindings/<language>/README for detail instructions on how to compile &
install the bindings.
