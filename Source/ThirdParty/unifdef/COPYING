unifdef copyright licence
-------------------------

All files in this package are distributed under the two-clause BSD
copyright licence, except for the manual page unifdef.1 and the
portability support code in the FreeBSD subdirectory, which all have
a three-clause BSD copyright licence.

Unifdef was derived from software contributed to Berkeley by Dave
Yost. It was rewritten to support ANSI C by Tony Finch. The original
version of unifdef.c carried the four-clause BSD copyright licence.
None of its code remains in this version (though some of the names
remain) so it now carries the more liberal two-clause licence.

Unless otherwise stated, the files in this package are:

  Copyright (c) 2002 - 2020 Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at>

unifdefall.sh is:

  Copyright (c) 2002 - 2013 Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at>
  Copyright (c) 2009 - 2010 Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>

Some files in the tests directory are:

and the portability support code from FreeBSD is below. The fourth
advertising clause that used to appear between clauses 2 and 3 was
rescinded by the University of California Berkeley in 1999.
