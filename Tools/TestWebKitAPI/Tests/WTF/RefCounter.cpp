    //
    // 1) RefCounter(std::function<void()>);
    // 2) ~RefCounter();
    // 3) Ref<Count> token() const;
    // 4) unsigned value() const;
    //
    // We'll test:
    // 1) Construction:
    //   1a) with a callback
    //   1b) without a callback
    // 2) Destruction where the RefCounter::Count has:
    //   2a) a non-zero reference count (Count outlives RefCounter).
    //   2b) a zero reference count (Count is deleted by RefCounter's destructor).
    // 3) Call count to ref/deref the Count object, where:
    //   3a) ref with callback from 0 -> 1.
    //   3b) ref with callback from 1 -> >1.
    //   3c) deref with callback from >1 -> 1.
    //   3d) deref with callback from 1 -> 0.
    //   3d) deref with callback from 1 -> 0.
    //   3e) ref with callback from 1 -> >1 AFTER RefCounter has been destroyed.
    //   3f) deref with callback from >1 -> 1 AFTER RefCounter has been destroyed.
    //   3g) deref with callback from 1 -> 0 AFTER RefCounter has been destroyed.
    //   3h) ref without callback
    //   3i) deref without callback
    //   3j) ref using a Ref rather than a RefPtr (make sure there is no unnecessary reference count churn).
    //   3k) deref using a Ref rather than a RefPtr (make sure there is no unnecessary reference count churn).
    // 4) Test the value of the counter:
    //   4a) at construction.
    //   4b) as read within the callback.
    //   4c) as read after the ref/deref.
