"""FIXME: This script is used by
config_unittest.test_default_configuration__standalone() to read the
default configuration to work around any possible caching / reset bugs. See
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug?id=49360 for the motivation. We can remove
this test when we remove the global configuration cache in config.py."""
