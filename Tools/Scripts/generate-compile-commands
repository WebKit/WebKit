# For things not to horribly break for users during normal use we need to validate the compiler is spitting out
# valid json files. Sometimes if a compile error happens or the user stops the build part way through
# there will be a very invalid json file sitting in the directory. When we go to bundle it up into the final
# compile_commands.json file, we now have an invalid compile_commands.json file and clangd will not work.
# To prevent this from happening we should check that every json file we add is valid, and also ensure there are no 
# duplicate entries. We will build a map of all the valid files.
