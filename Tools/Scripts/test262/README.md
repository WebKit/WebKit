# Test262 Tools

## Runner script

To execute the Test262 Runner script, just call it through your shell.

```sh
./Tools/Scripts/test262-runner
```

### Custom options

If you need to customize the execution, check out `runner.pl --help` for extra commands.

### test262-config.yaml

This yaml file can be used to skip tests. An example file:
```
---
skip:
  paths:
    - test/built-ins/Atomics
  features:
    - SharedArrayBuffer
    - BigInt
  files:
    - test/built-ins/Array/prototype/reverse/length-exceeding-integer-limit-with-object.js
    - test/built-ins/Array/prototype/unshift/length-near-integer-limit.js
```

### test262-expectation.yaml

This file contains all exected failures. If JSC or Test262 is updated, this file should be updated with the new set of expected tests in order for developers to only see errors they introduce.

To update this file, run:
```
runner.pl --save-expectations
```

### test262-results.yaml

This file contains results for all tests. It is updated on every run.

## Import Script

To execute the Test262 Import script, just call it through your shell. The script will update the JSTests/test262 folder.

```sh
./Tools/Scripts/test262-import
```

### Custom options

If you need to customize the execution, check out `import.pl --help` for extra commands.

## Development

The Test262 Runner script requires Perl 5.8.8, to install Perl 5.8.8, use [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/).

Itâ€™s not necessary to install Perl 5.8.8 to execute the runner script if you have a more recent version of Perl 5.x.x installed.

It's also not necessary to install or configure anything extra to execute the runner script. The script dependencies are also stored locally.

### Installing Perlbrew

#### Mac

`\curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash`

#### Linux (Debian derivative):

```sh
sudo apt-get install perlbrew
perlbrew init
```

### Loading Perlbrew

Append the following piece of code to the end of your ~/.bash_profile and start a
new shell, perlbrew should be up and fully functional from there:

`source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc`

### Installing Perl 5.8.8 through Perlbrew

#### Mac

`perlbrew install perl-5.8.8`

#### Linux

`perlbrew --notest install perl-5.8.8   # Perl 5.8.8 has some known compilation errors`

### Switching to Perl versions

```sh
perlbrew switch perl-5.8.8
perlbrew switch perl-5.27.6
# ...
```

### Install cpanminus and Carton

Install cpanminus and Carton to set and manage dependencies.

```sh
perlbrew install-cpanm
cpanm install Carton
```

### Installing dependencies through Carton

From the `Tools/Scripts/test262-helpes/` folder, run `carton install` to install dependencies from the `cpanfile`.

More documentation on the cpanfile [here](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Module-CPANfile/lib/cpanfile.pod).

### Executing the script using Carton:

```sh
carton exec runner.pl
```

### Loading dependencies without Carton

To run the script without Carton, prepend your script file with the following code:

```perl
use FindBin;
use Config;
use Encode;

BEGIN {
    $ENV{DBIC_OVERWRITE_HELPER_METHODS_OK} = 1;

    unshift @INC, ".";
    unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/lib";
    unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/local/lib/perl5";
    unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/local/lib/perl5/$Config{archname}";

    $ENV{LOAD_ROUTES} = 1;
}
```
