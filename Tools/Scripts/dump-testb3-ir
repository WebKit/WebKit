    #    optimization levels
    #
    # 1. Strip the O2 marker off the front--makes things nicer to read
    #
    # 2. If there's a leading paren on the test name, the whole test expression was parenthesized
    #    in the source code, which will make things annoying for us in step 4, just remove it right away

    # 4. Strip everything after the first parenthesis remaining after the above steps.
