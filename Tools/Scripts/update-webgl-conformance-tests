"""Generates WebKit WebGL layout tests from the Khronos WebGL conformance tests"""

# To use this, get a copy of the WebGL conformance tests then run this script
# eg.

#   ~/WebKit/Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-tests --debug --webgl --order=random webgl
#   ~/WebKit/Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-tests --release --webgl --order=random webgl
#   ~/WebKit/Tools/Scripts/check-for-duplicated-platform-test-results -n 2>&1 | grep webgl
#   [ Update TestExpectations ]
#   [ Check in the result ]
