        # simplicity part is particularly important. We don't want to have to have
        # a full-time contributor just philosophising about parallel testing.
        #
        # As such, we just pass off all of the hard work to 'make'. This
        # creates a dummy directory ("$outputDir/.runner") in which we
        # create a dummy Makefile. The Makefile has a 'parallel' rule that
        # depends all tests, other than the ones marked 'serial'. The
        # serial tests are arranged in a chain; the last target in the
        # serial chain depends on 'parallel' and 'all' depends on the head
        # of the chain. Running 'make -j <whatever>' on this Makefile
        # results in 'make' doing all of the hard work:
        #
        # - Load balancing just works. Most systems have a great load balancer in
        #   'make'. If your system doesn't then just install a real 'make'.
        #
        # - Interruptions just work. For example Ctrl-C handling in 'make' is
        #   exactly right. You don't have to worry about zombie processes.
        #
        # We then do some tricks to make failure detection work and to make this
        # totally sound. If a test fails, we don't want the whole 'make' job to
        # stop. We also don't have any facility for makefile-escaping of path names.
        # We do have such a thing for shell-escaping, though. We fix both problems
        # by having the actual work for each of the test rules be done in a shell
        # script on the side. There is one such script per test. The script responds
        # to failure by printing something on the console and then touching a
        # failure file for that test, but then still returns 0. This makes 'make'
        # continue past that failure and complete all the tests anyway.
        #
        # In the end, this script collects all of the failures by searching for
        # files in the .runner directory whose name matches /^test_fail_/, where
        # the thing after the 'fail_' is the test index. Those are the files that
        # would be created by the test scripts if they detect failure. We're
        # basically using the filesystem as a concurrent database of test failures.
        # Even if two tests fail at the same time, since they're touching different
        # files we won't miss any failures.
