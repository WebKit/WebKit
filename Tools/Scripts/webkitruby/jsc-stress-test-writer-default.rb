    # The goals of our parallel test runner are scalability and simplicity. The
    # simplicity part is particularly important. We don't want to have to have
    # a full-time contributor just philosophising about parallel testing.
    #
    # As such, we just pass off all of the hard work to 'make'. This
    # creates a dummy directory ("$outputDir/.runner") in which we
    # create a dummy Makefile. The Makefile has a 'parallel' rule that
    # depends all tests, other than the ones marked 'serial'. The
    # serial tests are arranged in a chain; the last target in the
    # serial chain depends on 'parallel' and 'all' depends on the head
    # of the chain. Running 'make -j <whatever>' on this Makefile
    # results in 'make' doing all of the hard work:
    #
    # - Load balancing just works. Most systems have a great load balancer in
    #   'make'. If your system doesn't then just install a real 'make'.
    #
    # - Interruptions just work. For example Ctrl-C handling in 'make' is
    #   exactly right. You don't have to worry about zombie processes.
    #
    # We then do some tricks to make failure detection work and to make this
    # totally sound. If a test fails, we don't want the whole 'make' job to
    # stop. We also don't have any facility for makefile-escaping of path names.
    # We do have such a thing for shell-escaping, though. We fix both problems
    # by having the actual work for each of the test rules be done in a shell
    # script on the side. There is one such script per test. The script responds
    # to failure by printing something on the console and then touching a
    # failure file for that test, but then still returns 0. This makes 'make'
    # continue past that failure and complete all the tests anyway.
    #
    # In the end, this script collects all of the failures by searching for
    # files in the .runner directory whose name matches /^test_fail_/, where
    # the thing after the 'fail_' is the test index. Those are the files that
    # would be created by the test scripts if they detect failure. We're
    # basically using the filesystem as a concurrent database of test failures.
    # Even if two tests fail at the same time, since they're touching different
    # files we won't miss any failures.
