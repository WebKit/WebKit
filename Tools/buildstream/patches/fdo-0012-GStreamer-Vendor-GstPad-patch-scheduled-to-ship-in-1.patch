+Subject: [PATCH] pad: Never push sticky events in response to a FLUSH_STOP
+
+FLUSH_STOP is meant to clear the flushing state of pads and elements
+downstream, not to process data. Hence, a FLUSH_STOP should not
+propagate sticky events. This is also consistent with how flushes are a
+special case for probes.
+
+Currently this is almost always the case, since a FLUSH_STOP is
+__usually__ preceded by a FLUSH_START, and events (sticky or not) are
+discarded while a pad has the FLUSHING flag active (set by FLUSH_START).
+
+However, it is currently assumed that a FLUSH_STOP not preceded by a
+FLUSH_START is correct behavior, and this will occur while autoplugging
+pipelines are constructed. This leaves us with an unhandled edge case!
+
+This patch explicitly disables sending sticky events when pushing a
+FLUSH_STOP, instead of relying on the flushing flag of the pad, which
+will break in the edge case of a FLUSH_STOP not preceded by a
+FLUSH_START.
+
+If sticky events are propagated in response to a FLUSH_STOP, the
+flushing thread can end up deadlocked in blocking code of a downstream
+pad, such as a blocking probe. Instead, those events should be
+propagated from the streaming thread of the pad when handling a
+non-flushing synchronized event or buffer.
+
+This fixes a deadlock found in WebKit with playbin3 when seeks occur
+before preroll, where the seeking thread ended up stuck in the blocking
+probe of playsink:
