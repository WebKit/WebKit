  HTML manglizer
  --------------

  Copyright (C) 2004 by Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@coredump.cx>

  A trivial utility to automatically check for HTML parsing flaws. Generates
  a basic set of badly mangled tags on request, with auto-refresh back to the 
  script, so that you can point a browser to it once, and let it run until
  it crashes.

  Put it in your cgi-bin directory or any other Apache folder with ExecCGI option
  enabled, then visit the URL http://<yourserver>/<cgidir>/mangleme.cgi.

  When the browser crashes, error-log should be examined for the last matching
  entry generated by mangle.cgi; extract the hexadecimal value, then invoke
  remangle.cgi?hex_value from the browser again. If it crashes, you've reproduced
  the problem, and can save the remangle.cgi page using wget or such.

  Check gallery/ for some samples.
