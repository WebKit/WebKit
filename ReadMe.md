# WebKit

WebKit is a cross-platform web browser engine. On iOS and macOS, it powers Safari, Mail, iBooks, and many other applications.

## Feature Status

Visit [WebKit Feature Status](https://webkit.org/status/) page to see which Web API has been implemented, in development, or under consideration.

## Trying the Latest

On macOS, [download Safari Technology Preview](https://webkit.org/downloads/) to test the latest version of WebKit. On Linux, download [Epiphany Technology Preview](https://webkitgtk.org/epiphany-tech-preview). On Windows, you'll have to build it yourself.

## Reporting Bugs

1. [Search WebKit Bugzilla](https://bugs.webkit.org/query.cgi?format=specific&product=WebKit) to see if there is an existing report for the bug you've encountered.
2. [Create a Bugzilla account](https://bugs.webkit.org/createaccount.cgi) to to report bugs (and to comment on them) if you haven't done so already.
3. File a bug in accordance with [our guidelines](https://webkit.org/bug-report-guidelines/).

Once your bug is filed, you will receive email when it is updated at each stage in the [bug life cycle](https://webkit.org/bug-life-cycle). After the bug is considered fixed, you may be asked to download the [latest nightly](https://webkit.org/nightly) and confirm that the fix works for you.

## Getting the Code

On Windows, follow the [instructions on our website](https://webkit.org/webkit-on-windows/).

### Cloning the Git SVN Repository

Run the following command to clone WebKit's Git SVN repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:WebKit/WebKit.git WebKit
```

or

```
git clone https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit.git WebKit
```

If you want to be able to track Subversion revision from your git checkout, you can run the following command to do so:

```
Tools/Scripts/git-webkit setup-git-svn
```

For information about this, and other aspects of using Git with WebKit, read [the wiki page](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/UsingGitWithWebKit).

### Checking out the Subversion Repository

If you don't want to use Git, run the following command to check out WebKit's Subversion repository:

```
svn checkout https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk WebKit
```

## Building WebKit

### Building macOS Port

Install Xcode and its command line tools if you haven't done so already:

1. **Install Xcode** Get Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/downloads. To build WebKit for OS X, Xcode 5.1.1 or later is required. To build WebKit for iOS Simulator, Xcode 7 or later is required.
2. **Install the Xcode Command Line Tools** In Terminal, run the command: `xcode-select --install`

Run the following command to build a debug build with debugging symbols and assertions:

```
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug
```

For performance testing, and other purposes, use `--release` instead.

### Using Xcode

You can open `WebKit.xcworkspace` to build and debug WebKit within Xcode.

If you don't use a custom build location in Xcode preferences, you have to update the workspace settings to use `WebKitBuild` directory.  In menu bar, choose File > Workspace Settings, then click the Advanced button, select "Custom", "Relative to Workspace", and enter `WebKitBuild` for both Products and Intermediates.

### Embedded Builds

iOS, tvOS and watchOS are all considered embedded builds. The first time after you install a new Xcode, you will need to run:

```
sudo Tools/Scripts/configure-xcode-for-embedded-development
```

Without this step, you will see the error message: "`target specifies product type ‘com.apple.product-type.tool’, but there’s no such product type for the ‘iphonesimulator’ platform.`" when building target `JSCLLIntOffsetsExtractor` of project `JavaScriptCore`.

Run the following command to build a debug build with debugging symbols and assertions for embededded simulators:

```
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug --<platform>-simulator
```

or embedded devices:
```
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug --<platform>-device
```

where `platform` is `ios`, `tvos` or `watchos`.

### Building the GTK+ Port

For production builds:

```
cmake -DPORT=GTK -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -GNinja
ninja
sudo ninja install
```

For development builds:

```
Tools/gtk/install-dependencies
Tools/Scripts/update-webkitgtk-libs
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --debug
```

For more information on building WebKitGTK+, see the [wiki page](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk).

### Building the WPE Port

For production builds:

```
cmake -DPORT=WPE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -GNinja
ninja
sudo ninja install
```

For development builds:

```
Tools/wpe/install-dependencies
Tools/Scripts/update-webkitwpe-libs
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --wpe --debug
```

### Building Windows Port

For building WebKit on Windows, see the [wiki page](https://webkit.org/webkit-on-windows/).

## Running WebKit

### With Safari and Other macOS Applications

Run the following command to launch Safari with your local build of WebKit:

```
Tools/Scripts/run-safari --debug
```

The `run-safari` script sets the `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` environment variable to point to your build products, and then launches `/Applications/Safari.app`. `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` tells the system loader to prefer your build products over the frameworks installed in `/System/Library/Frameworks`.

To run other applications with your local build of WebKit, run the following command:

```
Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-app <application-path>
```

### iOS Simulator

Run the following command to launch iOS simulator with your local build of WebKit:

```
run-safari --debug --ios-simulator
```

In both cases, if you have built release builds instead, use `--release` instead of `--debug`.

### Linux Ports

If you have a development build, you can use the run-minibrowser script, e.g.:

```
run-minibrowser --debug --wpe
```

Pass one of `--gtk`, `--jsc-only`, or `--wpe` to indicate the port to use.
