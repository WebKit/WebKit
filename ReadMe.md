# WebKit with patches

This is a build of WebKit with some extra patches used by [bun](https://bun.sh)

The changes to WebKit are as follows:

- `bmalloc::api::availableMemory()` accounts for cgroups 1 & 2 memory limits
- `JSC::ErrorInstance` has a `captureStackTrace` function which lets you update the internally-stored `Vector<StackTrace>`
- `JSC::JSGlobalObject` has a `double overridenDateNow` field which lets you override the timestamp used for `Date.now()` and `new Date()`
- `JSC::VM` has a `onComputeErrorInfo` callback which lets the embedder customize how `Error.prototype.stack` strings are formatted (Bun uses this to make them match V8's behavior, for Node.js compatibility)
- More things are exported
- Typed Arrays can be passed through DOMJIT
- ExternalStringImpl has an extra pointer field
- `OptionsList::showPrivateScriptsInStackTraces()` enables ImplementationVisibilty::Private functions showing up in stack traces
- Many of the locks in the C API are removed. Locking is handled internally by the bundler.
- `JSString` iterator that exposes the pointer of each nested `JSRopeString`'s underlying buffer to a callback without flattening/allocating an entirely new string. This is useful for native code piping strings from JavaScript to elsewhere, or manually allocating strings outside of `WTF::String`. `console.log` or server-side rendering (when not using streams) are examples.
- `ExternalStringImpl` now supports static strings. This is somewhat of a hack; the better solution for this case is a script that generates all the static strings at compile time using `NeverDestroyed<StaticStringImpl>`, however need to figure out a way to do that well from Zig.
- `OptionsList::useV8DateParser` enables v8's date parser.

Still need to figure out how to get the remote inspector to work.

# WebKit

WebKit is a cross-platform web browser engine. On iOS and macOS, it powers Safari, Mail, Apple Books, and many other applications. For more information about WebKit, see the [WebKit project website](https://webkit.org/).

## Trying the Latest

On macOS, [download Safari Technology Preview](https://webkit.org/downloads/) to test the latest version of WebKit. On Linux, download [Epiphany Technology Preview](https://webkitgtk.org/epiphany-tech-preview). On Windows, you'll have to build it yourself.

## Reporting Bugs

1. [Search WebKit Bugzilla](https://bugs.webkit.org/query.cgi?format=specific&product=WebKit) to see if there is an existing report for the bug you've encountered.
2. [Create a Bugzilla account](https://bugs.webkit.org/createaccount.cgi) to report bugs (and comment on them) if you haven't done so already.
3. File a bug in accordance with [our guidelines](https://webkit.org/bug-report-guidelines/).

Once your bug is filed, you will receive email when it is updated at each stage in the [bug life cycle](https://webkit.org/bug-life-cycle). After the bug is considered fixed, you may be asked to download the [latest nightly](https://webkit.org/nightly) and confirm that the fix works for you.

## Getting the Code

Run the following command to clone WebKit's Git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit.git WebKit
```

You can enable [git fsmonitor](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corefsmonitor) to make many git commands faster (such as `git status`) with `git config core.fsmonitor true`

## Building WebKit

### Building for Apple platforms

Install Xcode and its command line tools if you haven't done so already:

1. **Install Xcode** Get Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/downloads. To build WebKit for OS X, Xcode 5.1.1 or later is required. To build WebKit for iOS Simulator, Xcode 7 or later is required.
2. **Install the Xcode Command Line Tools** In Terminal, run the command: `xcode-select --install`

Run the following command to build a macOS debug build with debugging symbols and assertions:

```
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug
```

For performance testing, and other purposes, use `--release` instead.

#### Embedded Builds

To build for an embedded platform like iOS, tvOS, or watchOS, pass a platform
argument to `build-webkit`.

For example, to build a debug build with debugging symbols and assertions for
embedded simulators:

```
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug --<platform>-simulator
```

or embedded devices:

```
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug --<platform>-device
```

where `platform` is `ios`, `tvos` or `watchos`.

#### Using Xcode

You can open `WebKit.xcworkspace` to build and debug WebKit within Xcode.
Select the "Everything up to WebKit + Tools" scheme to build the entire
project.

If you don't use a custom build location in Xcode preferences, you have to
update the workspace settings to use `WebKitBuild` directory.  In menu bar,
choose File > Workspace Settings, then click the Advanced button, select
"Custom", "Relative to Workspace", and enter `WebKitBuild` for both Products
and Intermediates.

### Building the GTK Port

For production builds:

```
cmake -DPORT=GTK -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -GNinja
ninja
sudo ninja install
```

For development builds:

```
Tools/gtk/install-dependencies
Tools/Scripts/update-webkitgtk-libs
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk --debug
```

For more information on building WebKitGTK, see the [wiki page](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk).

### Building the WPE Port

For production builds:

```
cmake -DPORT=WPE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -GNinja
ninja
sudo ninja install
```

For development builds:

```
Tools/wpe/install-dependencies
Tools/Scripts/update-webkitwpe-libs
Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --wpe --debug
```

### Building Windows Port

For building WebKit on Windows, see the [WebKit on Windows page](https://docs.webkit.org/Ports/WindowsPort.html).

## Running WebKit

### With Safari and Other macOS Applications

Run the following command to launch Safari with your local build of WebKit:

```
Tools/Scripts/run-safari --debug
```

The `run-safari` script sets the `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` environment variable to point to your build products, and then launches `/Applications/Safari.app`. `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` tells the system loader to prefer your build products over the frameworks installed in `/System/Library/Frameworks`.

To run other applications with your local build of WebKit, run the following command:

```
Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-app <application-path>
```

### iOS Simulator

Run the following command to launch iOS simulator with your local build of WebKit:

```
run-safari --debug --ios-simulator
```

In both cases, if you have built release builds instead, use `--release` instead of `--debug`.

### Linux Ports

If you have a development build, you can use the `run-minibrowser` script, e.g.:

```
run-minibrowser --debug --wpe
```

Pass one of `--gtk`, `--jsc-only`, or `--wpe` to indicate the port to use.
