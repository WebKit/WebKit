Syntax: %(program_name)s [--verbose=#] [--git-commit=<COMMITISH>] [--output=vs7] [--filter=-x,+y,...]

  The style guidelines this tries to follow are those in
    http://webkit.org/coding/coding-style.html

  Every problem is given a confidence score from 1-5, with 5 meaning we are
  certain of the problem, and 1 meaning it could be a legitimate construct.
  This will miss some errors, and is not a substitute for a code review.

  To prevent specific lines from being linted, add a '// NOLINT' comment to the
  end of the line.

  Linted extensions are .cpp, .c and .h.  Other file types will be ignored.

  Flags:

    verbose=#
      Specify a number 0-5 to restrict errors to certain verbosity levels.

    git-commit=<COMMITISH>
      Check style for a specified git commit.
      Note that the program checks style based on current local file
      instead of actual diff of the git commit.  So, if the files are
      updated after the specified git commit, the information of line
      number may be wrong.

    output=vs7
      By default, the output is formatted to ease emacs parsing.  Visual Studio
      compatible output (vs7) may also be used.  Other formats are unsupported.

    filter=-x,+y,...
      Specify a comma-separated list of category-filters to apply: only
      error messages whose category names pass the filters will be printed.
      (Category names are printed with the message and look like
      "[whitespace/indent]".)  Filters are evaluated left to right.
      "-FOO" and "FOO" means "do not print categories that start with FOO".
      "+FOO" means "do print categories that start with FOO".

      Examples: --filter=-whitespace,+whitespace/braces
                --filter=whitespace,runtime/printf,+runtime/printf_format
                --filter=-,+build/include_what_you_use

      To see a list of all the categories used in %(program_name)s, pass no arg:
