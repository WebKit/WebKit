"""Does WebKit-lint on C/C++ or text files.

The goal of this script is to identify places in the code that *may*
be in non-compliance with WebKit style.  It does not attempt to fix
up these problems -- the point is to educate.  It does also not
attempt to find all problems, or to ensure that everything it does
find is legitimately a problem.

In particular, we can get very confused by /* and // inside strings!
We do a small hack, which is to ignore //'s with "'s after them on the
same line, but it is far from perfect (in either direction).
