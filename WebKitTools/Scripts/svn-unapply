# "patch" script for Web Kit Open Source Project, used to apply patches.

# Differences from invoking "patch -p0 -R":
#
#   Handles added files (does a svn rm). 
#   Handles removed files (does a svn add). 
#   Paths from Index: lines are used rather than the paths on the patch lines, which
#       makes patches generated by "cvs diff" work (increasingly unimportant since we
#       use Subversion now).
#   ChangeLog patches use --fuzz=3 to prevent rejects.
#   Handles binary files (requires patches made by svn-create-patch).
#
# Missing features:
#
#   Handle property changes.
#   Handle file moves (requires patches made by svn-create-patch).
#   Use version numbers in the patch file and do a 3-way merge.
#   When reversing an addition, check that the file matches what's being removed.
#   Notice a patch that's being unapplied at the "wrong level" and make it work anyway.
#   Do a dry run on the whole patch and don't do anything if part of the patch is
#       going to fail (probably too strict unless we do the ChangeLog thing).
