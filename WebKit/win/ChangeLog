        Fixed <rdar://problem/5055182> The page cache has no global cap.
        
        The main WebKit changes are:
            1. Gutted IWebBackForwardList::setPageCacheSize and IWebBackForwardList:: 
            pageCacheSize because they're deprecated on Mac now. I didn't remove
            them, though, because doing so can cause COM badness.
            
            2. Added IWebPreferences::setUsesPageCache IWebPreferences:: 
            usesPageCache because that's the new Mac API. I added them to the end
            of IWebPreferences to avoid COM badness.
            
            3. Centralized calculation of object cache and page cache sizes inside
            WebPreferences. 
            
            Changed our old behavior of reading a preference and applying a fudge 
            factor with a new behavior of just using the preference directly. The 
            old behavior was confusing and often inappropriate. (For example, if 
            you set a page cache size of 100, a 256MB machine would somewhat 
            arbitrarily reduce that number to 98.)

        WebKit DCOM compatibility.
        When a WebKit hosting app calls RunAsLocalServer, the class object for CLSID_WebDebugProgram
        is registered to allow creation across processes.  This is for future compatibility with
        Drosera.

        Added new exported function: RunAsLocalServer.
        This exposes WebKit inside the running exe as a LocalServer32 (COM server), which
        will allow Drosera to connect to it via DCOM.

        We use the DCOM Universal Marshaller from oleaut32.dll, which performs marshalling
        based on type libraries, so as part of this change, I've done some work on making our
        interfaces compatible with this marshaller.
        
        Updated for compatibility w/ COM automation, and fixed up our type library.        
        Added type library registration/unregistration code.
        Marked methods not compatible w/ automation/marshalling as [local].
        
        As a side-effect, with these changes, the .NET tlbimp tool can create a .NET interop
        assembly to theoretically allow WebKit to be invoked from .NET apps.  I haven't
        tried this.  It could end up being useful to drive API testing.
        
        To test, I wrote a small app that calls:
        ::CoCreateInstance(CLSID_IWebDebugProgram, 0, CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER, IID_IUnknown, (void**)&viewUnknown);
        Using this instantiated class, I'm able to iterate the exisitng webviews and retrieve their
        source, title, URL, etc.

        The basic approach is to have Frames start out containing an empty document instead of absolutely nothing,
        so there is no need to initialize them on demand. Various side effects of that cause both of these bugs.
        
        However, this caused many regressions so I had to fix the fallout.

        Fixed <rdar://5126201> crash closing tab when the two following tabs are empty.
        Basically this fix involved one thing, which lead to another thing.  First, the crash
        was fixed by moving the call to webView->close from SearchableWebView::onDestroy to
        WebViewWndProc when WM_DESTROY message is processed.  We now want only WebKit handling
        the closure of a WebView, so all calls to WebView::close have been removed, save for
        the one call in WebViewWndProc.

        Added a new configuration to WebKit.vcproj called Debug_Internal to be

        be used by opensource builds, and will always link against release
        versions of CF, CFNet, CG, etc. Debug_Internal is identical to Debug
        except for the property sheet it uses, and the Debug configuration
        doesn't register WebKit_debug.dll when finished.

        We now have two macros, $(WebKitConfigSuffix) and

        more like the Mac and crawl the frame tree up front ensuring everyone is up to date before painting.

        Due to OpenSource r20178, all of the sudden we were trying to handle page caching on Windows
        even though it is not hooked up yet.  The resulted in very particular cases ending up calling 
        clear() in FrameLoader::provisionalLoadStarted().  One such particular case was if a page *would*
        be "cachable" (no frames, no passwords, etc etc), and you start a download from that page.
        
        The fix for now is to manually set the pageCacheSize to 0 whenever we create new pages on Windows.
        This prevents the "Should I cache this page?" checking from getting far enough to clear the document.
        It so happens this involves exactly one line.

        Fix <rdar://problem/5007566> Crash in WebFrame::dataSource on dni.ru

        The fix for the bug was to zero out WebFrame's Frame pointer in
        WebFrame::frameLoaderDestroyed, and then to null-check or ASSERT
        non-null as appropriate. All IWebFrame methods that depend on the Frame
        pointer will return E_FAIL if it is null, and everywhere within
        WebFrame that wasn't null-checking before will now explicitly ASSERT.

        I also changed all uses of d->frame and WebFrame::impl() to use the
        core() function for consistency, and so that there is only one code
        path for getting from a WebFrame to a Frame.

        Fix for <rdar://problem/4874565> Draw context menus using CG

        Added new delegate calls to the UIDelegate to draw context menus 
        that match the context menus in the app.

        * Interfaces/IWebUIDelegate.idl: Added five new delegate calls. 
        They take care of asking if there is a custom menu implementation,  
        adding custom drawing data to the menu items and tracking the popup 
        in a custom way, measuring the items when it comes time to draw the 
        menus, actually drawing the items, and properly destroying the 
        custom data when the menu is destroyed.
        * WebView.cpp:
        (WebView::handleContextMenuEvent): This function now takes care of 
        popping up the menu after the event is dispatched through WebCore. 
        WebCore used to pop up the menu itself, but having WebKit pop up 
        the menu matches the Mac and allows up to get rid of two functions 
        on ContextMenu that are empty on the Mac. It also makes more sense 
        to have this code reside in WebKit now that there are calls over 
        the UIDelegate to draw the menus.

        In the process of making enabled/disabled items and item state work
        on Boomer, we discovered that we could not get our sub-menus to
        work with using notify by position. This switches the Boomer
        context menus over to use the more conventional menu command
        notification of id. This sends a WM_COMMAND message instead of a
        WM_MENUCOMMAND message. We can differentiate the context menu
        WM_COMMAND messaged from the other ones because the high word of
        wParam is 0 when the message comes from a menu. So now WM_COMMAND
        handles the context menu actions.

        Fixed <rdar://problem/4844838> Whole document leak seen

        Copied *very nice* (NOT!) WebKit Mac idiom of calling
        FrameLoader::detachFromParent when closing the WebView.
        We need to do this so event listeners that retain the document
        get destroyed, and so the unload event gets dispatched.

        This is pretty silly. Instead, the document/frame/interpreter should
        be responsible for cleaning up after itself.

        Implemented window.open. Rough around the edges right now.

        - Converted WebMutableURLRequest to use a ResourceRequest as its
        backing store, to avoid yet another way of representing this data.
        - Changed WebMutableURLRequests's timeoutInterval to double, to match
        ResourceRequest and NSURLRequest.
        - Added BSTRToKURL and KURLToBSTR helper functions.

        The issue was a resource loader making a callback to a
        frame after the frame had been destroyed. This doesn't happen on Mac
        because Mac WebKit cancels all loads before tearing down frames.
        
        The solution is to add a callback to Win WebKit to allow a frame
        to cancel its main resource load. This is a temporary work-around.
        It is temporary because it doesn't address pending subresource loads.
        The long-term solution we anticipate is to have a legitimate loader

        Prep work:
            - fixed WebFrame/WebView circular reference leak: ownership now looks like this
              (same as Mac):
                - WebView -> WebCore::Page -> WebCore::Frame 
                                                    -> WebFrame
                                                    -> WebCore::FrameTree -> WebCore::Frame...
            - fixed notification center circular reference leak: The notification center
              no longer retains its clients; clients must take care to remove themselves
              upon destruction.

        Real work:
            - The WebView's onSize handler now updates the frame geometry of the main frame. 
            This used to happen implicitly, since the WebView window and the main frame were
            synonymous.
            
            - Changed WebFrame painting code to use WebCore's FrameView painting code instead
            of rolling its own.
            
            - Removed WebFrame::initWithName from the public COM API and replaced it with
            the private initializer, WebFrame::initWithWebFrameView. We intend to deprecate 
            initWithName on Mac because it's meaningless -- only WebCore should create frames.
