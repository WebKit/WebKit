        Fixes http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12086, http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12088, 
        possibly http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12087, and probably a slew of others

        WebHistoryItems returned from the WebBackForwardList accessors were being release/retained out-of-order
        by the Safari app.  This bug never surfaced before because the WebBackForwardList had a retain on the 
        item, preventing deallocation. Since the items are now just temporary wrappers, the list 
        is no longer actually retaining them.

        This solution is to simulate the ownership with a [[id retain] autorelease] - gross, but maybe the 
        only solution for now...  =/

        We can possibly consider reverting this fix at a later date - that task is marked by

            immediately follow the calls that retain.

        (-[WebHTMLViewPrivate clear]): Added method to drop references to other objects.
        We want to do this at "close" time, rather than waiting for deallocation time.
        This is especially important for the data source, which indirectly keeps a number of
        objects alive.
        (-[WebHTMLView close]): Added an explicit call to clear out the data source on the
        plug-in controller. Without this, we'd see the plug-in controller making calls to
        a deallocated data source during the layout tests. Added a call to the new clear method
        on the private object so that we release the objects at close time instead of waiting
        for deallocation time.

        Redundant keydown, keypress, keyup events sent for arrow keys

        Added another layer of ugly hacks around AppKit event dispatching.

        1. For arrow keys, keyDown: is invoked after performKeyEquivalent:, so had to store
        _private->keyDownEvent in both methods, and make it persist after leaving them.

        2. For Esc, AppKit calls performKeyEquivalent: with a fake event of some kind,
        use [NSApp currentEvent] to check for this to prevent it from being passed to  WebCore.

        (WebChromeClient::pageRect): It may seem weird for the page to ask the Chrome/ChromeClient
        about its own dimensions. The idea here is that we're asking the Chrome how
        much space it has devoted to the page. We have API for this (-webViewContentRect), but 
        it was documented incorrectly (even Safari used it wrong), so we don't use 
        it anymore. Once we fix our API/documentation, we can return to making a
        delegate callback to ask for the page's size.

        When contentEditable, cursor doesn't change to hand
        
        Allow the behaviour of editable links to be specified by a WebPreference
        The preference WebKitEditableLinkBehavior has four options:
         - AlwaysLive: Safari 2.0 behaviour
         - OnlyLiveWithShiftKey: Firefox/WinIE behaviour (and prior WebKit-ToT behaviour)
         - LiveWhenNotFocused: Editable links are live only when their editable block is not
             focused, or when the shift key is pressed
         - DefaultBehavior: This is the same as OnlyLiveWithShiftKey.

        The way of detecting a failed icon load before was to try and construct
        an image from the icon and if that image construction failed, mark the icon
        as missing.  
        A much more efficient way is to check for an error response.  We'll still
        check for invalid image data, but most servers will correctly return an HTTP 
        error on a missing icon.

        Bug 10200: [Drosera] Deadlock between Drosera and Safari while loading page
        http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10200

        Prevent reentrancy in our debugger callbacks. This was causing a deadlock in Drosera because
        suspendProcessIfPaused was being called during a DO call into Safari.

        Preventing reentrancy also prevents scripts that Drosera injects and evaluates from showing
        up in rare cases (such as a iframe loading about:blank). I thought this would prevent cases
        where you call a function from the console and expect it to break on a breakpoint in them, but
        this appears to never have worked even without this change. When that is figured out we can
        reconsider a better solution to reentrancy. I have filed that as bug 10214.

        I also removed the NSRunLoop runMode:beforeDate: calls since DO handles this for us since
        we don't use "onway void" as the return type for the callbacks. Note: using onway void for
        the listener callbacks causes bad synchronization issues and obscure crashes.

        I kind of hate to do this, but this is the best way to work around buggy plug-ins like Flash that assume that

        optimization to avoid GETing a missing favicon more than once. The solution
        is a happy marriage of optimizations, ensuring that we *retain* the missing
        favicon's "i am missing" data without posting a notification or saving it to disk.

        <rdar://problem/4634290> Cannot selectively install a custom
        scroller that differs from the default Aqua frame size.

        Adds two new private methods to WebFrameView that allows
        an application to set a custom scroll view class. This is needed
        if the application wants to install a custom scroller that is wider
        than the typical scroller, because NSScrollView does the content
        rect calculations in a class method (ignoring custom scrollers.)
        The _setScrollViewClass method requires the class to be a subclass
        of WebDynamicScrollBarView, or nil can be passed to reset to the default class.
        A new scroll view of the specified class will then replace the previous
        one without the need to reload content of the frame.

        - Added ivars for OpenGL support.  Someday it would be nice to refactor this class so

          WebBaseNetscapePluginView to make more efficient use of space, for example by not
          keeping OpenGL-related ivars for Quickdraw plug-ins.
        
        * Plugins/WebBaseNetscapePluginView.m:
        - Declared a bunch of internal methods for OpenGL support (see below).
        - Removed "forUpdate" from CoreGraphics port state struct; it was always set to "YES",
          so I just cleaned up the silly code that used it.
        - Declared OpenGL port state struct.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView saveAndSetNewPortStateForUpdate:]):
        - Moved a CoreGraphics-related assertion down to the big "switch" statement.
        - Don't set window.type here -- according to the Netscape Plug-in API docs, the plug-in
          should default to "windowed" mode, and may call NPN_SetValue() during its NPN_New() to
          request that the browser use a "windowless" (offscreen) context instead.
        - Moved the assertion from the top of this method here; removed a less restrictive
          assertion that is now obsolete.
        - Removed "forUpdate" flag from CoreGraphics port state struct.
        - Fill in OpenGL port state struct.  Set up the viewport appropriately for both windowed
          and windowless OpenGL plug-ins.  Windowed plug-ins need to have their GL viewport
          transformed by the amount the plug-in is clipped; windowless plug-ins are drawn off-screen
          into a surface whose geometry is never changed or clipped, so they may always draw with
          a viewport origin of (0, 0).
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView restorePortState:]):
        - Removed "forUpdate" flag from CoreGraphics port state struct.
        - Restore the old OpenGL context saved by -saveAndSetNewPortStateForUpdate:.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView sendEvent:]):
        - Updated an assertion to also include OpenGL.  To ensure that attached plug-in window movements
          happen atomically with web page redisplays, we assert that the plug-in's window is set only while
          the plug-in view is redrawing.
        - Same deal as with the assertion; only save/set port state when redrawing the plug-in view.  Plug-ins
          that use the new drawing models are only allowed to draw when the web page draws.  I might consider
          changing this for windowed OpenGL plug-ins, since they always obscure the page content anyway.

        - Plug-ins are "windowed" by default.  This is not a change from our previous behavior, but this is a

        - Implemented NPNVsupportsOpenGLBool; returns YES since we now support the OpenGL drawing model.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView setVariable:value:]):
        - Implemented NPPVpluginWindowBool, which allows plug-ins to specify whether they should be rendered in
          "windowed" or "windowless" mode.  This is an older part of the Netscape Plug-in API that was never
          implemented in WebKit.  "Windowed" Quickdraw plug-ins do not actually reside in a separate window, and
          can already do many of the same things (such as transparency) that only "windowless" plug-ins can do on
          other platforms.  However, we need the "windowed" vs. "windowless" distinction for OpenGL plug-ins so
          that they have some way of specifying whether they should be rendered on an accelerated overlay surface,
          composited into the browser window.
        - Support for setting the drawing model to OpenGL.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView _viewHasMoved]):
        - Renamed from -viewHasMoved:, and moved down in the file.
        - None of this work is necessary when the plug-in is not in a window; the plug-in's state will be properly
          restored when it is moved back into a window.
        - Reshape OpenGL surface window here.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView _createAGLContextIfNeeded]):

        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView _createWindowedAGLContext]):
        - Creates a windowed AGL context, which is an AGL context attached to a child window.  This is the only way
          to get true hardware acceleration.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView _createWindowlessAGLContext]):
        - Creates a windowless AGL context, which is an AGL context attached to an offscreen buffer.  This buffer can
          then be blitted back into the browser window with a different alpha, or scaled, or whatever.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView _cglContext]):
        - Returns the underlying CGL context from the AGL context.  We give the plug-in access to the CGL context because
          CGL is the more primitive of the GL drawable APIs and allows for finer control over the context.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView _getAGLOffscreenBuffer:width:height:]):
        - Returns the buffer allocated for the offscreen AGL context, if there is one.

          bits back into the plug-in view.  This is kind of tricky because it has to convert the offscreen buffer in-place
          from BGRA to RGBA so that it can be wrapped in an NSBitmapImageRep.  See comments.

        Bug 9731: [Drosera] crash when trying to access the scope chain
        http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9731

        Because of <rdar://problem/4608404> the WebScriptObject, _globalObj, that
        WebCoreScriptDebugger holds is unprotected each time the page changes.
        This causes Drosera to crash Safari when trying to access the scope chain.
        We simply need to detach and re-attach the debugger when the window script
        object is cleared until 4608404 is fixed. This change also attaches the
        debugger before we call the windowScriptObjectAvailable: delegate method,
        so the debugger is ready before anyone might use the window object.

        Adds a close method to WebView, this needs to be called when the 
        WebView is no longer needed. To make this easier for the common cases
        there is now an "auto close" on WebView that listens to the view's
        parent window. If the parent window closes and the WebView has no
        hostWindow then the WebView is automatically closed if autoClose is YES.
        To manage WebView closing yourself call setAutoClose: and pass NO.

        When a WebView closes it will tear-down and not be usable anymore.
        Close will will called on various other internal objects as a part
        of this, to ensure proper tear-down in GC without relying on finalize.

        Smart insert and delete, continuous spell checking and autoscroll
        can now be used for any WebView, not just editable ones. All of
        these make sense for documents that might contain content editable 
        areas or our new text fields. Autoscroll is usefull for dragging
        for file input controls also.

        Added a SPI to toggle WebViews tab key behavior, tabKeyCyclesThroughElements.
        WebHTMLView's _interceptEditingKeyEvent now uses WebView's
        tabKeyCyclesThroughElements state to determine whether or not
        to process tab key events. The idea here is that tabKeyCyclesThroughElements
        will be YES when this WebView is being used in a browser, and we
        desire the behavior where tab moves to the next element in tab order.
        If tabKeyCyclesThroughElements is NO, it is likely that the WebView
        is being embedded as the whole view, as in Mail, and tabs should input
        tabs as expected in a text editor. Using Option-Tab always cycles
        through elements.

        <rdar://problem/4564131> WebPluginDatabase setAdditionalWebPlugInPaths needs to be per WebView

        Added some WebView SPI so that individual WebViews may have different plugin search paths.  There are some 
        limitations with the approach taken here:

        - JavaScript may only access the global plugin DB.
        - When this SPI is in use, certain WebView methods may not give accurate results, such as +canShowMIMEType:.
        - This only works for plugins referenced using the <object> or <embed> tags; plugins that reside in non-standard
        file system locations may not be loaded directly into frames.
        
        None of these issues are important to the client that needs this SPI.  Rather than re-architect our entire
        plugin database, I think it is better to simply accept these limitations for now.

        * Plugins/WebPluginDatabase.h:
        Added "plugInPaths" ivar, so different plugin databases can have different search paths.
        * Plugins/WebPluginDatabase.m:
        (+[WebPluginDatabase installedPlugins]):
        Give the global plugin database the default plugin search paths.
        (+[WebPluginDatabase setAdditionalWebPlugInPaths:]):
        Removed static global; this method now sets the plugin paths on the global plugin database.
        (-[WebPluginDatabase setPlugInPaths:]):
        Setter method for plugin paths.
        (-[WebPluginDatabase close]):
        New method; called when the plugin database is no longer needed (when its WebView is being destroyed).
        (-[WebPluginDatabase init]):
        Don't refresh in -init, so that callers can set the DB's plugin path array before it refreshes.
        (-[WebPluginDatabase dealloc]):
        Moved here from near the bottom of the file.  Release new ivar.
        (-[WebPluginDatabase refresh]):
        Use the plugInPaths ivar instead of calling pluginLocations().
        Notify plugin packages when they are added to and removed from a plugin database.  A plugin package will
        unload itself when it is removed from all of its plugin databases.
        The only really tricky thing here is that the global MIME <-> view class registrations are only modified
        by the shared plugin DB.
        (+[WebPluginDatabase _defaultPlugInPaths]):
        Refactored from the old pluginLocations() function; returns the default set of plugin search paths.

        * Plugins/WebBasePluginPackage.h:
        * Plugins/WebBasePluginPackage.m:

        notifications (including the inspector window's) when the WebView is in a hidden tab.

        <rdar://problem/4558301> REGRESSION (420+): After clearing history and closing bookmark view window,
        attempting to select Safari's menu bar results in a crash

        * Misc/WebNSWindowExtras.m:
        (replacementPostWindowNeedsDisplay):
        My fix yesterday for 4557117 was not quite good enough.  Now that we cancel the display timer for a
        window *before* it deallocates, we need to make sure that while a window deallocates, no new display
        timers are scheduled for that window.  This is actually possible, as 4558301 demonstrates.
        Luckily, NSWindow sets a handy "windowDying" flag when it deallocates, so we can just check that flag
        and bail out of the throttle hack if it is set.  This should fix the last of the crashes involving
        display timers scheduled for deallocated or deallocating windows.

        <rdar://problem/4551938> More options needed for window display throttle

        We decided to play it safe and leave our window flushing behavior unchanged from the previous
        public release.  By default, CoreGraphics deferred updates are once again OFF, and the window
        display throttle is OFF.

        Individual applications should set the WebKitThrottleWindowDisplayPreferenceKey and 
        WebKitEnableDeferredUpdatesPreferenceKey defaults to suit their needs.

        Old behavior (like 10.4.6): WebKitThrottleWindowDisplayPreferenceKey=0 (or unset), 
        WebKitEnableDeferredUpdatesPreferenceKey (or unset).

        Tear-free scrolling/animations: WebKitThrottleWindowDisplayPreferenceKey=0 (or unset),
        WebKitEnableDeferredUpdatesPreferenceKey=1.  While this configuration fixes the tearing issues
        caused by over-flushing, some applications will experience performance problems as over-flushing
        with CG deferred updates enabled will cause the app to block.

        Tear-free scrolling/animations, high performance: WebKitThrottleWindowDisplayPreferenceKey=1, 
        WebKitEnableDeferredUpdatesPreferenceKey=1.  This is the riskiest configuration in that it
        enables the window display throttle "feature", potentially breaking applications' assumptions
        about when displays occur.  However, it provides the "best of both worlds", in that updates
        are tear-free, and performance impact should me minimal.

        * WebView/WebPreferenceKeysPrivate.h:
        Declared WebKitThrottleWindowDisplayPreferenceKey and WebKitEnableDeferredUpdatesPreferenceKey.

        Part of <rdar://problem/4466508> Add 64-bit support to the Netscape Plugin API

        Added to the Netscape Plugin API the concept of "plugin drawing models".  The drawing model
        determines the kind of graphics context created by the browser for the plugin, as well as 
        the Mac types of various Netscape Plugin API data structures.

        There is a drawing model to represent the old QuickDraw-based API.  It is used by default
        if QuickDraw is available on the system, unless the plugin specifies another drawing model.

        The big change is the addition of the CoreGraphics drawing model.  A plugin may request this
        drawing model to obtain access to a CGContextRef for drawing, instead of a QuickDraw CGrafPtr.

        * Plugins/WebBaseNetscapePluginView.h:
        Added PluginPort union, which wraps a NP_Port and a NP_CGContext.  This is to make access to
        the nPort and lastSetPort ivars more convenient now that the port type differs based on the 
        drawing model.
        Changed types of nPort and lastSetPort to PluginPort so they can be used with any drawing model.
        Added drawingModel ivar.
        * Plugins/WebBaseNetscapePluginView.m:
        Renamed PortState to PortState_QD.  PortState is now an opaque pointer.  PortState_QD cannot be
        used if QuickDraw is unavailable.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView fixWindowPort]):
        Cannot be used if QuickDraw is unavailable.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginView saveAndSetNewPortStateForUpdate:]):

        Follow-up to my previous PLT fix.  I found upon further testing (by dramatically decreasing the
        allowed display rate) that +_webkit_displayThrottledWindows did not always force a display when
        necessary.  The reason is that I was not giving a proper timeout to CFRunLoopRunInMode().  I was
        passing 0, which was causing only "expired" timers to fire.  This method is actually supposed to
        block until all currently scheduled display timers fire.

        I tested this change and found that it did not affect my PLT times when the display rate was
        capped to 60 fps.  It also behaves as expected when the display rate is set much lower (say, 1
        display per second); my previous fix did not work well at such display rates.

        * Misc/WebNSWindowExtras.m:
        (+[NSWindow _webkit_displayThrottledWindows]):
        Run the runloop for an amount of time equal to the minimum allowed interval between displays.
        This ensures that we'll block until all currently scheduled display timers fire (but we won't
        block for future display timers).

        Safari's Page Load Test (PLT) saturates the runloop with so many sources that timers are not allowed to fire 
        as frequently as they should.  This is a general problem with the PLT -- because of this, it does not measure
        work done in timer callbacks during/after the page load process.

        Unfortunately, this aspect of the PLT interferes with our window display throttle hack.  Because we throttle
        display using timers, and the PLT starves timers, most of the pages loaded by the PLT do not actually display.
        This makes the PLT run "too fast", yielding ridiculously fast numbers compared to when throttling is disabled.

        I've added a new method that the PLT can call after each page load to force any starved display throttle timers
        to fire.  By doing this, Safari's PLT will be guaranteed to display each page at least once.

        Improvement to my NSWindow display throttle hack.  Remember the last flush time instead of the last display time.
        Our goal is to never draw less than 1/60th of a second after the window is flushed in order to avoid blocking on
        a CG coalesced update.  Using the last display time is close, but this is much more accurate.  I have verified that
        this further improves our score on BenchJS Test 1 (by 9.8% with the status bar shown compared to the previous build),
        as well as on our internal PLT scores by a smaller percentage.

        Also deleted declarations of two methods that didn't actually exist (loadHistory and initWithFile:), 
        and added comments about which methods should become public API, WebKit-internal, or file-internal.

        (-[WebHistoryPrivate arrayRepresentation]):
        This method, called only by _saveHistoryGuts:, used to deliberately leave out items that violated
        either the age limit or the item count limit. Now all the items are included (and thus saved), and
        all the pruning is done at load time, so clients can keep track of the pruned items by observing
        the new WebHistoryItemsDiscardedWhileLoadingNotification
        (-[WebHistoryPrivate _loadHistoryGutsFromURL:savedItemsCount:collectDiscardedItemsInto:error:]):
        Now keeps track of all the items that violated the age limit or item count limit in the new
        collectedDiscardedItemsInto: parameter. Also, now processes items in forward order rather than
        reverse order to fix 3126419. Now uses compare: rather than _webkit_compareDay: to check against
        age limit; this is faster and also more correct (most noticeable with small age limits).
        (-[WebHistoryPrivate loadFromURL:collectDiscardedItemsInto:error:]):
        new collectDiscardedItemsInto: parameter, passed into _loadHistoryGuts:...
        (-[WebHistory loadFromURL:error:]):
        Now sends new WebHistoryItemsDiscardedWhileLoadingNotification if any items were discarded due

        This method was removed in r14032 (bug 8562), but Safari 2.0 still uses it.

        Private extensions to the WebPlugin interface.  A plugin may implement these methods to receive loading callbacks
        for its main resource.  Plug-ins that implement this SPI show better loading progress in the browser, can be saved
        to disk, and are more efficient by avoiding making duplicate GET or POST requests for the plug-in's main resource.

        I want to provide a solid API for plug-in networking, but time constraints require that I first provide this simple
        SPI for internal clients.

        * Plugins/WebPluginViewFactoryPrivate.h:
        Added a new plugin argument, WebPlugInShouldLoadMainResourceKey.  If YES, the plugin is responsible
        for loading its own content.  If NO, the plugin should wait for WebKit to send it the data via the
        new request-sharing SPI.

        * Plugins/WebPluginPrivate.h: Added.
        Request-sharing SPI.  See comments in code.

        * Plugins/WebPluginDocumentView.h:
        Hang onto the plugin view as an ivar so we can call the new resource loading methods on it.
        * Plugins/WebPluginDocumentView.m:
        (-[WebPluginDocumentView dealloc]):
        Release pluginView ivar.
        (-[WebPluginDocumentView setDataSource:]):
        Pass NO for WebPlugInShouldLoadMainResourceKey to indicate to the plugin that it should not 
        load its own main resource -- the data will come from WebKit.  This is only necessary for plugin
        documents.  By the time we create the view for a plugin document, we already have fetched some
        of its main resource's data.  Embedded plugins do not have this issue because WebKit is not
        involved in loading their content.
        Call -webPlugInMainResourceDidReceivResponse: on the plugin if necessary.  This lets the plugin
        know how much and what kind of data is going to be received.
        (-[WebPluginDocumentView dataSourceUpdated:]):
        If the plugin implements the new request-sharing SPI, don't cancel the in-progress request.
        (-[WebPluginDocumentView receivedData:withDataSource:]):
        Forward to the plugin via the new request-sharing SPI.
        (-[WebPluginDocumentView receivedError:withDataSource:]):

        In addition to letting WebIconDatabase recover from disk/memory mismatches as per 4507054, I also found
        a bug in the way icons are remembered that could account for some of the other cases where

        the icon again (short of removing the entire icon database cleanly). Note that this does *not* change
        the behavior of sites that didn't have a site icon when WebKit checked -- these will continue to not

        - Fixed the load progress indicator to give more incremental feedback, 
        and to stop spending so much time near 100%.

        I did two things:
        (1) Fixed some bugs and a misspelling in the previous heuristic's 
        implementation
        (2) Added two new rules to the heuristic:
            (a) Treat the first layout as the half-way point.
            (b) Just like we jump the first 10% to indicate that a load has
            started, jump the last 10% to indicate that a load has finished.

        Rule 2a is good for two reasons. First, it seems unnatural for loading
        to be "more than half done" when you can't even see anything. Second,
        in the early stages of laading our estimate of how much we'll need to
        load is often off by as much as 6000% (e.g., cnn.com). So anything that
        makes the progress indicator more conservative in the early stages of 
        loading is helpful.

        Rule 2b is good because it's confusing for loading to be "100% done"
        but still ongoing.

        FIXME: The indicator still isn't perfect. For example, the old behavior
        shows up @ moviefone.com. Two areas for future work:
        (1) Estimate number of linked resources. Our code estimates the size
        of a single resource, but does nothing to estimate the number of
        resources that resource might link to. This is the key to why we're
        so wrong at the beginning.
        (2) Improve "when to do first layout" heuristic. A JavaScript query
        for a style property forces layout, creating a phantom first layout 
        with no content, essentially nullifying 2a for certain pages.
        
        Filed <rdar://problem/4475834> to track estimating the number of 
        linked resources. Phantom layouts are already on Hyatt's radar.

        (2) Bug fix: only update the 'last time I sent a notification' time if 
        we actually send a notification.
        (3) Don't test for progress < 0 because ensuring progress < max
        also ensures max - progress > 0. (Do still test for progress > max 
        because rounding errors make that a possibility -- although a very 
        minor one.)
        (4) Query only the loading frame and its subframes for pending
        requests instead of defaulting to the main frame. This is a slight
        optimization in cases where the main frame did not begin the load,
        and it makes the code more consistent.

        Some stream teardown logic changed with my fix to 4153419: when a WebBaseNetscapePluginStream is destroyed,
        it now clears its NPP instance backpointer.  The WebBaseNetscapePluginStream may be destroyed from within
        -startStreamWithResponse: if NPP_NewStream() returns an error.  We can handle this gracefully by changing

        This is unrelated to the Radar, but prior to this fix, we would attempt an NPP_Write() with the initial

        <rdar://problem/4153419> CrashTracer: 576 crashes in Safari at com.apple.WebKit: NPN_DestroyStream + 56

        I never could reproduce this crasher, which seems to be caused by the Speed Download plugin.  However,
        I did find a way to make the affected code more bulletproof for those who are experiencing the crash.
        
        * Plugins/WebBaseNetscapePluginStream.h:
        Keep a WebBaseNetscapePluginView instead of the WebNetscapePluginPackage, since the plugin view could
        potentially be deallocated before the stream finishes loading.
        * Plugins/WebBaseNetscapePluginStream.m:
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream _pluginCancelledConnectionError]):
        Use pluginView instead of plugin.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream dealloc]):
        Assert that the plugin instance has been nulled out, since that's now part of the stream's teardown
        phase.
        Release pluginView instead of plugin.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream setPluginPointer:]):
        Retain the plugin view instead of the plugin package, since the plugin view could be deallocated while
        the stream is running.
        This method now accepts a NULL argument so that we can easily clear out the pluginView backpointer
        (and other ivars derived from it).
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream startStreamResponseURL:expectedContentLength:lastModifiedDate:MIMEType:]):
        Use pluginView instead of plugin.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream _destroyStream]):
        ditto
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream finishedLoadingWithData:]):
        ditto
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream cancelLoadAndDestroyStreamWithError]):
        Set the plugin instance to NULL, so that the pluginView backpointer is released.  This method is called
        for every plugin view's stream when the plugin view is stopped/destroyed.
        (-[WebBaseNetscapePluginStream _deliverData]):
        Use pluginView instead of plugin.
