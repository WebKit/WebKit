/* This file is mostly data generated by flex. Unfortunately flex
   can't handle 16bit strings directly, so we just copy the part of
   the code we need and modify it to our needs.

   Most of the defines below are to make sure we can easily use the
   flex generated code, using as little editing as possible.

   The flex syntax to generate the lexer are more or less directly
   copied from the CSS2.1 specs, with some fixes for comments and
   the important symbol.

   To regenerate, run flex on tokenizer.flex. After this, copy the
   data tables and the YY_DECL method over to this file. Remove the
   init code from YY_DECL and change the YY_END_OF_BUFFER to only call
   yyterminate().
