        <p>Test for onevent shadowing in WML</p>
        <p>The card-level onevent will shadow the deck-level onevent. As a result, card 1 won't jump to card2 but
           to card 3 according to the card-level onevent's requirement. After entered the card 3, the deck-level onevent
           element isn't shadowed by this card, so it will jump to card 2 immediately.</p>
    </card>

    <card id="card2" title="Card two" onenterforward="">
        <p>This is card 2</p>
    </card>

    <card id="card3" title="Card Three">
        <p>This is card 3</p>
    </card>
