	Fix for 3507164, scrolling really slow on hixie's web forms spec page.  Hixie has 12 little transparent layers
        at various points on this page, and beginning/ending transparency on only those 12 layers as you scroll
        is enough to kill scrolling performance.

	This patch works around the issue by lazily beginning transparency layers only when we determine that
	we're actually painting a descendant layer of a transparent ancestor or a transparent layer.

	Also fixing QColor's comparison operator.  It was broken and not comparing the "valid" bit, so invalid and
	valid colors were being assumed to be the same.

	Also fixed the render dumper to not dump transparent and invalid background colors and fixed it do dump the
	alpha for colors with an alpha < 0xFF.

	Fix for 3503652, news.com misrenders badly (footer is out of position).  My fix to 3495748 caused this
	regression.  I made the tag priority of <nobr> too high.  It needed to be the same as <div>, and I
	accidentally made it higher.  I intended for it to be the same as <div>.

	I also had to make a fix (now that <nobr> has a higher priority) to ensure <nobr> can't be nested inside
	other <nobr>.  

	Both fixes were required to make news.com render correctly again.

Fixed parameter passing to applet.  Child elements are NOT valid in setStyle().  So we now either create the widget before needed with createWidgetIfNecessary.  This either happens when doing the first layout, or when JavaScript first references the applet element.

Fixed early delete of the the main applet instance.  When the JS collector cleaned up the last JS object referring to the applet instance we were deleting the java instance.  This caused the applet instance cached on the applet element to be invalid.  The applet instance is the only Java object not to be cleaned up by the JS collector.

Added support for getting at Java object fields.

        * khtml/html/html_formimpl.cpp:
        (HTMLInputElementImpl::defaultEventHandler): Remove checks for "U+00000d" since we now use "Enter"
        for that key; also, we use capitalized hex, so it would have to change to "U+00000D" anyway.
        (HTMLSelectElementImpl::defaultEventHandler): Ditto.
        * khtml/html/html_inlineimpl.cpp: (HTMLAnchorElementImpl::defaultEventHandler): Ditto.

        * khtml/khtmlview.cpp: (KHTMLView::keyPressEvent): Put !APPLE_CHANGES around code we are not
        using. It was doing a switch based on Qt key codes, but the key value it was using to check
        was a Macintosh virtual key code, which could yield strange results when the codes happen to
        match. Safer and smaller code size not to do any of it at all.

        * khtml/rendering/render_form.cpp:
        (RenderLineEdit::RenderLineEdit): Use a KLineEdit instead of LineEditWidget for APPLE_CHANGES.
        Allows us to put !APPLE_CHANGES around more Qt key code stuff.
        (RenderLineEdit::select): Cast to KLineEdit instead of LineEditWidget.
        (ComboBoxWidget::event): Put !APPLE_CHANGES around more unneeded Qt key code stuff.
        (TextAreaWidget::event): Put !APPLE_CHANGES around more unneeded Qt key code stuff.

        * khtml/xml/dom2_eventsimpl.h: Made id() const and added keyCode() and charCode().
        * khtml/xml/dom2_eventsimpl.cpp:
        (KeyboardEventImpl::KeyboardEventImpl): Initialize all fields in the empty constructor.
        Initialize all the modifier bits in the main constructor; the old code assumed they started
        off false, which is not a safe assumption. Also set m_altGraphKey false. Eliminated the
        unneeded check of text() before calling identifier(). Also adapted for the name change from
        identifier() to keyIdentifier().
        (KeyboardEventImpl::keyCode): Added. Returns the Windows virtual key code for keydown and
        keyup events, and the Unicode character for all other events.
        (KeyboardEventImpl::charCode): Added. Returns the Unicode character.

        * kwq/KWQEvent.h: Changed QCustomEvent to be a typedef for QEvent.
        (QEvent::QEvent): Removed AccelAvailable, and added KParts, so I could remove some ugly
        constants from the KParts code.
        (QMouseEvent::button): Use a cast here since the field is now int.
        (QMouseEvent::state): Use a cast here since the field is now int.
        (QMouseEvent::stateAfter): Use a cast here since the field is now int, and use the new
        _stateAfter field.
        (QTimerEvent::QTimerEvent): Moved the constructor to be inline since it's so simple.
        (QKeyEvent::QKeyEvent): Removed type and button state parameters, now unneeded.
        Also removed now-unused _key, _ascii, and _count fields, and key(), ascii(),
        and count() functions.
        (QKeyEvent::state): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::isAccepted): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::text): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::isAutoRepeat): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::accept): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::ignore): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::unmodifiedText): Made inline.
        (QKeyEvent::keyIdentifier): Made inline and chnaged name from identifier().
        * kwq/KWQEvent.mm:
        (keyIdentifierForKeyEvent): Renamed from identifierForKeyText and changed parameter
        to be the event. Cleaned up the code a little bit, and wrote a comment or two.
        Changed from lowercase hex to uppercase, and called toupper on the key so that
        letter a-z would work properly. (A non-Unicode toupper is just the ticket here,
        because I am only sure we want to do this for a-z, not other lowercase characters.)
        (isKeypadEvent): Added. Uses virtual key codes to decide if a key event is a keypad
        event, so we can set the state flag correctly.
        (WindowsKeyCodeForKeyEvent): Added Clear key to the switch statement; it was missing.
        Changed to no longe use the characterCode helper function since this was the only
        place it was needed.
        (mouseButtonForEvent): Added. Similar logic to what was in KWQKHTMLPart before; better
        factoring to have it in here.
        (nonMouseButtonsForEvent): Ditto.
        (QMouseEvent::QMouseEvent): Rewrote constructors. One matches the one from Qt that's
        used in some places in KHTML code. The other takes an NSEvent and uses the new functions
        above to compute the button and state.
        (QKeyEvent::QKeyEvent): Computer type based on the passed-in NSEvent. Compute the
        auto-repeat flag based on the event and also the "forceAutoRepeat" parameter. Compute
        the button state based on the event too.

        * kwq/KWQKHTMLPart.h: Remove buttonForCurrentEvent and stateForCurrentEvent. Both
        are now in KWQEvent.mm.
        * kwq/KWQKHTMLPart.mm:
        (KWQKHTMLPart::keyEvent): Remove extra parameters in code that creates QKeyEvent, now
        that QKeyEvent can handle everything itself.
        (KWQKHTMLPart::mouseDown): Same thing as above, only for QMouseEvent.
        (KWQKHTMLPart::mouseDragged): Ditto.
        (KWQKHTMLPart::mouseUp): Ditto.
        (KWQKHTMLPart::mouseMoved): Ditto.
        (KWQKHTMLPart::sendContextMenuEvent): Ditto.

        * kwq/KWQKPartsEvent.h: Tweaked the class around a little so it can work without
        taking advantage of QCustomEvent's data pointer.
        * kwq/KWQKPartsEvent.mm:
        (KParts::Event::Event): Changed so it does a strdup on the event name and uses the
        new event type pre-allocated in KWQEvent.h for us.
        (KParts::Event::~Event): Free the event name.
        (KParts::Event::test): Reimplemented this.

        * kwq/KWQKPartsPart.h: (KParts::Part::event): Removed now-unnecessary cast to change
        a QCustomEvent into a QEvent.

        * kwq/KWQNamespace.h: Removed the Qt::Key enum. All the code that used it was already
        broken because of the mixup between Qt and Macintosh key codes.

	3485717, Cleanup of the float code.  Eliminated the -khtml-flow-mode style property in favor of two simple methods,
	avoidsFloats() and usesLineWidth().  avoidsFloats can be called to tell whether an object does not want
	floats to intrude into its space (and that it should also move to avoid floats).  usesLineWidth is called
	to find out if an object's containing block width is the line width or the content width, and has all the
	right smarts to emulate WinIE's behaviors in both quirks and strict mode.

	Also fixed a bug (3485718) where overflow:scroll blocks with auto height did not factor in the horizontal scrollbar's
	height (thus causing it to paint on top of content).

	Fix for 3485260, regression on Uniview site from incremental repainting.  When appending/inserting child
	nodes into the render tree, we need to always mark them as needing layout themselves (and not just as
	having children needing layout).  This ensures that the incremental repainting code will know to repaint the
	enclosing container (even though that container's size may not change).

	Fix for 3411960, block-level replaced elements should avoid floats.

	Fix for 3463234, floats should not intrude into overflow blocks (even when siblings happen to get in
	between the float and the overflow block).

	Fix for 3485576, the containing block for text runs is incorrect.

	Fix for 3485577, text runs should not trigger layout when style is re-resolved.

	In addition to fixing the bug, I also did a bit of cleanup

	Biggest change is to modify the keyboard UI mode function so

	This regression has been in the tree for a couple of versions now,

	is to ask the text input manager if it has any marked text when

	needs to work in the "accept" role for the input manager. Fixing
	in this way has the pleasant effect of making return/enter key

        - fixed 3478173 -- REGRESSION (112-113): getElementById is failing for many types of elements

        derived from ElementImpl. By changing them all to call up to their base classes instead of

	Fix for 3466628, widgets in overflow blocks don't move when the overflow block is scrolled.  This
	was a regression caused by my change to move widgets only during layout and not at paint time.  The
	problem with this is that scrolling an overflow block doesn't do a layout, just a repaint.  I patched
	the layer code to update widget positions on an overflow block scroll.

	This then exposed a bug in absolutePosition, namely that the scroll offset was never factored in when
	computing absolutePosition.  This bug also explains why text selection and cursor display were wrong
	inside scrolled overflow blocks.

	Implement support for <marquee>.  This includes support for the CSS3 specification (although modified a fair
	bit to actually be compatible with WinIE's version and to correct obvious errors in the draft).  All of the
	marquee behaviors (slide, scroll, and alternate) are supported.

	This patch also fixes the following bugs that were discovered while testing marquee:
	(1) An error in the computation of scrollWidth and scrollHeight.  
	(2) The ability to ask for the leftmostPosition as well as the rightmostPosition of content and to
	be able to ask for the positions of children (via left/right/lowest) without including the parent in the
	computation.
	(3) An optimization to RenderFlow's rightmost/lowestPosition functions to avoid examining text elements since
	they are always fully accounted for by either overflow or by inline flow boxes.
	(4) A fix for RTL rendering.  A block with direction:RTL was being placed on the right, when in reality only
	its children should be placed on the right.
	(5) A fix to prevent inline blocks and tables from computing auto margins (making them just like floats in this
	regard).
