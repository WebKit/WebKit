About kdelibs
-------------
This is version 2.2 of the KDE libraries.

This package includes libraries that are central to the development and 
execution of a KDE program, as well as internationalization files for these 
libraries, misc HTML documentation, theme modules, and regression tests. 
Here is a list:

* kdecore
    This is the core collection of KDE stuff. Non GUI classes reside here.

* kdeui
    The main collection of misc. user interface classes (widgets).

* kimgio
    An all purpose extension to the qimgio class that supports some obscure
    image formats.

* kfile
    This library contains the KFileDialog in all its glory.

* kspell
    KSpell and related classes are a frontend to ispell for use within a
    GUI app.

* kab
    The address book library.

* khtml
    The next generation HTML rendering widget designed for Konqueror
    (kfm's successor). This supports HTML 4, CSS, and a variety of other web
    related standards.

* kio
    Classes that fetch and decode URLs are contained here. This library also
    contains "ksycoca", the system configure cache containing services,
    applications, servicetypes and mimetypes.

* kjs
    KDE's implementation of ECMAScript (aka JavaScript).

* kparts
    KDE component model.

* kstyles
    The theme engine lies within. It handles nearly anything relating to
    customizing the appearance of widgets.

* dcop
    The desktop communication program allows even shell scripts to communicate
    with KDE applications. It's also the base for KParts.

* kssl
    An SSL intergration for KDE. It currently uses OpenSSL.

* arts
    ARTS (analog realtime synthesizer) is a environment of small modules
    that one can plug together to process multimedia data.

* kdesu
    Library for password entering and handling

* kinit
    Process launcher, used for fast KDE startup

* ksgmltools
    Docbook and SGML tools needed to generate documentation for KDE.

* libkmid
    MIDI file handling and midi mapper (manages output of midi files to
    various devices).

* interfaces
    kparts interface for text editors

* libtldl
    System independed dlopen() handler.

* mimetypes
    Database of mime types.

* pics
    Database of icons.

* libkscreensaver
    Library for making KDE screensavers.

Licensing
---------
The libraries themselves have been covered (since Saturday, June 21st, 1997)
by the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL). Any other programs (such as
the examples) are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL). All the
gory details for the LGPL reside in COPYING.LIB, and for the GPL reside in 
COPYING.

Various parts are also covered under a BSD style license, detailed in
COPYING.BSD. Currently, code covered under such license is copyrighted by
Theo de Raadt.

When in doubt, check the individual file, they should all have license
headings and other identifying marks.


Common Mistakes
---------------
If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 2.2.3 or newer. If you have peeked there
already, grab the CVS module qt-copy from anoncvs.kde.org, or a snapshot
thereof.


Debugging
---------
You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE libs. If you have the space and can stand code that's
somewhat slower, this is worth it. The extra information really
helps debugging and thus bugfixing.

On the other hand, --disable-debug removes all debug messages, leading
to a faster and cleaner desktop.

See also the file DEBUG.


Upgrading
---------
If you have an kdebase older than 2.0 installed, just copy all your .k*rc
files from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/share/config. In the other case, default
values are used for most apps.


Compile Problems
----------------
Often, KDE compile failures are not KDE's faults but the one of the
compiler or the distribution used. For that reason, please have a look at
http://www.kde.org/compilationfaq.html for know issues in certain OS
environments before reporting bugs or going mad :). 

gcc 3.0 is not yet able to compile all of KDE without errors, mostly due
to bugs in this version of the compiler. Some older version of gcc 2.96
also have problems compiling KDE due to compiler bugs. Even though 
compilation may not report errors with these compiler, the usage of these
compilers may cause crashes when using the resulting executables.

If you are running a FreeBSD system, you will need to make sure that LIBS
is set to "-Wl,-export-dynamic". The easiest way to do this is to prefix
configure with it, i.e.: LIBS="-Wl,-export-dynamic" ./configure. Thanks to
Will Andrews <will@FreeBSD.org> and Arun Sharma <adsharma@sharmas.dhs.org>
for identifying what needed to be done, and how to do it, and such.

If you get odd error such as:

as: Error: /var/tmp/ccK1Cfxa.s, line 2827: Truncating token:

and you're using egcs, try re-compiling all your C++ libs with -fsquangle,
and then recompiling whatever you were working on with -fsquangle. It
should help, and more information about this is available on the egcs FAQ
available at http://egcs.cygnus.com


How to report
-------------
Reporting bugs is an art. Why?  Because bug reports can help and hinder.

They hinder if the developers are just buried in an avanche of bug reports.
They spend hours figuring out which bug reports are valid and which non,
which bug reports are due to bugs or due to installation problems.

They can be a tremendous help to notify developers on problems in areas that
they normally don't have access (e.g. KDE on AIX) to.

So, here are some tips on bug reporting:

* make sure your bug is due to KDE ... and not due to a packaging problem of
  your Linux distrubutor. For example, most "I can not install the XYZ.rpm"
  problem are due to packaging issues. Refer with such questions to your
  Linux Distributor and his appropriate mailing list or bug reporting tool.

* The chance is high that your bug has already been dealt with ... so look
  if there is a newer version of kdelibs available. Reporting bugs for
  older, deprecated versions usually don't get that much attention :-)

* Also the chance is high that another one experienced your problem. The
  bug report wizard at http://bugs.kde.org will help you to find out if your
  problem has already been reported.

* The best bug report for a project based on voluntary work is of course one
  that comes with a patch that solves the problem. :-)


More info
---------
http://www.kde.org is a good starting point for info on KDE. If you are a
developer, you may also point your browser to http://developer.kde.org.
There is a plethora of mailing lists available, you can gain an overview
quickly by looking at http://lists.kde.org.
