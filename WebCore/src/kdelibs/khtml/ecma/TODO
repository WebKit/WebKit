Has to be done
==============
- frame[] correct search and sorting order (DONE ?)
- optional error message output
- set this.form in event handlers of form elements (DONE ?)
- change KParts::WindowArgs && friends 
  that we can detect if a locationbar is on/or not

Could be done
=============
- Make the graphical debugger useable
- Improve internal structures to give a really useful
  output on errors (i.e. improve backtrance capabilities)
