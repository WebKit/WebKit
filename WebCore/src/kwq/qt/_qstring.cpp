/*! \class QCharRef qstring.h
  \brief The QCharRef class is a helper class for QString.

  It provides the ability to work on characters in a QString in a natural
  fashion.

  When you get an object of type QCharRef, you can assign to it, which
  will operate on the string from which you got it.  That is its whole
  purpose in life.  It becomes invalid once further modifications are
  made to the string: If you want to keep it, copy it into a QChar.

  Most of the QChar member functions also exist in QCharRef.  However,
  they are not explicitly documented here.

  \sa QString::operator[]() QString::at() QChar

/*! \class QChar qstring.h

\brief The QChar class provides a light-weight Unicode character.

Unicode characters are (so far) 16-bit entities without any markup or
structure.  This class represents such an entity.  It is rather
light-weight, so it can be used everywhere.  Most compilers treat it
approximately like "short int".  (In a few years, it may be necessary
to make QChar 32-bit, once more than 65536 Unicode code points have
been defined and come into use.)

QChar provides a full complement of testing/classification functions,
conversion to and from other formats, from composed to decomposed
unicode, and will try to compare and case-convert if you ask it to.

The classification functions include functions like those in ctype.h,
but operating on the full range of unicode characters.  They all
return TRUE if the character is a certain type of character, and FALSE
otherwise.

These functions are: isNull() (returns TRUE if the character is
U+0000), isPrint() (TRUE if the character is any sort of printable
character, including whitespace), isPunct() (any sort of punctation),
isMark() (Unicode Marks), isLetter (letters), isNumber() (any sort of
numeric characters), isLetterOrNumber(),  and isDigit() (decimal digits).
All of these are wrappers around category(), which returns the
unicode-defined category of each character.

QChar further provides direction(), which indicates the "natural"
writing direction of this character, joining(), which indicates how
this character joins with its neighbors (needed mostly for Arabic)
and finally mirrored(), which indicates whether this character needs
to be mirrored when it is printed in its unnatural writing
direction.

Composed Unicode characters (like &aring;) can be converted to
decomposed Unicode ("a" followed by "ring above") using
decomposition().

In Unicode, comparison is not necessarily possible, and case
conversion is at best very hard.  Unicode, covering the "entire"
globe, also includes a globe-sized collection of case and sorting
problems.  Qt tries, but not very hard: operator== and friends will do
comparison based purely on the numeric Unicode value (code point) of
the characters, and upper() and lower() will do case changes when the
character has a well-defined upper/lower-case equivalent. There is no
provision for locale-dependent case folding rules or comparison: These
functions are meant to be fast, so they can be used unambiguously in
data structures.

The conversion functions include unicode() (to a scalar), latin1() (to
scalar, but converts all non-Latin1 characters to 0), row() (gives the
Unicode row), cell() (gives the unicode cell), digitValue() (gives the
integer value of any of the numerous digit characters), and a host of
constructors.

  \class QString qstring.h

  \brief The QString class provides an abstraction of Unicode text and
	  the classic C null-terminated char array (<var>char*</var>).

  \ingroup tools
  \ingroup shared

  QString uses \link shclass.html implicit sharing\endlink, and so it
  is very efficient and easy to use.

  In all QString methods that take <var>const char*</var> parameters,
  the <var>const char*</var> is interpreted as a classic C-style
  0-terminated ASCII string. It is legal for the <var>const
  char*</var> parameter to be 0. The results are undefined if the
  <var>const char*</var> string is not 0-terminated. Functions that
  copy classic C strings into a QString will not copy the terminating
  0-character. The QChar array of the QString (as returned by
  unicode()) is not terminated by a null.

  A QString that has not been assigned to anything is \a null, i.e. both
  the length and data pointer is 0. A QString that references the empty
  string ("", a single '\0' char) is \a empty.	Both null and empty
  QStrings are legal parameters to the methods. Assigning <var>const char
  * 0</var> to QString gives a null QString.

  Note that if you find that you are mixing usage of QCString, QString,
  and QByteArray, this causes lots of unnecessary copying and might
  indicate that the true nature of the data you are dealing with is
  uncertain.  If the data is NUL-terminated 8-bit data, use QCString;
  if it is unterminated (ie. contains NULs) 8-bit data, use QByteArray;
  if it is text, use QString.
