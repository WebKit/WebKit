        GraphicsContext: Merge m_common and m_data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49914

        Move data members from GraphicsContextPrivate into GraphicsContext. So GraphicsContextPlatform.h
        and m_common became unnecessary. They are removed.
        Add two methods to GraphicsContext: platformInit() and platformDestroy(), which
        make the constructor of GraphicsContext clearer.
        Besides add a getter to the private GraphicsContext::m_state member, because some inline
        functions in cairo need it.

        No new test is needed, because this is a refactoring.

        RenderIndicator subclasses should not change the render tree during layout.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50026

        The old code created shadow elements during a layout computation,
        that makes the layout state inconsisntent and cause an assertion failure. 
        This change created shadow elements before the layout to avoid  
        state inconsistencies.
        
        Instead of creating shadows on demand, RenderMeter and
        RenderProgress now create all necessary shadows before layouts,
        and change its visibilities during the layout: Changing
        visibilities doesn't trigger relayout and keep the state
        consistent.
        
        RenderMeter uses new HidablePartElement for shadow elements,
        which can toggle visibiliby between hidden and original value.

        returning to a POST result within a frame does a GET instead of a POST
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10199
        
        FrameLoader::loadURLIntoChildFrame had a check for whether a frame
        had a HistoryItem, and if so used that item's URL. However, that did
        not handle the case where the HistoryItem had FormData and thus was the
        result of a POST request. FrameLoader::navigateToDifferentDocument (now
        renamed to loadDifferentDocumentItem) does all that, so just switch to
        using it instead.
        
        Besides the bug fix, the only difference in behavior is that we use the
        HistoryItem's URL instead of original URL when restoring it in a child
        frame. This seems desirable too (for consistency with other browsers, and
        so that we can avoid form double-submits for forms that that do
        POST-then-redirect), and is tested by
        fast/history/history-back-initial-vs-final-url.html.

        Spatial navigation not Working for Map and Area Tags
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47142

        Give area elements special treatment in spatial navigation algorithm by getting the
        rect of the area from the associated image. Since area elements are likely to overlap
        if they are not rects, or if authors are not careful, we flatten the rect of area elements.

        Executing FormatBlock on multiple paragraphs inside pre does not remove the outer pre
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47300

        The bug was caused by FormatBlockCommand::formatRange's not removing refNode when the refNode
        contains more than one paragraphs even when the refNode is fully selected.

        Fixed the bug by modifying FormatBlockCommand::formatRange to correctly remove the node in

        Fix for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49220 <<rdar://problem/8644849>, REGRESSION: transforms now
        O(n^3) from pathological behavior in lowestPosition, rightmostPosition, leftmostPosition and topmostPosition.

        This patch throws out the lowest/rightmost/leftmost/topmostPosition functions and re-architects layout overflow
        in the engine to cache all the information required to properly handle scrolling.

        In the old code, there were two types of overflow: layout overflow and visual overflow.  The former could
        affect scrolling and the latter could not.  The distinction was largely meaningless, since layout overflow
        wasn't actually used to determine scroll width or scroll height.  It didn't propagate across self-painting layer
        boundaries either.  In the old code, the term visible overflow meant the union of the layout overflow and
        visual overflow rects.

        In the new code, the two types of overflow remain, but the distinction between the two is now clear.  Visual overflow
        is used purely for painting and hit testing checks and layout overflow is used specifically for scrolling.  It has
        been expanded to propagate across self-painting layers, to factor in relative positioning and transforms, and to
        work with writing modes.

        In order to minimize layout test changes, layers no longer incorporate right/bottom overflow into their width/height members.
        Doing so uncovered two bugs where left/top overflow was ignored (proof that even having layer dimensions is harmful).
        A render tree dump hack has been put into the code to keep this overflow dumping for the RenderView's layer, since otherwise
        a huge number of tests would change.

        Added fast/overflow/overflow-rtl-vertical.html to test vertical writing-mode overflow.  Existing tests cover the rest.

        Blocks now have a computeOverflow function called at the end of layout that adds in all the types of overflow.  The addOverflowFromChildren
        method is virtual so that RenderListItem and RenderTable can subclass it.  RenderListItem has to position its list marker and
        propagate marker overflow up, and RenderTable adds in overflow from its sections.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::addOverhangingFloats):

            (2) The float must be a descendant to contribute to overflow.
            (3) The block must have the outermost list that contains the float, or it has a self-painting layer and
                so the float needs to be included in its overflow.

        tests change.  (Not doing this makes the layout test changes far worse, since overflow propagates across self-painting
        layers now.)

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowTop):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowBottom):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowLeft):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowRight):

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::updateScrollInfoAfterLayout):

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::hitTest):

        Added the new overflowTop/Left/Right/Bottom accessors.

        (WebCore::RenderListItem::addOverflowFromChildren):
        (WebCore::RenderListItem::positionListMarker):
        * rendering/RenderListItem.h:
        RenderListItem now positions the list marker when computing its overflow, since the marker propagates overflow back up to the list item.

        * rendering/RenderListMarker.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderListMarker::paint):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderMarquee.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderMarquee::computePosition):
        Changed to use overflow functions instead of rightmost/lowestPosition.

        * rendering/RenderMedia.cpp:
        * rendering/RenderMedia.h:
        Removed the lowest/topmost/rightmost/leftmostPosition functions, since control overflow is handled properly already.

        * rendering/RenderOverflow.h:
        (WebCore::RenderOverflow::RenderOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderOverflow::setLayoutOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderOverflow::setVisualOverflow):
        Add new setters for layout and visual overflow as rects.

        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderRubyRun.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderRubyRun::layout):
        Call computeOverflow to recompute our overflow information after we adjust the ruby.

        (WebCore::RenderTable::layout):
        (WebCore::RenderTable::addOverflowFromChildren):
        (WebCore::RenderTable::paint):
        * rendering/RenderTable.h:
        Move section overflow propagation into addOverflowFromChildren, and change RenderTable to just call computeOverflow.

        * rendering/RenderTableCell.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTableCell::clippedOverflowRectForRepaint):
        visible -> visual.

        (WebCore::RenderTableCell::scrollbarsChanged):
        Adding unreachable overflow support (something that in the old code only existed for positioned objects in the root view) exposed
        a bug in table layout.  If scrollbars are added during the layout that occurs after intrinsic padding was incorporated into the
        cell, then the cell won't lay out properly the second time (after the scrollbars have been added).  We have to adjust the intrinsic
        padding accounting for the presence of the new scrollbar so the second layout will get the right dimensions.

        * rendering/RenderTableCell.h:
        (WebCore::RenderTableCell::hasVisualOverflow):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderTableSection.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTableSection::layoutRows):
        * rendering/RenderTableSection.h:
        visible -> visual.  Removed the leftmost/rightmost/topmost/bottommostPosition functions.

        * rendering/RenderTreeAsText.cpp:
        (WebCore::writeLayers):
        Added a hack to render tree dumping to include right/bottom overflow for the root layer only.  This keeps a zillion layout tests
        from failing.

        * rendering/RenderView.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderView::layout):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docTop):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docBottom):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docLeft):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docRight):
        * rendering/RenderView.h:
        (WebCore::RenderView::docHeight):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docWidth):
        RenderView now uses docLeft/Top/Height/Width functions, which are just overflow queries that account for writing modes.  These methods
        are now the preferred way to query for the physical dimensions of a document.

        * rendering/RootInlineBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::RootInlineBox::addHighlightOverflow):
        Changed to call setOverflowFromLogicalRects instead of the block/inline position functions.

        (WebCore::RootInlineBox::alignBoxesInBlockDirection):
        Remove the computation of block direction overflow, since it now all happens at once after the line is built.

        (WebCore::RootInlineBox::paddedLayoutOverflowRect):
        * rendering/RootInlineBox.h:
        Added a new helper function for incorporating the end padding into a line.  This end padding also includes the single pixel for a caret
        in LTR if needed.

        Share code between Mac (CA) and Windows (CACF) GraphicsLayer implementations
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49388

        Replaced GraphicsLayerMac with GraphicsLayerCA. GraphicsLayerCA is essentially 
        identical to GraphicsLayerMac, but replaces all the CoreAnimation specific calls 
        with calls to PlatformCALayer and PlatformCAAnimation. This makes GraphicsLayerCA 
        platform neutral as long as implementations of those two classes are available. 
        Added implementations in PlatformCALayerMac and PlatformCAAnimationMac. Also got 
        rid of GraphicsLayer::nativeLayer() and replaced it with GraphicsLayer::platformLayer() 
        to avoid confusion since both names were used to refer to the same thing. 

        This patch is only for Mac. Windows implementation has not changed.
