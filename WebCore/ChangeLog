        <rdar://5548217>: [NTS] Java 6 update 3 crashes Safari when loading a

        <rdar://5548217>: [NTS] Java 6 update 3 crashes Safari when loading a 
        java page

        We purposefully do not destroy our Java VM when its reference count
        reaches 0, but we were unloading our JavaPlugin.dll when its reference
        count reached 0, which lost the reference to the VM. This led to our
        process trying to create a new VM the next time a page using Java was
        loaded, and the JNI spec states that a single process is not allowed to
        create more than one VM. The fix is to avoid unloading the Java plugin
        via our PluginQuirkDontUnloadPlugin.

        Bug 15574: Web Inspector doesn't work with the new Database feature

        The executeSql callback is executed in the security domain of the web page that owns the database,
        while the inspector's window object is in the callback functions scope chain.  This is leading to a
        security violation when the callback attempts to access "document".  We can work around this by

        The specification is still in flux but the fundamentals are pretty solid and we can start using and testing 
        this implementation even while filing bugs to track changes in the spec as it becomes more final

        There are some implementation details in this patch that seem unused or useless, but they remain in place

2007-10-15  David Hyatt  <hyatt@apple.com>

        The CSS WG has been discussing the concept of rotation.  In the latest draft specification, two properties
        have been introduced: rotation and rotation-point.  I believe these properties should be generalized to
        allow for arbitrary transformations (e.g., translation, skew, rotate, scale).

        This patch adds support for the back-end parsing of two new CSS properties: transform and transform-origin.
        They are directly analogous to the properties specified by the CSS WG, except that they are designed to allow
        for arbitrary affine transforms rather than just rotation.

        Fix bad abstraction in ImageBuffer class.
        While the class itself is platform-aware and thus it's location in platform/graphics
        is fine, it contains the "renderSubtreeToImage" method which operates on RenderObject.

        As it's SVG specific I decided to move this method into SVGRenderSupport, to avoid
        implicit platform/ <-> rendering/ dependencies.

          <rdar://problem/5474647>

        Test: fast/forms/button-text-transform.html

        Text transformations require access to the original text. The button's inner
        text was an anonymous RenderText, meaning it did not have a node to retrieve
        the original text from. The patch fixes this by changing the inner text into a
        RenderTextFragment, which stores its own original text.
