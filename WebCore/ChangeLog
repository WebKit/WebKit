        Simplify the interaction between LocalStorageArea/SessionStorageArea
        and StorageArea by creating a "blockUntilImportComplete()" function
        rather than bouncing back and forth between the child and parent
        classes in a somewhat unintuitive manner.

        This patch also paves the way for LocalStorageArea and
        SessionStorageArea being merged into one.  It's part of several in a
        set which are separating syncing (to disk) code from the rest of the
        implementation so that local storage and session storage's code can be
        unified.

        Fix NPAPI mouse translation issues on Mac

        The WindowRef we pass to the plugin refers to the the top level window,
        so the x and y positions have to be relative to this position, but we
        have to manually compensate for title bar decorations and other parents
        of the QWebView since contentsToWindow() only traverses to the QWebView.

        Previously we did this compensation when passing on mouse coordinates to
        the plugin, which caused various issues with translations such as not
        being able to close the Flash settings dialog, or the hand cursor not
        appearing over links.

        We now do the compensation as part of the call to NPP_SetWindow, and
        then pass mouse coordinates in global context without any compensation,
        similar to how both Safari and Mozilla does it.

        <rdar://problem/6956606> REGRESSION (S4Beta -> Final): After the password is input,
        Japanese can't be input.

        WebKit uses a per-frame input context for most editable fields, and application's global
        context for password fields, manually controlling secure input state and the list of available
        input sources.

        We were setting TSMDocument property to disable non-Roman input methods after focus changed
        to a password field, but before selection was updated. This resulted in the property being
        applied to a wrong TSMDocument in some cases, because TSMGetActiveDocument() uses input
        context cached by +[NSApplication updateWindows], we change context based on selection,
        not on focus.

        Use "NativeFunctionWrapper" instead of "PrototypeFunction" in cross-frame

        regardless of whether the access to the function is cross-frame.
        
        This is faster and more idiomatic than what we had before. It also would
        have avoided Bug 26532 because it would have prevented a conflicting
        PrototypeFunction from being allocated to wrap postMessage, where a
        NativeFunctionWrapper had been allocated previously.

        feTile implementation missing
        [https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26419]

        Implementation of feTile, a pattern effect for SVG filters. It was
        necessary to modify FilterEffect since source inputs need a secial
        logic and we have to identify if an effect is a source input.

        Attempt to minimize diff of following functional change by first landing
        non-functional change to:
        * Make readUintX() public and static (since they will need to be once
          BMPImageReader is included in *ImageDecoder via composition rather
          than inheritance).  Add wrappers in each class so callers can be
          simpler.  In the next patch, these wrappers will be beefed up slightly
          and the callers will get even simpler.
        * Change direct setting of m_failed to use setFailed(), since in the
          next patch much of this code won't even have direct access to m_failed
        * Add a helper function in ICOImageDecoder to determine the image type
          instead of simply doing it inline
        * Rewrap lines that used to be <=80 cols and slipped over it during the

        If loading a font fails because of the sandbox, we ask the browser process to
        try to load it by calling ensureFontLoaded. If it still fails after
        ensureFontLoaded, we hit a ASSERT_NOT_REACHED.

        This case happens once in a while during browser shutdown. The browser will
        queue a message to the renderer to shutdown, and will then stop answering sync
        messages from the renderer. If the renderer is still loading a page during this
        time, it might try to call the browser process to ask to load a font. The
        browser process will ignore the request, and the font will fail to load, even
        after the second try.

        This is unfortunate, but there is no real risk here, since the renderer will be
        going away as soon as it processes another message.
        
        This can't be layout tested as it depends on the sandbox.

        Patch that make WebCore have a RenderTheme per page


        Create a different RenderTheme per page, so that RenderTheme has
        access to page specific theming. This is needed for the Qt port, as Qt
        supports setting the theme (style) per widget.

        This change was suggested and discussed with Dave Hyatt.

        More detailed:

        1) Create a theme per page or one global one, depending on the needs
           of the platform.
        2) Add an accesser to the theme from RenderObject.
        3) Change all uses of the theming to access the theme through
           RenderObject, using the global default theme as fallback, when the
           document of RenderObject has no page.
           When we don't have access to a RenderObject, use the default theme.
        4) Modify all RenderTheme platform implementations to work with the
           above changes, still creating only one global theme.

        JSDOMWindowCustom was using PropertySlot::putValue, however this interface
        appears to be fundaementally incorrect - PropertySlots are only used to get
        values, all puts use PutPropertySlot.  However PutPropertySlot cannot be
        used in the fashion desired here - it only reports the caching type of a
        write that has been performed.

        (This caused a bug where the put should have triggered a transition, and
        failed to do so.)

        Removing the faulty case from the optimization leads to a ~0.5% progression
        on in-browser SunSpider (presumably the very first case was not being hit
        often, and the simplification here is beneficial).
