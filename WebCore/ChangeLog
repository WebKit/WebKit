        triggers lazy decoding), and simplify all the implementations (without
        changing behavior; just make less verbose).  Remove some other

        <rdar://problem/6983207> Non-layer content is not re-rendered when transition
        starts sometimes (with hardware acceleration).
        
        When deciding which RenderLayers should be composited, when a layer goes into
        compositing mode we repaint the old location. However, we did that before
        we'd looked at all the factors that may force a layer to composite, so missed
        some cases. Fix by doing the repaint once we really know whether it's going
        to composite.

        If loading a font fails because of the sandbox, we ask the browser process to
        try to load it by calling ensureFontLoaded. If it still fails after
        ensureFontLoaded, we hit a ASSERT_NOT_REACHED.

        This case happens once in a while during browser shutdown. The browser will
        queue a message to the renderer to shutdown, and will then stop answering sync
        messages from the renderer. If the renderer is still loading a page during this
        time, it might try to call the browser process to ask to load a font. The
        browser process will ignore the request, and the font will fail to load, even
        after the second try.

        This is unfortunate, but there is no real risk here, since the renderer will be
        going away as soon as it processes another message.
        
        This can't be layout tested as it depends on the sandbox.

        Patch that make WebCore have a RenderTheme per page


        Create a different RenderTheme per page, so that RenderTheme has
        access to page specific theming. This is needed for the Qt port, as Qt
        supports setting the theme (style) per widget.

        This change was suggested and discussed with Dave Hyatt.

        More detailed:

        1) Create a theme per page or one global one, depending on the needs
           of the platform.
        2) Add an accesser to the theme from RenderObject.
        3) Change all uses of the theming to access the theme through
           RenderObject, using the global default theme as fallback, when the
           document of RenderObject has no page.
           When we don't have access to a RenderObject, use the default theme.
        4) Modify all RenderTheme platform implementations to work with the
           above changes, still creating only one global theme.

        <rdar://problem/6974175> ASSERT in JITStubs.cpp at appsaccess.apple.com

        JSDOMWindowCustom was using PropertySlot::putValue, however this interface
        appears to be fundaementally incorrect - PropertySlots are only used to get
        values, all puts use PutPropertySlot.  However PutPropertySlot cannot be
        used in the fashion desired here - it only reports the caching type of a
        write that has been performed.

        (This caused a bug where the put should have triggered a transition, and
        failed to do so.)

        Removing the faulty case from the optimization leads to a ~0.5% progression
        on in-browser SunSpider (presumably the very first case was not being hit
        often, and the simplification here is beneficial).

        When revalidating a resource, calling addClient() on one client might cause another to get removed.
        
        - made CachedResource::addClient() non-virtual and added virtual didAddClient()
        - in CachedResource::switchClientsToRevalidatedResource() add all clients to the client set of the revalidated resource first
        - check if the client is still in the set before invoking didAddClient() for it
        
        No test case, I didn't manage to construct one. You need some combination of 304 revalidation, stylesheets that
        reference each other via @imports and reloading.
