        REGRESSION: LayoutTests/editing/selection/caret-rtl-2.html fails
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33503

        The bug was caused by Font::offsetForPosition's not taking into account the containing block's text direction.
        When RTL text appears in a LTR block, the offset at the beginning of RTL text is on the left of RTL text,
        and the offset at the end of RTL text is on the right of RTL text. For example, if we had RTL text CBA,
        then the correspondance between letters and offsets in logical order are: A -> 0, B -> 1, and C -> 2.

        Case 1. CBA appears in a RTL block:
          In this case, clicking on the visual left of CBA puts the caret naturally at Position("CBA", 2).
          Clicking on the visual right of CBA puts the caret at Position("CBA", 0) as expected.
        Case 2. CBA appears in a LTR block:
          Because the containing block flows from left to right, by convention, Position("CBA", 2") corresponds
          to the visual right of CBA, and Position("CBA", 0) corresponds to the visual left of CBA.
          Therefore, clicking on the visual left of CBA should put the caret at Position("CBA", 0),
          and clicking on the visual right should put it at Position("CBA", 2).

        The bug was caused by WebKit's not considering case 2. The same bug also exist for LTR text in a RTL block.
        Fixed the bug by taking care of the case 2 in InlineTextBox::offsetForPosition.

        Layering Violation in ContextMenu - member variable of type HitTestResult
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50586
        
        ContextMenu had a layering violation by having a member variable of type HitTestResult, because
        classes in WebCore/platform can't know about classes in WebCore.
        
        This patch moves the HitTestResult and all functions that use it out of ContextMenu into ContextMenuController.
        All of the functions that dealt with populating the ContextMenu are now in ContextMenuController, and this
        allowed us to delete the ContextMenu file, putting all of the cross-platform code that used to be it
        in ContextMenuController, and the rest of the code is in the platform-specific files.

        No change in behavior, no new tests.

            of the ContextMenu.
        (WebCore::ContextMenuController::createContextMenu): Fix some indination, and store the HitTestResult in a member

            This allowed us to move checkOrEnableIfNeeded from ContextMenu.

        These functions were all moved from ContextMenu, and changed slightly to fit in ContextMenuController.
        All calls to ContextMenu::appendItem were changed to ContextMenuController::appendItem, which takes care
        of validating the menu.

        GraphicsContext: Merge m_common and m_data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49914

        Move data members from GraphicsContextPrivate into GraphicsContext. So GraphicsContextPlatform.h
        and m_common became unnecessary. They are removed.
        Add two methods to GraphicsContext: platformInit() and platformDestroy(), which
        make the constructor of GraphicsContext clearer.
        Besides add a getter to the private GraphicsContext::m_state member, because some inline
        functions in cairo need it.

        No new test is needed, because this is a refactoring.

        RenderIndicator subclasses should not change the render tree during layout.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50026

        The old code created shadow elements during a layout computation,
        that makes the layout state inconsisntent and cause an assertion failure. 
        This change created shadow elements before the layout to avoid  
        state inconsistencies.
        
        Instead of creating shadows on demand, RenderMeter and
        RenderProgress now create all necessary shadows before layouts,

        returning to a POST result within a frame does a GET instead of a POST
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10199
        
        FrameLoader::loadURLIntoChildFrame had a check for whether a frame
        had a HistoryItem, and if so used that item's URL. However, that did
        not handle the case where the HistoryItem had FormData and thus was the
        result of a POST request. FrameLoader::navigateToDifferentDocument (now
        renamed to loadDifferentDocumentItem) does all that, so just switch to
        using it instead.
        
        Besides the bug fix, the only difference in behavior is that we use the
        HistoryItem's URL instead of original URL when restoring it in a child
        frame. This seems desirable too (for consistency with other browsers, and
        so that we can avoid form double-submits for forms that that do
        POST-then-redirect), and is tested by
        fast/history/history-back-initial-vs-final-url.html.

        handles it if it's buffering the media to disk.

        The webkitwebsrc element also gained BYTES duration query

        Executing FormatBlock on multiple paragraphs inside pre does not remove the outer pre
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47300

        The bug was caused by FormatBlockCommand::formatRange's not removing refNode when the refNode
        contains more than one paragraphs even when the refNode is fully selected.

        Fixed the bug by modifying FormatBlockCommand::formatRange to correctly remove the node in
        such a situation.

        Also fixed a bug in ApplyBlockElementCommand::formatSelection that the end of selection
        is not properly updated when the end of selection resides in the node split by
        rangeForParagraphSplittingTextNodesIfNeeded or endOfNextParagrahSplittingTextNodesIfNeeded.

        Fix for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49220 <<rdar://problem/8644849>, REGRESSION: transforms now
        O(n^3) from pathological behavior in lowestPosition, rightmostPosition, leftmostPosition and topmostPosition.

        This patch throws out the lowest/rightmost/leftmost/topmostPosition functions and re-architects layout overflow
        in the engine to cache all the information required to properly handle scrolling.

        In the old code, there were two types of overflow: layout overflow and visual overflow.  The former could
        affect scrolling and the latter could not.  The distinction was largely meaningless, since layout overflow
        wasn't actually used to determine scroll width or scroll height.  It didn't propagate across self-painting layer
        boundaries either.  In the old code, the term visible overflow meant the union of the layout overflow and
        visual overflow rects.

        In the new code, the two types of overflow remain, but the distinction between the two is now clear.  Visual overflow
        is used purely for painting and hit testing checks and layout overflow is used specifically for scrolling.  It has
        been expanded to propagate across self-painting layers, to factor in relative positioning and transforms, and to
        work with writing modes.

        In order to minimize layout test changes, layers no longer incorporate right/bottom overflow into their width/height members.
        Doing so uncovered two bugs where left/top overflow was ignored (proof that even having layer dimensions is harmful).
        A render tree dump hack has been put into the code to keep this overflow dumping for the RenderView's layer, since otherwise
        a huge number of tests would change.

        Added fast/overflow/overflow-rtl-vertical.html to test vertical writing-mode overflow.  Existing tests cover the rest.

        frameRect is a helper for obtaining the x, y, width, height of an InlineBox as an IntRect.

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::placeBoxesInInlineDirection):
        All of the overflow setting in the inline direction has been removed from this function.  All line overflow is computed
        at once now in a single function: computeOverflow.

        New functions that set the overflow computed by computeOverflow.  These replace setBlockDirectionOverflowPositions
        and setInlineDirectionOverflowPositions.  They essentially do the same thing, but they operate on rectangles.

        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::nodeAtPoint):
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::paint):
        Changed to use visual overflow instead of visible overflow.  (Visible overflow as a union of layout and visual
        overflow is no longer necessary, since visual overflow is now equivalent to the old visible overflow concept.)

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.h:
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::logicalLayoutOverflowRect):
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::logicalVisualOverflowRect):
        Helpers for obtaining logical overflow rectangles, since lines compute their overflow in logical terms before
        converting to block coordinates at the end.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::computeOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderBlock::addOverflowFromFloats):
        (WebCore::RenderBlock::addOverflowFromPositionedObjects):
        Blocks now have a computeOverflow function called at the end of layout that adds in all the types of overflow.  The addOverflowFromChildren
        method is virtual so that RenderListItem and RenderTable can subclass it.  RenderListItem has to position its list marker and
        propagate marker overflow up, and RenderTable adds in overflow from its sections.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::layoutOnlyPositionedObjects):
        (WebCore::RenderBlock::layoutPositionedObjects):
        When only positioned objects lay out, overflow must still be recomputed.  The refactoring of overflow computation into a single
        callable method: computeOverflow, makes it possible for this to be done easily.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::paint):
        visible -> visual.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::addOverhangingFloats):
        The propagation of float overflow has changed substantially.  The basic rules are:
            (1) The float must be in our floating objects list to contribute to overflow.
            (2) The float must be a descendant to contribute to overflow.
            (3) The block must have the outermost list that contains the float, or it has a self-painting layer and
                so the float needs to be included in its overflow.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::nodeAtPoint):
        visible -> visual.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::layoutColumns):
        Remove column overflow computation from layoutColumns and move it to computeOverflow.

        (WebCore::RenderBlock::adjustLinePositionForPagination):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderBlock.h:

        for transforms, relative positioning and writing mode differences.

        (WebCore::RenderBox::topLayoutOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderBox::bottomLayoutOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderBox::leftLayoutOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderBox::rightLayoutOverflow):
        Changed the default rectangle for layout overflow to be the client box to match the scrollable areas of overflow regions.

        (WebCore::RenderBox::clientLogicalBottom):
        New helper for obtaining the logical bottom of the client box.

        (WebCore::RenderBox::clientBoxRect):
        New helper for obtaining the clientLeft/Top/Width/Height box.

        * rendering/RenderBoxModelObject.h:
        (WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::relativePositionLogicalOffset):
        Helper for obtaining the relative position offset transposed for vertical writing modes.  Used by line overflow.

        * rendering/RenderFlexibleBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderFlexibleBox::layoutBlock):
        Changed flexible boxes to just call the base class computeOverflow method.

        * rendering/RenderInline.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderInline::linesVisualOverflowBoundingBox):
        (WebCore::RenderInline::clippedOverflowRectForRepaint):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderInline.h:
        * rendering/RenderLayer.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::updateLayerPosition):
        Changed layers to no longer incorporate right/bottom overflow into width/height.  This is the reason many layout
        tests change.  (Not doing this makes the layout test changes far worse, since overflow propagates across self-painting
        layers now.)

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowTop):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowBottom):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowLeft):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::overflowRight):
        overflowTop/Bottom/Left/Right return overflow that accounts for writing modes, i.e., purely physical overflow that can be used
        to set up the scroll area.

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::computeScrollDimensions):
        Drastically simplified this method now that overflowTop/Bottom/Left/Right just do the right thing regarding unreachable overflow.

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::updateScrollInfoAfterLayout):
        Make sure to explicitly set the vertical scrollbar's position just as we did with horizontal scrollbars, so that clamping to the
        bottom works.

        (WebCore::performOverlapTests):
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::paintLayer):
        Fix a bug in performOverlapTests.  It incorrectly used the layer's bounds, and so it didn't account for left/top overflow out
        of the layer (see why I hate layers even having dimensions?).  Changed it to use the bounding box of the layer instead.

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::hitTest):
        Fix a bug in hit testing.  It incorrectly used the root layer's bounds as the limit of the hit test, and so it didn't account
        for left/top overflow in a ScrollView (hate hate hate layers having dimensions).  I changed it to use the hit test rect instead,
        so that the damage rect never stops the point from being tested (unless the hit test request says not to ignore clipping).

        (WebCore::RenderLayer::localBoundingBox):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderLayer.h:
        Added the new overflowTop/Left/Right/Bottom accessors.

        * rendering/RenderLineBoxList.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderLineBoxList::anyLineIntersectsRect):
        (WebCore::RenderLineBoxList::lineIntersectsDirtyRect):
        (WebCore::RenderLineBoxList::paint):
        (WebCore::RenderLineBoxList::hitTest):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderListItem.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderListItem::addOverflowFromChildren):
        (WebCore::RenderListItem::positionListMarker):
        * rendering/RenderListItem.h:
        RenderListItem now positions the list marker when computing its overflow, since the marker propagates overflow back up to the list item.

        * rendering/RenderListMarker.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderListMarker::paint):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderMarquee.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderMarquee::computePosition):
        Changed to use overflow functions instead of rightmost/lowestPosition.

        * rendering/RenderMedia.cpp:
        * rendering/RenderMedia.h:
        Removed the lowest/topmost/rightmost/leftmostPosition functions, since control overflow is handled properly already.

        * rendering/RenderOverflow.h:
        (WebCore::RenderOverflow::RenderOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderOverflow::setLayoutOverflow):
        (WebCore::RenderOverflow::setVisualOverflow):
        Add new setters for layout and visual overflow as rects.

        * rendering/RenderReplaced.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderReplaced::shouldPaint):
        (WebCore::RenderReplaced::clippedOverflowRectForRepaint):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderRubyRun.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderRubyRun::layout):
        Call computeOverflow to recompute our overflow information after we adjust the ruby.

        * rendering/RenderTable.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTable::layout):
        (WebCore::RenderTable::addOverflowFromChildren):
        (WebCore::RenderTable::paint):
        * rendering/RenderTable.h:
        Move section overflow propagation into addOverflowFromChildren, and change RenderTable to just call computeOverflow.

        * rendering/RenderTableCell.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTableCell::clippedOverflowRectForRepaint):
        visible -> visual.

        (WebCore::RenderTableCell::scrollbarsChanged):
        Adding unreachable overflow support (something that in the old code only existed for positioned objects in the root view) exposed
        a bug in table layout.  If scrollbars are added during the layout that occurs after intrinsic padding was incorporated into the
        cell, then the cell won't lay out properly the second time (after the scrollbars have been added).  We have to adjust the intrinsic
        padding accounting for the presence of the new scrollbar so the second layout will get the right dimensions.

        * rendering/RenderTableCell.h:
        (WebCore::RenderTableCell::hasVisualOverflow):
        visible -> visual.

        * rendering/RenderTableSection.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderTableSection::layoutRows):
        * rendering/RenderTableSection.h:
        visible -> visual.  Removed the leftmost/rightmost/topmost/bottommostPosition functions.

        * rendering/RenderTreeAsText.cpp:
        (WebCore::writeLayers):
        Added a hack to render tree dumping to include right/bottom overflow for the root layer only.  This keeps a zillion layout tests
        from failing.

        * rendering/RenderView.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderView::layout):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docTop):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docBottom):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docLeft):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docRight):
        * rendering/RenderView.h:
        (WebCore::RenderView::docHeight):
        (WebCore::RenderView::docWidth):
        RenderView now uses docLeft/Top/Height/Width functions, which are just overflow queries that account for writing modes.  These methods
        are now the preferred way to query for the physical dimensions of a document.

        * rendering/RootInlineBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::RootInlineBox::addHighlightOverflow):
        Changed to call setOverflowFromLogicalRects instead of the block/inline position functions.

        (WebCore::RootInlineBox::alignBoxesInBlockDirection):
        Remove the computation of block direction overflow, since it now all happens at once after the line is built.

        (WebCore::RootInlineBox::paddedLayoutOverflowRect):
        * rendering/RootInlineBox.h:
        Added a new helper function for incorporating the end padding into a line.  This end padding also includes the single pixel for a caret
        in LTR if needed.
