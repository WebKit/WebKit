This test checks that any element focused via an autofocus attribute will have :focus-visible matching enabled.
If the button that says "I will be focused automatically" has a red background, then the test result is FAILURE. If it has a green outline, then the test result is SUCCESS.

I will be focused automatically.

FAIL Autofocus should match :focus-visible assert_equals: expected "rgb(0, 100, 0)" but got "rgb(0, 0, 0)"
