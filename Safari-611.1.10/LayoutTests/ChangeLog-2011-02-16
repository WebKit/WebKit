        We have a number of functions from different domains in single instance of InspectorBackend.
        It'd be better to split the functions by their domains.
        As example 'evaluate' will be moved from InspectorBackend to RuntimeAgent container.

        Rebaseline chromium-linux tests with menulists (select drop downs).
        We now match Windows w.r.t. sizes, the only difference is the
        background color of the menulist (in themeChromiumLinux.css).

        Unreviewed; new Chromium/Linux test baselines.

        Finish up implementing the new event model in IndexedDB
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54331

        Make the requried changes + s/result/request/g (where it should
        have always been that way) + remove the verify functions (since
        these days they mostly just add noise) + get rid of the callback
        in the delete object store funciton.

        Added new text expectations for GTK port. They should be actually
        valid for any port using the libsoup backend. We need different
        results because as stated here
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3812#c6, the original test
        results were designed for NSURLConnection which adds the
        "Content-Length: 0" header for null message bodies. That does not
        happen in libsoup, so instead of artificially add that header we
        better generate different results.

        Also take into account that for HEAD and GET requests the body is
        not included so we should expect always a null for them.

        The only functional change is that preventDefault now must
        be called in error events to prevent the transaction from
        being aborted. The tests reflect this change and there's one
        specific test to look at this behavior.

        Skip an SVG test that fails depending on what other tests came before it

        Running any other SVG test before this one causes it to fail. If we were to check in new
        failing results, it might start passing again if some more tests are added before it that
        make it the first test that is run for a particular invocation of DumpRenderTree. So the
        safest thing to do for now is to skip it. <http://webkit.org/b/35700> tracks this failure.

        Update Windows results after r77485

        Windows used to match Mac on these tests, but now it doesn't. Presumably this is because
        r77485 increased the precision of ascent/descent calculations, making differences in
        Windows/Mac font metrics matter more.

        One test (svg/W3C-SVG-1.1-SE/types-dom-01-b.svg) is still failing, but it passes when run on
        its own, so warrants more investigation.

        small text which is scaled to be large renders pixelated
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12448

        Update SVG test results after fixing small font size support. Land new mac/mac-leopard baseline, as text looks slightly different
        in each testcase, as the font-size used for on-screen rendering has changed, this results in hinting differences, inter-glyph
        space changes, etc. This commit only includes the textual result changes, the pixel test baseline will land in chunks in follow-up commits.

        To those who have to rebaseline their platforms: Some of the svg/text pixel test results may look questionable on first sight,
        - svg/text/select-* tests:
          These tests render a certain string 'Foobar' and query the metrics using SVG Text DOM API (getExtentOfChar(firstChar) and getExtentOfChar(lastChar)).
          A red rectangle is drawn, to represent the size of the string, which gives precise results using floating-point accurancy.
          Using eventSender, a selection is simulated, by clicking the first char, holding down, and moving towards the last character.
          The blue selection rect which is drawn, should in theory be equal to the red rectangle.
          In practice it is not, as the selection rect is aligned to integer boundaries (see floor calls in Font::selectionRect...).
          Since we switched to use floating-point precision metrics, the actual drawn selection may exceed the red rectangle up to 1px.

        - svg/text/selection-(doubleclick|tripleclick).svg:
          These tests use DRTs dumpSelectionRect() which draws a red rectangle, highlighting the SelectionController::bounds() obtained through RenderView.
          In theory this red rectangle, should be equal to the drawn blue selection rect. Again it isn't, as the bounds() methods uses selectionRectForRepaint()
          of RenderText, which returns an enclosingIntRect of the actual selection. The drawn selection starts at y=0.93 in the first testcase, the selectionRectForRepaint()
          call returns an IntRect, which starts at y=0. That explains why the red rectangle starts slightly higher as it should be. Again this is no problem, the repaint
          rect may be 1px larger, if it would be smaller, we had a problem. The only way to fix this, would be to pass around FloatRect as repaint rects, but that's not worth it.

        - css3/zoom-coords.* / svg/zoom/page/zoom-zoom-coords*:
          These tests have different expectations now, as we're using the floatAscent/floatDesent/floatHeight FontMetrics methods instead of
          the integer variants ascent/descent/height - hopefully we'll see consistent results across platforms for these tests now, if not please comment in the bug report.

        new-run-webkit-tests: hardcode the directories to scan for tests

        use by default instead of skipping over directories in the
        expectations file. We do this so that we will be able to merge
        the expectations files without getting conflicting SKIP
        directives. Note that this change will reduce the # of tests
        being run on the Mac GPU bots, because we're accidentally

        Fix a text rendering problem when enclosing block is RTL and text runs
        are in different directionality.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34176

        The problem happens in the following example scenario (ABC represents 
        Hebrew characters):
        <div dir=rtl>this is a <span><span>test <span>ABC</span></span></span></div>

        The line consists of 3 text runs -- TextRun1 TextRun2 TextRun3. In which
        TextRun1 and TextRun2's bidi level are 2, and TextRun3's bidi level is 1.
        TextRun2 and TextRun3's least common ancestor is not a sibling of TextRun1.

        The visual bidi run order of the text runs is TextRun3 TextRun1 TextRun2.

        Inside RenderBlock::constructLine(), when RenderBlock::createLineBoxes()
        creates InlineFlowBox for TextRun2, it should check an InlineFlowBox for
        the run's render object's ancestor (not only its parent) has already 
        been constructed or has something following it on the line, in which 
        case, create a new box for TextRun2 instead of sharing the same box with
        TextRun3.

        In other words, the following 2 div should render the same results
        (ABC represents Hebrew characters).
        <div dir=rtl>this is a <span><span>test <span>ABC</span></span></span></div>
        <div dir=rtl>this is a <span>Test <span>ABC</span></span></div>

        All show 1px diffs, but are progressions, since the lineSpacing calculation has been improved.

        with a non-layered parent. It is a pixel test and is just looking for a correct
        image. The second test is similar but has a 4 deep hierarchy of <div> element where 
        only the innermost layer has a 3D transform. It is also a pixel test.
        The other 2 tests are the same except that they add and then remove the innermost
        layer's transform. It makes sure the layer tree is correct before and after

        Make compositing/tiling/huge-layer-resize.html faster, more reliable,
        and more crashy (when there's a WebKit bug)

        This test was trying to cause a layout/paint to happen by returning to
        the event loop for a certain amount of time via setTimeout. But this
        didn't always result in a layout/paint (at least on Windows). We now
        force the layout/paint explicitly, which also lets us speed up the test
        by removing the setTimeouts.

        Unreviewed Chromium test expectations update.

        Rebaseline six tests in fast/repaint for chromium-mac. Even after the 
        scrollbar switch they need Chromium-specific results since repaint
        regions are different from the mac port's.

        Adds both Leopard (chromium-mac-leopard) and Snow Leopard (chromium-mac)
        baselines.

        [Qt] Spatial Navigation: adding a test for when scrollbars are turned off via WebKit API
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51396

        Add a layout test to ensure that page is scrollable when spatial
        navgation is enabled even when scrollbars were disabled via WebKit
        API (e.g. QWebFrame::setScrollBarPolicy).

        Test is Qt-only for now since Qt's DRT is the only one that supports
        LayoutTestController::setScrollbarPolicy.

        In real world QtWebKit apps, scrollbars are disabled usually prior to
        any page load. To emulate that on a layout test, it was added two html
        files: one that set scrollbars off and queues the load of the real
        test, and other that does the real testing.

        onbeforeunload is broken for framesets
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19418

        Added tests to ensure WebKit fires beforeunload events for subframes,
        and disallows navigation except that of javascript scheme while beforeunload event
        handlers are being called.

        Also added a test to ensure WebKit fires beforeunload event for subframes exactly
        once even if a subframe was moved around within a beforeunload event handler.

        A test that ensures beforeunload event is not fired for an iframe if the iframe
        was added or removed within a beforeunload event handler is also added.

        Furthermore, a test to ensure WebKit does not fire a beforeunload event to an iframe
        that has been adopted by a document outside of the unloading document is added.

        prototype-inheritance prints FAIL when it shouldn't
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52007

        Before this patch, we were testing the prototypes of primitive values,
        but the rules for primitive values are different than the rules for
        objects.  Primitive values get their prototypes from the current
        lexical scope when they get boxed.  This test is designed to test that
        objects get their prototypes from their original holder.

        In this patch, we skip testing non-object/non-functions.  We can add
        another test for primitives if we think that would be valuable.

        Shadows are not drawn when filling a rect with a gradient fillStyle on Mac and Chromium-Mac
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51869

        GraphicsContext::fillRect(const FloatRect&) is clipping to the rect.
        The shadow is being drawn, but getting clipped to the rect being filled.
        The solution is to draw the gradient into a CGLayer (when a shadow is
        required), then render the layer to the GraphicsContext.

        This patch also fixes:
        canvas/philip/tests/2d.shadow.gradient.alpha.html

        Update expectations after r74892. A bunch of previously failing tests
        now pass (since they match scrollbars with the mac port). Some tests
        also started to fail, they should be fixed by removing their
        chromium-mac baselines.

        sandbox iframes have access to top.history methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38152

        Test that sandboxed iframes cannot use history to navigate the top
        frame.  This test is less than ideal, as described in the test itself.
        If I was really on top of things, I'd add a test for successful use of
        the history API when allow-top-navigation is set, but that test would
        be complicated and I'm lazy (enough to copy directly from abarth).

        Selection becomes stale when CharacterData is manipulated directly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51389

        Added tests to ensure WebKit adjusts or clears selection when the start container
        or the end container of the selection's first range is modified by CharacterData's API.

        Many editing tests had to be rebaselined due to different editing delegate dumps
        caused by WebKit's properly adjusting selection's offsets as editing commands modify the DOM.

        the width of the control drops below 240px.

        This change results in a minor pixel difference - the timebar now
        aligns better with the time and when the time is not displayed is
        now perfectly centered. Disabling the affected tests for now
        and will rebaseline.

        vertical distance respectively. Their values are in coordinate space
        units. They are not affected by the current transformation matrix."

        NOTE: this applies only to canvas, not to box shadows.

        editing/execCommand/toggle-compound-styles.html needs new expected results after r74269.

        Default editing behavior of GTK+ DRT was changed from Mac to Unix, and this test is wrongly

        It's arguably a bug, but we don't let inline flow layers paint floating
        descendants.  The containing block of the inline flow paints them instead.
        However our shouldPaint logic has always been flawed and has turned off propagation
        of painting when an inline flow layer is enclosing the float.
        
        Change enclosingSelfPaintingLayer to enclosingFloatPaintingLayer to be more precise
        and for now limit it to RenderBoxes.

        [Qt] Canvas shadow offset should not be affected by any transformation
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50422

        On a canvas context, shadows are currently affected by all
        transformations except scaling. According to the spec:
        http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#shadows

        "The shadowOffsetX and shadowOffsetY attributes specify the distance
        that the shadow will be offset in the positive horizontal and positive
        vertical distance respectively. Their values are in coordinate space
        units. They are not affected by the current transformation matrix."

        NOTE: this applies only to canvas, not to box shadows.

        Add new test to ensure that shadows are correctly transformed keeping
        the relative offset to the shape.

        Now that we've switched Chromium to the DRT (and the switch seems to

        with the DRT (but not test_shell).

        [Qt] StillImage::draw() should use ContextShadow
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50849

        The branch that checks for a shadow requirement in StillImage::draw()
        is executed when drawing a canvas onto a canvas with
        ctx1.drawImage(canvas2, x, y). The current implementation supports
        solid shadows only. And if transformations are present, the offset gets
        transformed as well. Thus, ContextShadow must be used instead in order
        to support blur and correct offset transformations.

        Unreviewed Chromium test expectations update.
        
        Delete a bunch of chromium-win specific baselines that were added by
        r68608. That was done because r68568 checked in failing expectations,
        but since Chromium was passing the tests with Skia, we wanted to keep
        passing them. However, the failing expectations were rolled out by
        r68737, so we no longer needed Chromium-specific expectations.
        
        Later, with r71481 we updated to a new version of the Philip test suite,
        which has a different output format, and the Chromium-specific
        expectations were out of date. Since they're not needed (we should pass
        with the base ones), they can just be deleted.

        [Qt] Search input field doesn't have cancel button
        Add a cancel button to the search field and make it customizable
        by the client. For now, use the close dialog button associated
        with the application's style as the default.

        Unskip a bunch of search field related tests that pass now:

        We recently tightened up our spec conformance in generating syntax
        error in these cases, however testing in the wild has shown this
        to be problematic. This reverts the previous change in allowing
        class escapes (e.g. \d) in ranges in character classes ([]), but
        does retain some closer conformance to the spec in only allowing
        ranges that would be permitted per the grammar rules in the spec
        (e.g. in /[\d-a-z]/ "a-z" cannot be considered as a range).

        RTL static position computation did not subtract out the width of the enclosing box if the

        to be RTL when the document was RTL.

        Fix for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49220 <<rdar://problem/8644849>, REGRESSION: transforms now
        O(n^3) from pathological behavior in lowestPosition, rightmostPosition, leftmostPosition and topmostPosition.

        This patch throws out the lowest/rightmost/leftmost/topmostPosition functions and re-architects layout overflow
        in the engine to cache all the information required to properly handle scrolling.

        In the old code, there were two types of overflow: layout overflow and visual overflow.  The former could
        affect scrolling and the latter could not.  The distinction was largely meaningless, since layout overflow
        wasn't actually used to determine scroll width or scroll height.  It didn't propagate across self-painting layer
        boundaries either.  In the old code, the term visible overflow meant the union of the layout overflow and
        visual overflow rects.

        In the new code, the two types of overflow remain, but the distinction between the two is now clear.  Visual overflow
        is used purely for painting and hit testing checks and layout overflow is used specifically for scrolling.  It has
        been expanded to propagate across self-painting layers, to factor in relative positioning and transforms, and to
        work with writing modes.

        In order to minimize layout test changes, layers no longer incorporate right/bottom overflow into their width/height members.
        Doing so uncovered two bugs where left/top overflow was ignored (proof that even having layer dimensions is harmful).
        A render tree dump hack has been put into the code to keep this overflow dumping for the RenderView's layer, since otherwise
        a huge number of tests would change.

        Added fast/overflow/overflow-rtl-vertical.html to test vertical writing-mode overflow.  Existing tests cover the rest.

        Unreviewed move of Chromium baselines.
        
        In preparation for making pixel tests pass for Chromium on Snow Leopard,
        move baselines for 273 tests from chromium-mac to chromium-mac-leopard.
        These tests will then use the mac baselines, which will enable them
        to pass on Snow Leopard, but keep passing for Leopard too.

        List of files omitted due to length but composed entirely of moves from
        platform/chromium-mac to platform/chromium-mac-leopard.
