Description:
This directory contains the source code of Abseil for C++. This can be used by
Chromium, subject to the guidance at https://chromium-cpp.appspot.com/; it can
be used without restriction by Chromium's dependencies, except that objects
compiled into Chromium itself cannot use anything relying on
absl::base_internal::FastTypeId (see https://crbug.com/1096380).

How to update Abseil:

1. Download the code from the Abseil git repository (see URL).

2. Copy the content of the Abseil git repo to //third_party/abseil-cpp.

3. From your source root run third_party/abseil-cpp/generate_def_files.py to
   regenerate Windows symbol definition files.

Local Modifications:

* absl/copts.bzl has been translated to //third_party/absl-cpp/BUILD.gn. Both
  files contain lists of compiler flags in order to reduce duplication.

* All the BUILD.bazel files have been translated to BUILD.gn files.

* Patches from //third_party/abseil-cpp/patches have been applied.
