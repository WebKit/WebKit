    <h1>In Depth Analysis</h1>

    <p>
    JetStream combines a variety of JavaScript benchmarks, covering a variety of
    advanced workloads and programming techniques, and reports a single score that
    balances them using geometric mean.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each benchmark measures a distinct workload, and no single optimization
    technique is sufficient to speed up all benchmarks. Latency tests measure that a
    web application can start up quickly, ramp up to peak performance quickly, and
    run smoothly without interruptions. Throughput tests measure the sustained peak
    performance of a web application, ignoring ramp-up time and spikes in
    smoothness. Some benchmarks demonstrate tradeoffs, and aggressive or specialized
    optimization for one benchmark might make another benchmark slower.
    </p>

    <p>
    JetStream includes benchmarks from the SunSpider 1.0.2 and Octane 2 JavaScript
    benchmark suites. It also includes benchmarks from the LLVM compiler open source
    project, compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten 1.13. It also includes a
    benchmark based on the Apache Harmony open source project's HashMap and a port of
    the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/sss/projects/cdx/">CDx</a> benchmark,
    hand-translated to JavaScript.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    These benchmarks cover both classical performance measurements &mdash; like Martin
    Richards's machine and language independent benchmark (richards) and the
    Dhrystone synthetic computing benchmark (dry.c) &mdash; and real-world examples &mdash; like
    the Mozilla open source project's PDF renderer (pdfjs), the Box2D JavaScript
    physics engine (box2d), and the jQuery and Closure JavaScript libraries (code-
    first-load, code-multi-load).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Note that scores from JetStream 1.1 are not comparable to scores from other versions
    of JetStream.
