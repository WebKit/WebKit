    This tests that unknown file types are handled correctly when dropped in the window
    <ul> 
        <li>
            Drag a file that WebKit doesn't recognise -- eg. a disk image, tarball, etc.<br />
            WebKit should cause a Finder window to open, with the dropped file selected.  
        </li>
        <li> 
            Attempt to drop a directory onto the WebView.<br />
            The drag should not be accepted, and the drag cursor should be the standard disallowed drag cursor.
