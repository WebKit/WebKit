To run this test, both timeout-test.html and timeout-test.php must be served over http.<br>
And you must be patient.<br>
Clicking on this button will post a form that takes over 10 minutes for the server to respond.  The connection should not time out!<br>
<form action="timeout-test.php" method="post">
<input type="submit" value="Run Test">
