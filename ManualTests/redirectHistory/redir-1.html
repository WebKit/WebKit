<p>This test checks that a &quot;quick&quot; redirect does not create an extra entry in the back/forward list.  See Radar 4351664.</p>
<p>Wait a few seconds for the redirect to occur.  If you return to this page after the redirect, then the test passed.  If you end up at redir-2.html, then the test failed.</p>
