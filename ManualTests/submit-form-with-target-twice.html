<form id="f" target="foo"><input></form>
<p>This tests that calling form.submit() twice in a row from JavaScript, on a form with a custom target and with at least one text field does not cause an assertion in a debug build of Safari.
</p>
<p>To test this, click the button below. A new window should open up and Safari should not assert.</p>
<button onclick="runTest()">Click Here</button>
