<p>Simple manual behavior test for the interaction between selection drags,
context menu invocation, and actual dragging. In order to test, simply start
selecting a span of text by clicking and dragging. During text selection, no
drag should start. While selecting text, press and hold the right mouse button
to invoke the context menu, then release the right mouse button over a context
menu entry like "Copy". After this, if you keep moving the mouse around, no drag
of the selected text should start, even though the left mouse button is still
held down.
