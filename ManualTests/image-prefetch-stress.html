When an image is preloaded in javascript, the size of the image is never
reported to the javascript garbage collector.  If a large image is repeatedly
preloaded but never used, it will not free any of the images until the
garbage collector has run out of space to allocate any new free javascript
variables.  This test passes if after a certain point, the number of allocated
images as reported by the caches window stops growing.
