<p>This page test that using the Web Inspector's search field on a page that
overrides <tt>Document.evaluate</tt> or <tt>Document.querySelectorAll</tt>
still works.<p>

<p>To test, right-click on this page and select &ldquo;Inspect Element&rdquo;,
then type &ldquo;p&rdquo; in the search field (without the quotes). If the
search results list appears, then you have passed the test. If one or more
alert dialogs appear, you have failed the test.</p>

<script>
    function fail() { alert('FAIL') }
    document.querySelectorAll = fail;
    document.evaluate = fail;
</script>
