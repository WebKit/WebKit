<title>Undo Autocorrection Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This test verifies that common contraction is not marked as misspelled when autocorrection is off.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Bring up contextual manual, and uncheck "Spelling and Grammar -> Correct Spelling Automatically" and "Substitutions -> Text Replacement".</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Type "this wasn't", and verify that "wasn't" isn't marked as mispelled.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Restore the settings in contextual manual, otherwise it may affect the result of other autocorrection related tests.</p>
