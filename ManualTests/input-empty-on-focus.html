<div><img width="200" height="200" src="resources/200x200.png"></div>
<div><input onfocus="this.value = ''" value="drop image here go boom"></div>
<p>Drag the image above down into the text field.
If the test succeeds there will be no crash and you'll end up with an empty text field with a blinking caret.
It's arguably a bug that the text field accepts an image at all, so some day we might fix that and make this
test obsolete. Maybe we can find some other way to test the same code path.</p>
