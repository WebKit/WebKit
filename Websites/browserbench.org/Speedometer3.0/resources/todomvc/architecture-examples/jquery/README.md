# Speedometer 3.0: TodoMVC: jQuery

## Description

This application uses jQuery to implement a todo application.

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

## Implementation details

[TBD]

## Built steps

A simple build script copies all necessary files to a `dist` folder.
It does not rely on compilers or transpilers and serves raw html, css and js files to the user.

```
npm run build
```
