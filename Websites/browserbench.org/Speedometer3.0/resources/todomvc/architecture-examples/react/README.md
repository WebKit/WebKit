# Speedometer 3.0: TodoMVC: React

## Description

This application uses React 17.0.2 to implement a todo application.

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

## Implementation details

React:\
Model: todoReducer (reducer.js)\
View: React ui components\
controller: App component + useReducer hook

MVC:\
Model: maintains the data and behavior of an application\
View: displays the model in the ui\
Controller: serves as an interface between view & model components

## Built steps

To build the static files, this application utilizes webpack. It minifies and optimizes output files and copies all necessary files to a `dist` folder.

```
* Node (min version: 18.13.0)
