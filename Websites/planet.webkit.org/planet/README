Planet
------

Planet is a flexible feed aggregator. It downloads news feeds published by
web sites and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed,
latest news first.

It uses Mark Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser to read from RDF, RSS and Atom
feeds; and Tomas Styblo's templating engine to output static files in any
format you can dream up.

Keywords: feed, blog, aggregator, RSS, RDF, Atom, OPML, Python
