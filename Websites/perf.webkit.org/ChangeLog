        (App.Dashboard): Inherit from App.NameLabelModel now that each predefined dashboard has a name.
        (App.MetricSerializer.normalizePayload): Parse all predefined dashboards instead of a single dashboard.
        IDs are generated for each dashboard for forward compatibility.

        New perf dashboard erroneously clears zoom when poping history items
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141278

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The bug was caused by _sharedZoomChanged updating overviewSelection without updating mainPlotDomain.

        Updating overviewSelection resulted in _overviewSelectionChanged, which observes changes to overviewSelection,
        to schedule a call to propagateZoom, which in turn overrode "sharedZoom" we just parsed from the query string.

        * public/v2/app.js:
        (App.PaneController._overviewSelectionChanged): Don't schedule propagateZoom if the selected domain is already
        shown in the main plot.

        This patch adds the support for triggering A/B testing from the perf dashboard.

        We add a few new tables to the database. "build_triggerables", which represents a set of builders
        that accept A/B testing. "triggerable_repositories" associates each "triggerable" with a fixed set
        of repositories for which an arbitrary revision can be specified for A/B testing.
        "triggerable_configurations" specifies a triggerable available on a given test on a given platform.
        "roots" table which specifies the revision used in a given root set in each repository.

        * init-database.sql: Added "build_triggerables", "triggerable_repositories",
        "triggerable_configurations", and "roots" tables. Added references to "build_triggerables",
        "platforms", and "tests" tables as well as columns to store status, status url, and creation time
        to build_requests table. Also made each test group's name unique in a given analysis task as it
        would be confusing to have multiple test groups of the same name.

        * public/admin/tests.php: Added the UI and the code to associate a test with a triggerable.

        the status of those builds to the perf dashboard. A similar script can be written to support
        other continuous builds systems.
        (main): Fetches the list of pending builds as well as currently running or completed builds from
        a buildbot, and report new statuses of builds requests to the perf dashboard. It will then schedule
        a single new build on each builder with no pending builds, and marks the set of open build requests
        that have been scheduled to run on the buildbot but not found in the first step as stale.
        (load_config): Loads a JSON that contains the configurations for each builder. e.g.
        [
            {
                "platform": "mac-mavericks",

                }
            }
        ]

        (find_request_updates): Return a list of build request status updates to make based on the pending
        builds as well as in-progress and completed builds on each builder on the buildbot. When a build is
        completed, we use the special status "failedIfNotCompleted" which results in "failed" status only
        if the build request had not been completed. This is necessary because a failed build will not
        report its failed-ness back to the perf dashboard in some cases; e.g. lost slave or svn up failure.
        (update_and_fetch_build_requests): Submit the build request status updates and retrieve the list
        of open requests the perf dashboard has.
        (find_stale_request_updates): Compute the list of build requests that have been scheduled on the
        buildbot but not found in find_request_updates. These build requests are lost. e.g. a master reboot
        or human canceling a build may trigger such a state.
        (schedule_request): Schedules a build with the arguments specified in the configuration JSON after
        replacing repository names with their revisions and buildRequest with the build request id.
        (config_for_request): Finds a builder for the test and the platform of a build request.
        (fetch_json): Fetches a JSON from the specified URL, optionally with BasicAuth.
        (property_value_from_build): Returns the value of a specific property in a buildbot build.
        (request_id_from_build): Returns the build request id of a given buildbot build if there is one.

        New perf dashboard should not duplicate author information in each commit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139756

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Instead of each commit having author name and email, make it reference a newly added committers table.
        Also replace "email" by "account" since some repositories don't use emails as account names.

        This improves the keyword search performance in commits.php since LIKE now runs on committers table,
        which only contains as many rows as there are accounts in each repository, instead of commits table
        which contains every commit ever happened in each repository.

        To migrate an existing database into match the new schema, run:

        BEGIN;

        INSERT INTO committers (committer_repository, committer_name, committer_email)
            (SELECT DISTINCT commit_repository, commit_author_name, commit_author_email

        New perf dashboard's chart UI is buggy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139214

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The bugginess was caused by weird interactions between charts and panes. Rewrote the code to fix it.

        Superfluous selectionChanged and domainChanged "event" actions were removed from the interactive chart
        component. This is not how Ember.js components should interact to begin with. The component now exposes
        selectedPoints and always updates selection instead of sharedSelection.

        * public/v2/app.js:
        (App.ChartsController.present): Added. We can't call Date.now() in various points in our code as that
        would lead to infinite mutual recursions since X-axis domain values wouldn't match up.
        (App.ChartsController.updateSharedDomain): This function was completely useless. The overview's start
        and end time should be completely determined by "since" and the present time.
        (App.ChartsController._startTimeChanged): Ditto.
        (App.ChartsController._scheduleQueryStringUpdate):
        (App.ChartsController._updateQueryString): Set "zoom" only if it's different from the shared domain.

        (App.domainsAreEqual): Moved from InteractiveChartComponent._xDomainsAreSame.

        (App.PaneController.actions.createAnalysisTask): Use selectedPoints property set by the chart.
        (App.PaneController.actions.overviewDomainChanged): Removed; only needed to call updateSharedDomain.
        (App.PaneController.actions.rangeChanged): Removed. _showDetails (renamed to _updateDetails) directly
        observes the changes to selectedPoints property as it gets updated by the main chart.
        (App.PaneController._overviewSelectionChanged): This was previously a dead code. Now it's used again
        with a bug fix. When the overview selection is cleared, we use the same domain in the main chart and
        the overview chart.
        (App.PaneController._sharedDomainChanged): Fixed a but that it erroneously updates the overview domain
        when domain arrays aren't identical. This was causing a subtle race with other logic.
        (App.PaneController._sharedZoomChanged): Ditto. Also don't set mainPlotDomain here as any changes to
        overviewSelection will automatically propagate to the main plot's domain as they're aliased.
        (App.PaneController._currentItemChanged): Merged into _updateDetails (renamed from _showDetails).
        (App.PaneController._updateDetails): Previously, this function took points and inspected _hasRange to
        see if those two points correspond to a range or a single data point. Rewrote all that logic by
        directly observing selectedPoints and currentItem properties instead of taking points and relying on
        an instance variable, which was a terrible API.
        (App.PaneController._updateCanAnalyze): Use selectedPoints property. Since this property is only set
        when the main plot has a selected range, we don't have to check this._hasRange anymore.

        (App.InteractiveChartComponent._updateDomain): No longer sends domainChanged "event" action.
        (App.InteractiveChartComponent._sharedSelectionChanged): Removed. This is a dead code.

        Added a new page to see the list of active analysis tasks and a page to view the contents of an analysis task.

        * init-database.sql: Added a bunch of tables to store information about analysis tasks.
            analysis_tasks - Represents each analysis task. Associated with a platform and a metric and possibly with two
            test runs. Analysis tasks not associated with test runs are used for try new patches.

        Perf dashboard should provide a way to associate bugs with a test run
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137857

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Added a "privileged" API, /privileged-api/associate-bug, to associate a bug with a test run.
        /privileged-api/ is to be protected by an authentication mechanism such as DigestAuth over https by
        the Apache configuration.


        The Cross Site Request (CSRF) Forgery prevention for privileged APIs work as follows. When a user is
        about to make a privileged API access, the front end code obtains a CSRF token generated by POST'ing
        to privileged-api/generate-csrf-token; the page sets a randomly generated salt and an expiration time
        via the cookie and returns a token computed from those two values as well as the remote username.

        The font end code then POST's the request along with the returned token. The server side code verifies
        that the specified token can be generated from the salt and the expiration time set in the cookie, and
        the token hasn't expired.


        * init-database.sql: Added bug_url to bug_trackers table, and added bugs table. Each bug tracker will
        have zero or exactly one bug associated with a test run.

        * public/admin/bug-trackers.php: Added the support for editing bug_url.
        * public/api/runs.php:
        (fetch_runs_for_config): Modified the query to fetch bugs associated with test_runs.
        (parse_bugs_array): Added. Parses the aggregated bugs and creates a dictionary that maps a tracker id to
        an associated bug if there is one.
        (format_run): Calls parse_bugs_array.

        * public/include/json-header.php: Added helper functions to deal for CSRF prevention.
        (ensure_privileged_api_data): Added. Dies immediately if the request's method is not POST or doesn't
        have a valid JSON payload.
        (ensure_privileged_api_data_and_token): Ditto. Also checks that the CSRF prevention token is valid.
        (compute_token): Computes a CSRF token using the REMOTE_USER (e.g. set via BasicAuth), the salt, and
        the expiration time stored in the cookie.
        (verify_token): Returns true iff the specified token matches what compute_token returns from the cookie.

        * public/include/manifest.php:
        (ManifestGenerator::bug_trackers): Include bug_url as bugUrl in the manifest. Also use tracker_id instead
        of tracker_name as the key in the manifest. This requires changes to both v1 and v2 front end.

        * public/v2/app.css:
        (.disabled .icon-button:hover g): Used by the "bugs" icon when a range of points or no points are
        selected in a chart.

        * public/v2/app.js:
        (App.PaneController.actions.toggleBugsPane): Added. Toggles the visibility of the bugs pane when exactly
        one point is selected in the chart. Also hides the search pane when making the bugs pane visible since
        they would overlap on each other if both of them are shown.
        (App.PaneController.actions.associateBug): Makes a privileged API request to associate the specified bug
        with the currently selected point (test run). Updates the bug information in "details" and colors of dots
        in the charts to reflect new states. Because chart data objects aren't real Ember objects for performance
        reasons, we have to use a dirty hack of modifying a dummy counter bugsChangeCount.
        (App.PaneController.actions.toggleSearchPane): Renamed from toggleSearch. Also hides the bugs pane when
        showing the search pane.
        (App.PaneController.actions.rangeChanged): Takes all selected points as the second argument instead of
        taking start and end points as the second and the third arguments so that _showDetails can enumerate all
        bugs in the selected range.

        (App.PaneController._detailsChanged): Added. Hide the bugs pane whenever a new point is selected.
        Also update singlySelectedPoint, which is used by toggleBugsPane and associateBug.
        (App.PaneController._currentItemChanged): Updated for the _showDetails change.
        (App.PaneController._showDetails): Takes an array of selected points in place of old arguments.
        Simplified the code to compute the revision information. Calls _updateBugs to format the associated bugs.
        (App.PaneController._updateBugs): Sets details.bugTrackers to a dictionary that maps a bug tracker id to
        a bug tracker proxy with an array of (bugNumber, bugUrl) pairs and also editedBugNumber, which is used by
        the bugs pane to associate or dissociate a bug number, if exactly one point is selected.

        (App.InteractiveChartComponent._updateDotsWithBugs): Added. Sets hasBugs class on dots as needed.
        (App.InteractiveChartComponent._setCurrentSelection): Finds and passes all points in the selected range
        to selectionChanged action instead of just finding the first and the last points.

        * public/v2/chart-pane.css: Updated the style.

        (PrivilegedAPI._post): Makes a single POST request to /privileged-api/* with a JSON payload.

        (Measurement.prototype.bugs): Added.
        (Measurement.prototype.hasBugs): Returns true iff bugs has more than one bug number.
        (Measurement.prototype.associateBug): Associates a bug with a test run via privileged-api/associate-bug.

        Perf dashboard should store commit logs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137510

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        For the v2 version of the perf dashboard, we would like to be able to see commit logs in the dashboard itself.

        This patch replaces "build_revisions" table with "commits" and "build_commits" relations to store commit logs,
        and add JSON APIs to report and retrieve them. It also adds a tools/pull-svn.py to pull commit logs from
        a subversion directory. The git version of this script will be added in a follow up patch.


        In the new database schema, each revision in each repository is represented by exactly one row in "commits"
        instead of one row for each build in "build_revisions". "commits" and "builds" now have a proper many-to-many
        relationship via "build_commits" relations.

        In order to migrate an existing instance of this application, run the following SQL commands:

        BEGIN;

        INSERT INTO commits (commit_repository, commit_revision, commit_time)
            (SELECT DISTINCT ON (revision_repository, revision_value)
                revision_repository, revision_value, revision_time FROM build_revisions);

        INSERT INTO build_commits (commit_build, build_commit) SELECT revision_build, commit_id
            FROM commits, build_revisions
            WHERE commit_repository = revision_repository AND commit_revision = revision_value;

        DROP TABLE build_revisions;

        COMMIT;


        The helper script to submit commit logs can be used as follows:

        python ./tools/pull-svn.py "WebKit" https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/ https://perf.webkit.org
            feeder-slave feeder-slave-password 60 "webkit-patch find-users"

        The above command will pull the subversion server at https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/ every 60 seconds
        to retrieve at most 10 commits, and submits the results to https://perf.webkit.org using "feeder-slave" and
        "feeder-slave-password" as the builder name and the builder password respectively.

        The last, optional, argument is the shell command to convert a subversion account to the corresponding username.
        e.g. "webkit-patch find-users rniwa@webkit.org" yields "Ryosuke Niwa" <rniwa@webkit.org> in the stdout.


        * init-database.sql: Replaced "build_revisions" relation with "commits" and "build_commits" relations.

        * public/api/commits.php: Added. Retrieves a list of commits based on arguments in its path of the form
            /api/commits/<repository-name>/<filter>. The behavior of this API depends on <filter> as follows:

            - Not specified - It returns every single commit for a given repository.
            - Matches "oldest" - It returns the commit with the oldest timestamp.
            - Matches "latest" - It returns the commit with the latest timestamp.
            - Matches "last-reported" - It returns the commit with the latest timestamp added via report-commits.php.
            - Is entirely alphanumeric - It returns the commit whose revision matches the filter.
            - Is of the form <alphanumeric>:<alphanumeric> or <alphanumeric>-<alphanumeric> - It retrieves the list
            of commits added via report-commits.php between two timestamps retrieved from commits whose revisions
            match the two alphanumeric values specified. Because it retrieves commits based on their timestamps,
            the list may contain commits that do not appear as neither hash's ancestor in git/mercurial.

        WebKitPerfMonitor: Y-axis adjustment is too aggressive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130937

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Previously, adjusted min. and max. were defined as the two standards deviations away from EWMA of measured
        results. This had two major problems:
        1. Two standard deviations can be too small to show the confidence interval for results.
        2. Sometimes baseline and target can be more than two standards deviations away.

        Fixed the bug by completely rewriting the algorithm to compute the interval. Instead of blindly using two
        standard deviations as margins, we keep adding quarter the standard deviation on each side until more than 90%
        of points lie in the interval or we've expanded 4 standard deviations. Once this condition is met, we reduce
        the margin on each side separately to reduce the empty space on either side.

        A more rigorous approach would involve computing least squared value of results with respect to intervals
        but that seems like an overkill for a simple UI problem; it's also computationally expensive.

        It added so much complexity with only theoretical extensibility of adding aggregators.  It turns out that
        many aggregators we'd like to add are a lot more complicated than ones that could be written under the current
        infrastructure, and we need to make the other aspects (e.g. the level of aggregations) a lot more extensible.

        We then proceed to generate the second header row with sub column names.

        When generating the actual content, we first generate all custom columns as they may have multiple rows in

        <rdar://problem/15889905> SafariPerfMonitor: there should be a way to merge and hide platforms

        Reviewed by Stephanie Lewis.

        Added /admin/platforms/ page to hide and merge platforms.

        Merging two platforms is tricky because we need to migrate test runs as well as some test configurations.
        Recall that each test (e.g. Dromaeo) can have many "test metrics" (e.g. MaxAllocations, EndAllocations),
        and they have a distinct "test configuration" for each platform (e.g. MaxAllocation on Mountain Lion), and
        each test configuration a distinct "test run" for each build.

        In order to merge platform A into platform B, we must migrate all test runs that belong to platform A via
        their test configurations into platform B.

        Suppose we're migrating a test run R for test configuration T_A in platform A for metric M. Since M exists
        independent of platforms, R should continue to relate to M through some test configuration. Unfortunately,
        we can't simply move T_A into platform B since we may already have a test configuration T_B for metric M
        in platform B, in which case R should relate to T_B instead.

        Thus, we first migrate all test runs for which we already have corresponding test configurations in the
        new platform. We then migrate the test configurations of the remaining test runs.

        * database/init-database.sql: Added platform_hidden.

        <rdar://problem/15867325> Perf dashboard is erroneously associating reported results with old revisions

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        The bug was caused by a build fix r57645. It attempted to treat multiple reports from the same builder
        for the same build number as a single build by ignoring build time. This was necessary to associate
        multiple reports by a single build - e.g. for different performance test suites - because the scripts
        we use to submit results computed its own "build time" when they're called.

        An unintended consequence of this change was revealed when we moved a buildbot master to the new machine
        last week; new reports were wrongfully associated with old build numbers.

        Fixed the bug by not allowing reports made more than 1 day after the initial build time to be assigned
        to the same build. Instead, we create a new build object for those reports. Since the longest set of
        tests we have only take a couple of hours to run, 24 hours should be more than enough.

        * database/init-database.sql: We can no longer constrain that each build number is unique to a builder
        or that build number and build time pair is unique. Instead, constrain the uniqueness of the tuple
        (builder, build number, build time).

        * public/api/report.php:
        (ReportProcessor::resolve_build_id): Look for any builds made within the past one day. Create a new build
        when no such build exists. This prevents a report from being associated with a very old build of the same
        build number.

        Also check that revision numbers or hashes match when we're adding revision info. This will let us catch
        a similar bug in the future sooner.

        SafariPerfMonitor: Introduce iteration groups

        Reviewed by Remy Demarest.

        In WebKit land, we're going to use multiple instances of DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner to amortize
        the runtime environment variances to get more stable results. And it's desirable to keep track of
        the instance of DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner used to generate each iteration value.

        This patch introduces "iteration groups" to keep track of this extra information.

        Instead of receiving a flat array of iteration values, we can now receive a two dimensional array where
        the outer array denotes iteration groups and each inner array contains iteration values for each group.


        * database/init-database.sql: Add iteration_group column.
        * public/api/report.php:
        (ReportProcessor::recursively_ensure_tests): Always use the two dimensional array internally.

        (ReportProcessor::aggregate): test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations now returns an associative array
        contains the list of values indexed by the iteration order and group sizes. Store the group size so
        that we can restore the iteration groups before passing it to node.js and restore them later.

        (ReportProcessor::test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations): Flatten iteration groups into an array
        of values and construct group_size array to restore the groups later in ReportProcessor::aggregate.

        Also check that each iteration group in each subtest are consistent with one another. To see why we need
        to do this, suppose we're aggregating two tests T1 and T2 with the following values. Then it's important
        that each iteration group in T1 and T2 have the same size:
        T1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
        T2 = [[6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

        so that the aggregated result (the sum in this case) can have the same groups as in:
        T  = [[7, 9], [11, 13, 15]]

        If some iteration groups in T1 and T2 had a different size as in:
        T1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
        T2 = [[6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

        Then iteration groups of the aggregated T is ambiguous.

        (ReportProcessor::compute_caches): Flatten iteration groups to compute caches (e.g. mean, stdev, etc...)
        (ReportProcessor::commit): Store iteration_group values.

        SafariPerfMonitor: Make it possible to add charts for all subtests or all platforms.

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        It is often desirable to see charts of a given test for all platforms, or to be able to see
        charts of all subtests on a given platform when trying to triage perf. regressions.

        Support this use case by adding the ability to do so on the charts page.

        Also, we used to disable items on the test list based on the platform chosen. This turned out
        to be a bad UI because in many situations you want to be able to compare results of the same test
        on multiple platforms.

        In this new UI, we have three select elements, each of which selects the following:
        1. Top-level test - Test suite such as Dromaeo
        2. Metric - Pages and subtests under the suite such as www.webkit.org for dom-modify:Runs
           (where dom-modify is the name of the subtest and Runs is a metric in that subtest) for Dromaeo.
        3. Platform - Mountain Lion, Qt, etc...

        A user can select "all" for metric and platform but we disallow doing both at once since adding
        all metrics on all platforms tends to add way too many charts and hang the browser. I also can't
        think of a use case where you want to look at that many charts at once. We can support this later
        if valid use cases come up.

        * public/index.html:
        (.showCharts.addOption): Extracted.
        (.showCharts): Added "metricList" that shows the list of test and metrics (in the form of
        relative metrics paths such as "DOMWalk:Time") for each top-level test selected in testList.
        metricList has onchange handler that enables/disables items on platformList.
        
        (init): Sort tests and test metrics here instead of doing that in showCharts.

        * public/api/report.php: Added.
        (ReportProcessor):
        (ReportProcessor.__construct):
        (ReportProcessor.process):

        (ReportProcessor.store_report_and_get_build_data): We store the report into the database as soon as it has been
        verified to be submitted by a known builder.

        (ReportProcessor.exit_with_error): Store the error message and details in the database if the report had been
        stored. If not, then notify that to the client via 'failureStored' in the JSON response.
        (ReportProcessor.resolve_build_id): Insert build and build_revisions rows if needed. We don't do this atomically
        inside a transaction because there could be multiple reports for a single build, each containing results for
        different tests.

        (ReportProcessor.recursively_ensure_tests): Parse a tree of tests and insert tests and test_metrics rows as
        needed. It also computes the metrics to aggregate and prepares values to commit via ensure_aggregated_metric,
        add_values_to_commit, and add_values_for_aggregation.

        (ReportProcessor.is_list_of_aggregators): When a metric is an aggregation, it contains an array of aggregator
        names, e.g. ["Arithmetic", "Geometric"], instead of a dictionary of configuration types to their values,
        e.g. {Time: {current: [1, 2, 3,]}}. This function detects the former. (Note that dictionary and list are both
        array's in PHP).

        (ReportProcessor.ensure_aggregated_metric): Create a metric with aggregator to add it to the list of metrics
        to be aggregated in ReportProcessor.aggregate.

        (ReportProcessor.add_values_for_aggregation): Called by test metrics with aggregated parent test metrics.

        (ReportProcessor.aggregate): Compute results for aggregated metrics. Consider a matrix with rows representing
        child tests and columns representing "iterations" for a given aggregated metrics M. Initially, we have values
        given for each row (child metrics of M). This function extracts each column (iteration) via
        test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations, and feeds it into evaluate_expressions_by_node to get aggregated values
        for each column (iteration of M). Finally, it registers those aggregated values to be committed.

        Note that we don't want to start a new node.js process for each aggregation, so we accumulate all values to be
        aggregated in node.js in $expressions. Each entry in $expressions is a JSON string that contains code and
        values to be aggregated. node.js gives us back a list of JSON strings that contain aggregated values.

        (ReportProcessor.test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations): See above.
        (ReportProcessor.evaluate_expressions_by_node): See above.

        (ReportProcessor.compute_caches): Compute cached mean, sum, and square sums for each run we're about to add
        using evaluate_expressions_by_node. We can't do this before computing aggregated results since those aggregated
        results also need the said caches.

        (ReportProcessor.add_values_to_commit):

        (ReportProcessor.commit): Add test_runs and run_iterations atomically inside a transaction, rolling back
        the transaction as needed if anything goes wrong.

        contiguously in a SQL statement.

        (Database.select_or_insert_row): Added. Selects a row if the attempt to insert the same row fails. It
        automatically creates a query string from a dictionary of unprefixed column names and table. It returns
        a column value of the choice.

        * public/index.html:
        (Chart.attachMainPlot): Disable auto highlighting (circle around a data point that shows up on hover)
        on the dashboard page as it's way too noisy.

        (Chart.hideTooltip): Added. Hides the tooltip that shows up on hover.

        (.toggleClickTooltip): Extracted from the code for "mouseout" bind (now replaced by "mouseleave").
        Pins or unpins a tooltip. When pinning a tooltip, we create a tooltip behind the scene and show that
        so that the tooltip for hover can be reused further.

        (.closestItemForPageX): Find the closest item given pageX. We iterate data points from left to right,
        and find the first point that lies on the right of the cursor position. We then compute the midpoint
        between this and the previous point and pick the closer of the two. It returns an item-like object
        that has all properties we need since flot doesn't provide an API to retrieve the real item object.

        (Chart): Call toggleClickTooltip when a (hover) tooltip is clicked.

        (Chart.attach): In "plothover" bind, call closestItemForPageX when item is not provided by flot on
        the first or "current" data points (as opposed to target or baseline data points).

        Also bind the code to clear crosshair and hide tooltips to "mouseleave" instead of "mouseout", and
        avoid triggering this code when the cursor is still within the plot's rectangle (e.g. when a cursor
        moves onto a tooltip) to avoid the premature dismissal of a tooltip.

        <rdar://problem/12897424> SafariPerfMonitor: Add ability to report results from bots

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        Add report.php and populate-from-report.js that process JSON files submitted by builders.

        * database/populate-from-report.js: Added.
        (main):
        (getReport): Obtains the payload (the actual report) from "jobs" table.
        (recursivelyEnsureTestsIdsAndMetricsIds): "reports.tests" contain a tree of tests, test metrics,
        and their results. This function recursively traverses tests and metrics and ensure their ids.
        (ensureTestId):
        (metricToUnit): Maps a metric name to a unit. This should really be done in the client side since
        there is no point in storing unit given that every metric maps to exactly one unit (i.e. the mapping
        is a "function" in mathematical sense).
        (ensureMetricId):
        (ensureRepositoryIdsForAllRevisions):
        (getIdOrCreateBuildWithRevisions):
        (ensureBuildIdAndRevisions): Obtains a build id given a builder name, a build number, and a build time
        if one already exists. If not, then inserts a new build and corresponding revisions information (e.g.
        build 123 may contain WebKit revision r456789). We don't retrieve rows for revisions since we don't use
        it elsewhere.
        (insertRun): Insert new rows into "test_runs" and "run_iterations" tables, thereby recording the new
        test results all in a single transaction. This allows us to keep the database consistent in that either
        a build has been reported or not at least in "test_runs" and "run_iterations" tables. It'll be ideal if
        we could do the same for "builds" and "build_revisions" but that's not a hard requirement as far as
        other parts of the application are concerned.
        (scheduleQueriesToInsertRun):
        * database/process-jobs.js: Add a call to populate-from-report.js.
        * public/api/report.php: Added. Adds a new job named "report" to be processed by populate-from-report.js.
        * public/include/db.php: Support parameterized query.
