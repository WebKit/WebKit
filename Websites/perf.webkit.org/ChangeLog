        Add mocha server tests for /api/build-requests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155831

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Added the new mocha.js based server-tests for /api/build-requests. The new harness automatically:
         - starts a new Apache instance
         - switches the database during testing via setting an environmental variable 
         - backups and restores public/data directory during testing

        As a result, developer no longer has to manually setup Apache, edit config.json manually to use
        a testing database, or run /api/manifest.php to re-generate the manifest file after testing.

        This patch also makes ID resolution optional on /api/build-requests so that v3 model based syncing
        scripts can re-use the same code as the v3 UI to process the JSON. tools/sync-with-buildbot.py has
        been modified to use this option (useLegacyIdResolution).

        * config.json: Added configurations for the test httpd server.
        * init-database.sql: Don't error when tables and types don't exist (when database is empty).
        * public/api/build-requests.php:
        (main): Made the ID resolution optional with useLegacyIdResolution. Also removed "updates" from the
        results JSON since it's never used.

        (BuildRequestsFetcher::__construct):

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        The bug was caused by InteractiveTimeSeriesChart invoking onchange callback whenever mouse moved even
        if the current point didn't change. Fixed the bug by avoiding the work if the indicator hadn't changed
        and avoiding work in the commit log viewer when the requested repository and the revision range were
        the same as those of the last request.

        (CommitLogViewer):
        (CommitLogViewer.prototype.currentRepository): Exit early when repository and the revision range are

        (ChartPane.prototype._indicatorDidChange): Fixed the bug that unlocking the indicator wouldn't update
        the URL. We need to check whether the lock state had changed. The old condition was also redundant
        since _mainChartIndicatorWasLocked is always identically equal to isLocked per the prior assignment.

        v3 UI sometimes don't update the list of revisions on the commit log viewer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155729

        Rubber-stamped by Chris Dumez.

        Fixed multiple bugs that were affecting the list of blame range and commit logs for the range weren't
        updated in some cases on v3 UI. Also, the commit log viewer state is now a part of the URL state so
        opening and closing the commit log viewer will persist across page loads.

        Also fixed a regression from r198479 that Test object can't be created for a top level test.

        expansion mark (>>). Also fixed click handler from the row since this made selecting revision range
        on the view cumbersome. Now user has to explicitly click on the expansion mark (>>).
        (ChartPaneStatusView.prototype._setRevisionRange): Now takes shouldNotify, from, and to as arguments
        as this function must not invoke_revisionCallback inside _updateRevisionListForNewCurrentRepository.
        (ChartPaneStatusView.prototype.moveRepositoryWithNotification): Use newly added setCurrentRepository
        instead of manually invoking setCurrentRepository and updateRevisionListWithNotification.
        (ChartPaneStatusView.prototype.setCurrentRepository): Fixed the bug that we weren't updating the
        blame list here.
        (ChartPaneStatusView.prototype.updateRevisionList): Renamed from updateRevisionListWithNotification
        since we no longer call _revisionCallback. In general, callbacks are only meant to communicate user
        initiated actions, and not program induced updates like this API so this was a bad pattern anyway.
        ChartPane now explicitly updates the commit log viewer instead of relying on this function calling
        _requestOpeningCommitViewer implicitly.
        (ChartPaneStatusView.prototype._updateRevisionListForNewCurrentRepository): Extracted from
        updateRevisionListWithNotification so that setCurrentRepository can also call this function.

        The analysis results viewer on v3 UI sometimes treats regressions as progressions and vice versa when
        the first set (i.e. set A) of the revisions used in an A/B testing never appears in the original graph,
        and its latest commit time matches that of the second set, which appears in the original graph.

        Because the analysis results viewer compares results in the increasing row number, this results in
        B to be compared to A instead of A to be compared to B. Fixed the bug by preventing the wrong ordering

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Added mocha unit tests for MeasurementSet and MeasurementAdapter classes along with the necessary
        refactoring to run these tests in node.

        getJSON and getJSONStatus are now under RemoteAPI so that unit tests can mock them.

        Removed the dependency on v2 UI's TimeSeries and Measurement class by adding a new implementation
        of TimeSeries in v3 and removing the dependency on Measurement in chart-pane-status-view.js with
        new helper methods on Build and CommitLog.

        Many js files now use 'use strict' (node doesn't support class syntax in non-strict mode) and
        module.exports to export symbols in node's require function.

        v3 UI should allow custom revisions for A/B testing
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154379

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Added the capability to customize revisions selected in the overview chart and the results viewer.

        Newly added CustomizableTestGroupForm is responsible for allowing users to modify the set of revisions in
        a new A/B testing group. Unlike TestGroupForm which doesn't know anything about which revisions are selected
        for each project/repository, CustomizableTestGroupForm is aware of the list of revisions used in each set.

        The list of revisions used in each set is represented by RootSet if users had not customized them, and
        CustomRootSet otherwise; the latter was added since regular RootSet object requires CommitLog and other
        DataModelObjects which are hard to create without corresponding database entries.

        A/B testing results should be visualized intuitively on v3 UI
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152496

        Rubber-stamped by Chris Dumez.

        Add the "stacking block" view of A/B testing results to the analysis task page on v3 UI.

        The patch enhances JSON APIs at /api/analysis-task /api/measurement-set/ to reduce the number of
        HTTP requests, and adds two UI components: TestGroupResultsTable and AnalysisResultsViewer both
        of which inherits from an abstract superclass: ResultsTable.

        ResultsTable provides a tabular presentation of measured values in regular measurement sets and
        A/B testing results using groups of bar graphs created by BarGraphGroup. TestGroupResultsTable
        inherits from this class to display A/B testing configurations and the averaged results for each
        configuration, and AnalysisResultsViewer inherits from it to provide an intuitive visualization
        of the outcomes of all A/B testing results associated with a given analysis task.

        * public/api/analysis-tasks.php:
        (main): Add the capability to find the analysis task based on its build request.
        This allows /v3/#/analysis/task/?buildRequest=<id> to be hyperlinked on buildbot page.

        * public/api/measurement-set.php:
        (main): Removed the unused startTime and endTime, and added "analysisTask" to query parameters.
        (AnalysisResultsFetcher): Added. Used to fetch measured data associated with every build request
        on an analysis task.
        (AnalysisResultsFetcher::__construct):
        (AnalysisResultsFetcher::fetch): Unlike MeasurementSetFetcher, we fetch the list of commits and
        list of measurements separately since there will be a lot less builds and commits than measured
        data (since we're fetching measured values for all tests and their metrics).
        (AnalysisResultsFetcher::fetch_commits): Fetches commits.
        (AnalysisResultsFetcher::format_measurement): Like MeasurementSetFetcher::format_measurement but
        with config_type and config_metric since we're returning measured data for all metrics and test
        configurations.
        (AnalysisResultsFetcher::format_map): Similar to MeasurementSetFetcher::format_map.

        * public/v3/components/analysis-results-viewer.js: Added.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer): Added. 
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.prototype.didUpdateResults): This callback is called by AnalysisTaskPage
        when A/B testing results become available.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.prototype.render): Overrides ResultsTable's render to highlight the block
        representing the currently selected test group.

        (AnalysisResultsViewer.prototype.buildRowGroups): Creates a list of rows with "stacking blocks"
        that visualizes A/B testing results. The algorithm works as follows: 1. Create all table rows.
        2. Find which row is associated with each set in each test group. 3. Layout "blocks".

        (AnalysisResultsViewer.prototype._collectRootSetsInTestGroups): Collects root sets from all data
        in the measurement set as well as A/B testing **requests** (results may contain more repositories
        than requested but they aren't interesting for the purpose of visualizing results for the entire
        analysis task).

        (AnalysisResultsViewer.prototype._buildRowsForPointsAndTestGroups): Create table rows. First,
        create table rows for measurement set points that have a matching test group (i.e. either set A
        or set B of an A/B testing uses the same root set as a point). Second, insert a new row for each
        root set in each test group which didn't find a matching measurement set point. There is a little
        subtlety that some A/B testing may specify revisions for a subset of repositories and/or some A/B
        testing results may appear as if it goes back in time with respect to other A/B testing results.
        For example, consider creating two A/B test groups for WebKit changes and OS changes separately.
        There could be no coherent linearization of those two A/B testing in which both WebKit and OS
        versions move forward.

        (AnalysisResultsViewer.RootSetInTestGroup): Added. Represents a pair (test group, root set) since
        a root set could be shared by multiple test groups.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingBlock): Added. A stacked block representing a test group.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingBlock.prototype.addRowIndex): Associates a row number with
        either set A or set B.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingBlock.prototype.createStackingCell): Creates a table cell
        for this block.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingBlock.prototype.isThin): Returns true if this test group
        has failed and this block should look "thin" without any label.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingBlock.prototype._computeTestGroupStatus): Computes the
        status for this test group.

        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingGrid): Added. AnalysisResultsViewer uses this class to
        layout blocks representing test groups.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingGrid.prototype.insertBlockToColumn): Inserts a new block
        to layout. We keep all test groups doing the same A/B test next to each other.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingGrid.prototype.layout): Layouts each block / test group
        in the order they are created.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingGrid.prototype._layoutBlock): Places the block in the
        left-most column that can accommodate it while avoiding columns of a different thin-ness. A column
        is thin if its A/B testing has failed, and not thin otherwise.
        (AnalysisResultsViewer.TestGroupStackingGrid.prototype.createCellsForRow): Creates table cells for
        a given row. For each column, generate a table cell if we're in the first row and the first block
        starts in a later row, a block starts in the current row, or the last block ended in the previous
        row and the next block or the last row appears later.

        * public/v3/components/bar-graph-group.js: Added. A component for showing a group of bar graphs.
        (BarGraphGroup): Added. Creates a group of bar graphs with the same value range. It's used by
        AnalysisResultsViewer and ResultsTable to show bar graphs to compare values.
        (SingleBarGraph): A component created and collectively controlled by BarGraphGroup.

        * public/v3/components/results-table.js: Added.
        (ResultsTable): An abstract superclass for TestGroupResultsTable and AnalysisResultsViewer.

        (ResultsTable.prototype.render): Renders the table. 1. Call "buildRowGroups()" implemented by
        a subclass to obtain the list of rows. 2. Compute the list of repositories to show. 3. For each
        cell in the table, compute the number of rows to show the same value (for rowspan). 4. Render the
        table with an extra list of repositories if exists.

        (ResultsTable.prototype._computeRepositoryList): Compute the list of repositories to list
        revisions in the table. Omit repositories not present in any row or for which all rows have the
        same revision. In the latter case, include it in the extra repositories listed below the table.
        This minimizes the amount of redundant information presented to the user.

        (ResultsTableRow): Added. Represents a single row in the table. ResultsTable constructs necessary
        table cells to tabulate the associated root sets, and shows the associated result using a grouped
        bar graph. Additional columns are used by AnalysisResultsViewer to show stacked blocks for A/B
        testing groups.

        (LabeledObject):

        * public/v3/models/measurement-adaptor.js: Added.
        (MeasurementAdaptor): Extracted from MeasurementCluster. This class is responsible for

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        The bug was caused by the last modified date in measurement set JSON being a string instead of a POSIX timestamp,
        which prevented the v3 UI from invalidating the cache. Specifically, the following boolean logic always evaluated
        to false because +data['lastModified'] was NaN in MeasurementSet.prototype._fetch (/v3/models/measurement-set.js):

        !clusterEndTime && useCache && +data['lastModified'] < self._lastModified

        Add v3 UI to perf dashboard
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152311

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        Add the third iteration of the perf dashboard UI. UI for viewing and modifying analysis tasks is coming soon.
        The v3 UI is focused on speed, and removes all third-party script dependencies including jQuery, d3, and Ember.
        Both the DOM-based UI and graphing are implemented manually.


        The entire app is structured using new component library implemented in components/base.js. Each component is
        an instance of a subclass of ComponentBase which owns a single DOM element. Each subclass may supply static
        methods named htmlTemplate and cssTemplate as the template for a component instance. ComponentBase automatically
        clones the templates inside the associated element (or its shadow root on the supported browsers). Each subclass
        must supply a method called "render()" which constructs and updates the DOM as needed.

        There is a special component called Page, which represents an entire page. Each Page is opened by PageRouter's
        "route()" function. Each subclass of Page supplies "open()" for initialization and "updateFromSerializedState()"
        for a hash URL transition.


        The key feature of the v3 UI is the split of time series into chunks called clusters (see r194120). On an internal
        instance of the dashboard, the v2 UI downloads 27MB of data whereas the same page loads only 3MB of data in the v3.
        The key logic for fetching time series in chunks is implemented by MeasurementSet in /v3/models/measurement-set.js.
        We first fetch the cached primary cluster (the cluster that contains the newest data) at:
        /data/measurement-set-<platform-id>-<metric-id>.json

        If that's outdated according to lastModified in manifest.json, then we immediately re-fetch the primary cluster at:
        /api/measurement-set/?platform=<platform-id>&metric=<metric-id>

        Once the up-to-date primary cluster is fetched, we fetch all "secondary" clusters. For each cluster being fetched,
        including the primary, we invoke registered callbacks.


        In addition, the v3 UI reduces the initial page load time by loading a single bundled JS file generated by
        tools/bundle-v3-scripts.py. index.html has a fallback to load all 44 JS files individually during development.

        * public/api/analysis-tasks.php:
        (fetch_and_push_bugs_to_tasks): Added the code to fetch start and end run times. This is necessary in V3 UI
        because no longer fetch the entire time series. See r194120 for the new measurement set JSON API.

        Rubber-stamped by Chris Dumez.

        The new API JSON allows the front end to fetch measured data in chunks called a "cluster" as specified
        in config.json for each measurement set specified by the pair of a platform and a metric.

        When the front end needs measured data in a given time range (t_0, t_1) for a measurement set, it first
        fetches the primary cluster by /api/measurement-set/?platform=<platform-id>&metric=<metric-id>.
        The primary cluster is the last cluster in the set (returning the first cluster here is not useful
        since we don't typically show very old data), and provides the information needed to fetch other clusters.

        Fetching the primary cluster also creates JSON files at:
        /data/measurement-set-<platform-id>-<metric-id>-<cluster-end-time>.json
        to allow latency free access for secondary clusters. The front end code can also fetch the cache of
        the primary cluster at: /data/measurement-set-<platform-id>-<metric-id>.json.

        Because the front end code has to behave as if all data is fetched, each cluster contains one data point
        immediately before the first data point and one immediately after the last data point. This avoids having
        to fetch multiple empty clusters for manually specified baseline data. To support this behavior, we generate
        all clusters for a given measurement set at once when the primary cluster is requested.

        Furthermore, all measurement sets are divided at the same time into clusters so that the boundary of clusters
        won't shift as more data are reported to the server.

        In addition, change the server config JSON's format to include scheme, host, and port numbers separately

        Add time series segmentation algorithms as moving averages
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143362

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        This patch implements two preliminary time series segmentation algorithms as moving averages.

        Recursive t-test: Compute Welch's t-statistic at each point in a given segment of the time series.
        If Welch's t-test implicates a statistically significance difference, then split the segment into two
        sub segments with the maximum t-statistic (i.e. the point at which if split would yield the highest
        probability that two segments do not share the same "underlying" mean in classical / frequentist sense).
        We repeat this process recursively. See [1] for the evaluation of this particular algorithm.

        Schwarz criterion: Use Schwarz or Bayesian information criterion to heuristically find the optimal
        segmentation. Intuitively, the problem of finding the best segmentation comes down to minimizing the
        residual sum of squares in each segment as in linear regressions. That is, for a given segment with
        values y_1 through y_n with mean y_avg, we want to minimize the sum of (y_i - y_avg)^2 over i = 1
        through i = n. However, we also don't want to split every data point into a separate segment so we need
        to account the "cost" of introducing new segments. We use a cost function that's loosely based on two
        models discussed in [2] for simplicity. We will tune this cost function further in the future.

        The problem of finding the best segmentation then reduces to a search problem. Unfortunately, our problem
        space is exponential with respect to the size of the time series since we could split at each data point.
        We workaround this problem by first splitting the time series into a manageable smaller grids, and only
        considering segmentation of a fixed size (i.e. the number of segments is constant). Since time series
        tend to contain a lot more data points than segments, this strategy finds the optimal solution without
        exploring much of the problem space.

        Finding the optimal segmentation of a fixed size is, itself, another search problem that is equivalent to
        finding the shortest path of a fixed length in DAG. Here, we use dynamic programming with a matrix of size
        n by n where n is the length of the time series (grid). Each entry in this matrix at (i, k) stores
        the minimum cost of segmenting data points 1 through i using k segments. We start our search at i = 1.
        Clearly C(1, 0) = 0 (note the actual code uses 0-based index). In i-th iteration, we compute the cost
        S(i, j) of each segment starting at i and ending at another point j after i and update C(j, k + 1) by
        min( C(j, k + 1), C(i, k) + S(i, j) ) for all values of j above i.

        REGRESSION: Searching commits can highlight wrong data points
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143272

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        The bug was caused by /api/commits returning commit times with millisecond precision whereas /api/runs
        return commit times with only second precision. This resulted in the frontend code to match a commit
        with the data point that included the next commit when the millisecond component of commit's timestamp
        wasn't identically 0.

        This discrepancy was caused by the fact PHP's strtotime only ignores milliseconds and /api/commits
        was returning timestamp as string instead of parsing via Database::to_js_time as done in /api/runs
        so miliseconds component was only preserved in /api/commits.

        it returns time in milisecond precision.

        This patch introduces the caches of JSON files returned by /api/ in /data/ directory. It also records
        the last time test_runs rows associated with the requested platforms and metrics are inserted, updated,
        or removed in the caches as well as the manifest JSON files ("last modified time"). Because the manifest
        is regenerated each time a new test result is reported, the front end can compare last modified time in
        the manifest file with that in a /api/runs JSON cache to detect the stale-ness.

        More concretely, the front end first optimistically fetches the JSON in /data/. If the cache doesn't exit
        or the last modified time in the cache doesn't match with that in the manifest file, it would fetch it
        again via /api/runs. In the case the cache did exist, we render the charts based on the cache meanwhile.
        This dramatically reduces the perceived latency for the page load since charts are drawn immediately using
        the cache and we would only re-render the charts as new up-to-date JSON comes in.

        This patch also changes the format of runs JSONs by pushing the exiting properties into 'configurations'
        and adding 'lastModified' and 'elapsedTime' at the top level.

        New perf dashboard should have the ability to overlay moving average with an envelope
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141438

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        This patch adds three kinds of moving average strategies and two kinds of enveloping strategies:

        Simple Moving Average - The moving average x̄_i of x_i is computed as the arithmetic mean of values
        from x_(i - n) though x_(i + m) where n is a non-negative integer and m is a positive integer. It takes
        n, backward window size, and m, forward window size, as an argument.

        Cumulative Moving Average - x̄_i is computed as the arithmetic mean of all values x_0 though x_i.
        That is, x̄_1 = x_1 and x̄_i = ((i - 1) * M_(i - 1) + x_i) / i for all i > 1.

        Exponential Moving Average - x̄_i is computed as the weighted average of x_i and x̄_(i - 1) with α as
        an argument specifying x_i's weight. To be precise, x̄_1 = x_1 and x̄_i = α * x_i + (α - 1) x̄_(i-1).


        Average Difference - The enveloping delta d is computed as the arithmetic mean of the difference
        between each x_i and x̄_i.

        Moving Average Standard Deviation - d is computed like the standard deviation except the deviation
        for each term is measured from the moving average instead of the sample arithmetic mean. i.e. it uses
        the average of (x_i - x̄_i)^2 as the "sample variance" instead of the conventional (x_i - x̄)^2 where
        x̄ is the sample mean of all x_i's. This change was necessary since our time series is non-stationary.


        Each strategy is cloned for an App.Pane instance so that its parameterList can be configured per pane.
        The configuration of the currently chosen strategies is saved in the query string for convenience.

        Also added the "stat pane" to choose a moving average strategy and a enveloping strategy in each pane.

        * public/v2/app.css: Specify the fill color for all SVG groups in the pane toolbar icons.

        * public/v2/app.js:
        (App.Pane._fetch): Delegate the creation of 'chartData' to _computeChartData.

        (App.Pane._cloneStrategy): Added. Clones a strategy for a new pane.

        moving average and its envelope overlapping on top of it.

        * public/v2/index.html: Added the templates for the stat pane and the corresponding icon (Σ).

        * public/v2/interactive-chart.js:
        (App.InteractiveChartComponent.chartDataDidChange): Unset _totalWidth and _totalHeight to avoid exiting
        early inside _updateDimensionsIfNeeded when chartData changes after the initial layout.
        (App.InteractiveChartComponent.didInsertElement): Attach event listeners here instead of inside
        _constructGraphIfPossible since that could be called multiple times on the same SVG element.
        (App.InteractiveChartComponent._constructGraphIfPossible): Clear down the old SVG element we created
        but don't bother removing individual paths and circles. Added the code to show the moving average time
        series when there is one. Also add "foreground" class on SVG elements for the current time series when
        we're not showing the moving average. chart-pane.css has been updated to "dim down" the current time
        series when "foreground" is not set.

        Perf dashboard should have the ability to post A/B testing builds
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140317

        Rubber-stamped by Simon Fraser.

        This patch adds the support for triggering A/B testing from the perf dashboard.

        We add a few new tables to the database. "build_triggerables", which represents a set of builders
        that accept A/B testing. "triggerable_repositories" associates each "triggerable" with a fixed set
        of repositories for which an arbitrary revision can be specified for A/B testing.
        "triggerable_configurations" specifies a triggerable available on a given test on a given platform.
        "roots" table which specifies the revision used in a given root set in each repository.

        * init-database.sql: Added "build_triggerables", "triggerable_repositories",
        "triggerable_configurations", and "roots" tables. Added references to "build_triggerables",
        "platforms", and "tests" tables as well as columns to store status, status url, and creation time
        to build_requests table. Also made each test group's name unique in a given analysis task as it
        would be confusing to have multiple test groups of the same name.

        * public/admin/tests.php: Added the UI and the code to associate a test with a triggerable.

        * public/admin/triggerables.php: Added. Manages the list of triggerables as well as repositories
        for which a specific revision can be set in an A/B testing on a given triggerable.

        * public/api/build-requests.php: Added. Returns the list of open build requests on a specified
        triggerable. Also updates the status' and the status urls of specified build requests when
        buildRequestUpdates is provided in the raw POST data.
        (main):

        * public/api/runs.php:
        (fetch_runs_for_config): Don't include results associated with a build request, meaning they are
        results of an A/B testing.

        * public/api/test-groups.php:
        (main): Use the newly added BuildRequestsFetcher. Also merged fetch_test_groups_for_task back.

        * public/api/triggerables.php: Added.

        and root sets used in those requests.D

        (Database::insert_row): Support taking an empty array for values. This is useful in "root_sets"
        table since it only has the primary key, id, column.
        (Database::select_or_insert_row):
        (Database::update_or_insert_row):
        (Database::update_row): Added.
        (Database::_select_update_or_insert_row): Takes an extra argument specifying whether a new row
        should be inserted when no row matches the specified criteria. This is used while updating
        build_requests' status and url in public/api/build-requests.php since we shouldn't be inserting
        new build requests in that API.
        (Database::select_rows): Also use "1 == 1" in the select query when the query criteria is empty.
        This is used in public/api/triggerables.php when no analysis task is specified.

        * public/include/json-header.php:
        (find_triggerable_for_task): Added. Finds a triggerable available on a given test. We return the
        triggerable associated with the closest ancestor of the test. Since issuing a new query for each
        ancestor test is expensive, we retrieve triggerable for all ancestor tests at once and manually
        find the closest ancestor with a triggerable.

        * public/include/report-processor.php:
        (ReportProcessor::process):

        (TestNameResolver::map_metrics_to_tests): Store the entire metric row instead of its name so that
        test_exists_on_platform can use it. The last diff in public/admin/tests.php adopts this change.
        (TestNameResolver::test_exists_on_platform): Added. Returns true iff the test has ever run on
        a given platform.

        * public/include/test-path-resolver.php: Added.
        (TestPathResolver): This class abstracts the ancestor chains of a test. It retrieves the entire
        "tests" table to do this since there could be arbitrary number of ancestors for a given test.
        This class is a lot more lightweight than TestNameResolver, which retrieves a whole bunch of tables
        in order to compute full test metric names.
        (TestPathResolver::__construct):
        (TestPathResolver::ancestors_for_test): Returns the ordered list of ancestors from the closest to
        the highest (a test without a parent).
        (TestPathResolver::path_for_test): Returns a test "path", the ordered list of test names from
        the highest ancestor to the test itself.
        (TestPathResolver::ensure_id_to_test_map): Fetches "tests" table to construct id_to_test_map.

        * public/privileged-api/create-test-group.php: Added. An API to create A/B testing groups.
        (main):
        (commit_sets_from_root_sets): Given a dictionary of repository names to a pair of revisions
        for sets A and B respectively, returns a pair of arrays, each of which contains the corresponding
        set of "commits" for sets A and B respectively. e.g. {"WebKit": [1, 2], "Safari": [3, 4]} will
        result in [[WebKit commit at r1, Safari commit at r3], [WebKit commit at r2, Safari commit at r4]].

        * public/v2/analysis.js:
        (App.AnalysisTask.testGroups): Takes arguments so that set('testGroups') will invalidate the cache.
        (App.AnalysisTask.triggerable): Added. Retrieves the triggerable associated with the task lazily.
        (App.TestGroup.rootSets): Added. Returns the list of root set ids used in this A/B testing group.
        (App.TestGroup.create): Added. Creates a new A/B testing group.
        (App.Triggerable): Added.

        (App.TriggerableAdapter.buildURL): Added.
        (App.BuildRequest.testGroup): Renamed from group.
        (App.BuildRequest.orderLabel): Added. One-based index to be used in labels.
        (App.BuildRequest.config): Added. Returns either 'A' or 'B' depending on the configuration used
        in this build request.
        (App.BuildRequest.status): Added.
        (App.BuildRequest.statusLabel): Added. Returns a human friendly label for the current status.
        (App.BuildRequest): Removed buildNumber, buildBuilder, as well as buildTime as they're unused.

        * public/v2/app.js:
        (App.AnalysisTaskController.testGroups): Added.
        (App.AnalysisTaskController.possibleRepetitionCounts): Added.
        (App.AnalysisTaskController.updateRoots): Renamed from roots. This is also no longer a property
        but an observer that updates "roots" property. Filter out the repositories that are not accepted
        by the associated triggerable as they will be ignored.
        (App.AnalysisTaskController.actions.createTestGroup): Added.

        * public/v2/index.html: Updated the UI, and added a form element to trigger createTestGroup action.

        * tools/sync-with-buildbot.py: Added. This scripts posts new builds on buildbot and reports back
        the status of those builds to the perf dashboard. A similar script can be written to support
        other continuous builds systems.
        (main): Fetches the list of pending builds as well as currently running or completed builds from
        a buildbot, and report new statuses of builds requests to the perf dashboard. It will then schedule
        a single new build on each builder with no pending builds, and marks the set of open build requests
        that have been scheduled to run on the buildbot but not found in the first step as stale.
        (load_config): Loads a JSON that contains the configurations for each builder. e.g.
        [
            {
                "platform": "mac-mavericks",
                "test": ["Parser", "html5-full-render.html"],
                "builder": "Trunk Syrah Production Perf AB Tests",
                "arguments": {
                    "forcescheduler": "force-mac-mavericks-release-perf",
                    "webkit_revision": "$WebKit",
                    "jobid": "$buildRequest"
                }
            }
        ]

        (find_request_updates): Return a list of build request status updates to make based on the pending
        builds as well as in-progress and completed builds on each builder on the buildbot. When a build is
        completed, we use the special status "failedIfNotCompleted" which results in "failed" status only
        if the build request had not been completed. This is necessary because a failed build will not
        report its failed-ness back to the perf dashboard in some cases; e.g. lost slave or svn up failure.
        (update_and_fetch_build_requests): Submit the build request status updates and retrieve the list
        of open requests the perf dashboard has.
        (find_stale_request_updates): Compute the list of build requests that have been scheduled on the
        buildbot but not found in find_request_updates. These build requests are lost. e.g. a master reboot
        or human canceling a build may trigger such a state.
        (schedule_request): Schedules a build with the arguments specified in the configuration JSON after
        replacing repository names with their revisions and buildRequest with the build request id.
        (config_for_request): Finds a builder for the test and the platform of a build request.
        (fetch_json): Fetches a JSON from the specified URL, optionally with BasicAuth.
        (property_value_from_build): Returns the value of a specific property in a buildbot build.
        (request_id_from_build): Returns the build request id of a given buildbot build if there is one.

        New perf dashboard should not duplicate author information in each commit
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139756

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Instead of each commit having author name and email, make it reference a newly added committers table.
        Also replace "email" by "account" since some repositories don't use emails as account names.

        This improves the keyword search performance in commits.php since LIKE now runs on committers table,
        which only contains as many rows as there are accounts in each repository, instead of commits table
        which contains every commit ever happened in each repository.

        BEGIN;

        INSERT INTO committers (committer_repository, committer_name, committer_email)

        The bugginess was caused by weird interactions between charts and panes. Rewrote the code to fix it.

        Superfluous selectionChanged and domainChanged "event" actions were removed from the interactive chart
        component. This is not how Ember.js components should interact to begin with. The component now exposes
        selectedPoints and always updates selection instead of sharedSelection.

        * public/v2/app.js:
        (App.ChartsController.present): Added. We can't call Date.now() in various points in our code as that
        would lead to infinite mutual recursions since X-axis domain values wouldn't match up.
        (App.ChartsController.updateSharedDomain): This function was completely useless. The overview's start
        and end time should be completely determined by "since" and the present time.
        (App.ChartsController._startTimeChanged): Ditto.
        (App.ChartsController._scheduleQueryStringUpdate):
        (App.ChartsController._updateQueryString): Set "zoom" only if it's different from the shared domain.

        (App.domainsAreEqual): Moved from InteractiveChartComponent._xDomainsAreSame.

        (App.PaneController.actions.createAnalysisTask): Use selectedPoints property set by the chart.
        (App.PaneController.actions.overviewDomainChanged): Removed; only needed to call updateSharedDomain.
        (App.PaneController.actions.rangeChanged): Removed. _showDetails (renamed to _updateDetails) directly
        observes the changes to selectedPoints property as it gets updated by the main chart.
        (App.PaneController._overviewSelectionChanged): This was previously a dead code. Now it's used again
        with a bug fix. When the overview selection is cleared, we use the same domain in the main chart and
        the overview chart.
        (App.PaneController._sharedDomainChanged): Fixed a but that it erroneously updates the overview domain
        when domain arrays aren't identical. This was causing a subtle race with other logic.
        (App.PaneController._sharedZoomChanged): Ditto. Also don't set mainPlotDomain here as any changes to
        overviewSelection will automatically propagate to the main plot's domain as they're aliased.
        (App.PaneController._currentItemChanged): Merged into _updateDetails (renamed from _showDetails).
        (App.PaneController._updateDetails): Previously, this function took points and inspected _hasRange to
        see if those two points correspond to a range or a single data point. Rewrote all that logic by
        directly observing selectedPoints and currentItem properties instead of taking points and relying on
        an instance variable, which was a terrible API.
        (App.PaneController._updateCanAnalyze): Use selectedPoints property. Since this property is only set
        when the main plot has a selected range, we don't have to check this._hasRange anymore.

        (App.InteractiveChartComponent._updateDomain): No longer sends domainChanged "event" action.

        New perf dashboard should provide UI to create a new analysis task
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138910

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        This patch reverts some parts of r175006 and re-introduces bugs associated with analysis tasks.
        I'll add UI to show and edit bug numbers associated with an analysis task in a follow up patch.

        With this patch, we can create a new analysis task by selection a range of points and opening
        "analysis pane" (renamed from "bugs pane"). Each analysis task created is represented by a yellow bar
        in the chart hyperlinked to the analysis task.

        * init-database.sql: Redefined the bugs to be associated with an analysis task instead of a test run.

        * public/api/analysis-tasks.php: Added the support for querying analysis tasks for a specific metric
        on a specific platform. Also retrieve and return all bugs associated with analysis tasks.
        (main):
        (fetch_and_push_bugs_to_tasks): Added. Fetches all bugs associated with an array of analysis tasks
        and adds the associated bugs to each task in the array.

        Perf dashboard should provide a way to associate bugs with a test run
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137857

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Added a "privileged" API, /privileged-api/associate-bug, to associate a bug with a test run.
        /privileged-api/ is to be protected by an authentication mechanism such as DigestAuth over https by
        the Apache configuration.


        The Cross Site Request (CSRF) Forgery prevention for privileged APIs work as follows. When a user is
        about to make a privileged API access, the front end code obtains a CSRF token generated by POST'ing
        to privileged-api/generate-csrf-token; the page sets a randomly generated salt and an expiration time
        via the cookie and returns a token computed from those two values as well as the remote username.

        The font end code then POST's the request along with the returned token. The server side code verifies
        that the specified token can be generated from the salt and the expiration time set in the cookie, and
        the token hasn't expired.


        * init-database.sql: Added bug_url to bug_trackers table, and added bugs table. Each bug tracker will
        have zero or exactly one bug associated with a test run.

        * public/admin/bug-trackers.php: Added the support for editing bug_url.
        * public/api/runs.php:
        (fetch_runs_for_config): Modified the query to fetch bugs associated with test_runs.
        (parse_bugs_array): Added. Parses the aggregated bugs and creates a dictionary that maps a tracker id to
        an associated bug if there is one.
        (format_run): Calls parse_bugs_array.

        * public/include/json-header.php: Added helper functions to deal for CSRF prevention.
        (ensure_privileged_api_data): Added. Dies immediately if the request's method is not POST or doesn't
        have a valid JSON payload.
        (ensure_privileged_api_data_and_token): Ditto. Also checks that the CSRF prevention token is valid.
        (compute_token): Computes a CSRF token using the REMOTE_USER (e.g. set via BasicAuth), the salt, and
        the expiration time stored in the cookie.
        (verify_token): Returns true iff the specified token matches what compute_token returns from the cookie.

        * public/include/manifest.php:
        (ManifestGenerator::bug_trackers): Include bug_url as bugUrl in the manifest. Also use tracker_id instead
        of tracker_name as the key in the manifest. This requires changes to both v1 and v2 front end.

        (App.PaneController.actions.toggleBugsPane): Added. Toggles the visibility of the bugs pane when exactly
        one point is selected in the chart. Also hides the search pane when making the bugs pane visible since
        they would overlap on each other if both of them are shown.
        (App.PaneController.actions.associateBug): Makes a privileged API request to associate the specified bug
        with the currently selected point (test run). Updates the bug information in "details" and colors of dots

        Perf dashboard should store commit logs
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137510

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        For the v2 version of the perf dashboard, we would like to be able to see commit logs in the dashboard itself.

        This patch replaces "build_revisions" table with "commits" and "build_commits" relations to store commit logs,
        and add JSON APIs to report and retrieve them. It also adds a tools/pull-svn.py to pull commit logs from
        a subversion directory. The git version of this script will be added in a follow up patch.


        In the new database schema, each revision in each repository is represented by exactly one row in "commits"
        instead of one row for each build in "build_revisions". "commits" and "builds" now have a proper many-to-many
        relationship via "build_commits" relations.

        In order to migrate an existing instance of this application, run the following SQL commands:

        BEGIN;

        INSERT INTO commits (commit_repository, commit_revision, commit_time)
            (SELECT DISTINCT ON (revision_repository, revision_value)
                revision_repository, revision_value, revision_time FROM build_revisions);

        INSERT INTO build_commits (commit_build, build_commit) SELECT revision_build, commit_id
            FROM commits, build_revisions
            WHERE commit_repository = revision_repository AND commit_revision = revision_value;

        DROP TABLE build_revisions;

        COMMIT;


        The helper script to submit commit logs can be used as follows:

        python ./tools/pull-svn.py "WebKit" https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/ https://perf.webkit.org
            feeder-slave feeder-slave-password 60 "webkit-patch find-users"

        The above command will pull the subversion server at https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/ every 60 seconds
        to retrieve at most 10 commits, and submits the results to https://perf.webkit.org using "feeder-slave" and
        "feeder-slave-password" as the builder name and the builder password respectively.

        The last, optional, argument is the shell command to convert a subversion account to the corresponding username.
        e.g. "webkit-patch find-users rniwa@webkit.org" yields "Ryosuke Niwa" <rniwa@webkit.org> in the stdout.


        * init-database.sql: Replaced "build_revisions" relation with "commits" and "build_commits" relations.

        * public/api/commits.php: Added. Retrieves a list of commits based on arguments in its path of the form
            /api/commits/<repository-name>/<filter>. The behavior of this API depends on <filter> as follows:

            - Not specified - It returns every single commit for a given repository.
            - Matches "oldest" - It returns the commit with the oldest timestamp.
            - Matches "latest" - It returns the commit with the latest timestamp.
            - Matches "last-reported" - It returns the commit with the latest timestamp added via report-commits.php.
            - Is entirely alphanumeric - It returns the commit whose revision matches the filter.
            - Is of the form <alphanumeric>:<alphanumeric> or <alphanumeric>-<alphanumeric> - It retrieves the list
            of commits added via report-commits.php between two timestamps retrieved from commits whose revisions
            match the two alphanumeric values specified. Because it retrieves commits based on their timestamps,
            the list may contain commits that do not appear as neither hash's ancestor in git/mercurial.

        WebKitPerfMonitor: Y-axis adjustment is too aggressive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130937

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Previously, adjusted min. and max. were defined as the two standards deviations away from EWMA of measured
        results. This had two major problems:
        1. Two standard deviations can be too small to show the confidence interval for results.
        2. Sometimes baseline and target can be more than two standards deviations away.

        Fixed the bug by completely rewriting the algorithm to compute the interval. Instead of blindly using two
        standard deviations as margins, we keep adding quarter the standard deviation on each side until more than 90%
        of points lie in the interval or we've expanded 4 standard deviations. Once this condition is met, we reduce
        the margin on each side separately to reduce the empty space on either side.

        A more rigorous approach would involve computing least squared value of results with respect to intervals
        but that seems like an overkill for a simple UI problem; it's also computationally expensive.

        <rdar://problem/15889905> SafariPerfMonitor: there should be a way to merge and hide platforms

        Reviewed by Stephanie Lewis.

        Added /admin/platforms/ page to hide and merge platforms.

        Merging two platforms is tricky because we need to migrate test runs as well as some test configurations.
        Recall that each test (e.g. Dromaeo) can have many "test metrics" (e.g. MaxAllocations, EndAllocations),
        and they have a distinct "test configuration" for each platform (e.g. MaxAllocation on Mountain Lion), and
        each test configuration a distinct "test run" for each build.

        In order to merge platform A into platform B, we must migrate all test runs that belong to platform A via
        their test configurations into platform B.

        Suppose we're migrating a test run R for test configuration T_A in platform A for metric M. Since M exists
        independent of platforms, R should continue to relate to M through some test configuration. Unfortunately,
        we can't simply move T_A into platform B since we may already have a test configuration T_B for metric M
        in platform B, in which case R should relate to T_B instead.

        Thus, we first migrate all test runs for which we already have corresponding test configurations in the
        new platform. We then migrate the test configurations of the remaining test runs.

        <rdar://problem/15867325> Perf dashboard is erroneously associating reported results with old revisions

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        The bug was caused by a build fix r57645. It attempted to treat multiple reports from the same builder
        for the same build number as a single build by ignoring build time. This was necessary to associate
        multiple reports by a single build - e.g. for different performance test suites - because the scripts
        we use to submit results computed its own "build time" when they're called.

        An unintended consequence of this change was revealed when we moved a buildbot master to the new machine
        last week; new reports were wrongfully associated with old build numbers.

        Fixed the bug by not allowing reports made more than 1 day after the initial build time to be assigned
        to the same build. Instead, we create a new build object for those reports. Since the longest set of
        tests we have only take a couple of hours to run, 24 hours should be more than enough.

        * database/init-database.sql: We can no longer constrain that each build number is unique to a builder
        or that build number and build time pair is unique. Instead, constrain the uniqueness of the tuple
        (builder, build number, build time).

        * public/api/report.php:
        (ReportProcessor::resolve_build_id): Look for any builds made within the past one day. Create a new build
        when no such build exists. This prevents a report from being associated with a very old build of the same
        build number.

        Also check that revision numbers or hashes match when we're adding revision info. This will let us catch
        a similar bug in the future sooner.

        SafariPerfMonitor: Introduce iteration groups

        Reviewed by Remy Demarest.

        In WebKit land, we're going to use multiple instances of DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner to amortize
        the runtime environment variances to get more stable results. And it's desirable to keep track of
        the instance of DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner used to generate each iteration value.

        This patch introduces "iteration groups" to keep track of this extra information.

        Instead of receiving a flat array of iteration values, we can now receive a two dimensional array where
        the outer array denotes iteration groups and each inner array contains iteration values for each group.


        * database/init-database.sql: Add iteration_group column.
        * public/api/report.php:
        (ReportProcessor::recursively_ensure_tests): Always use the two dimensional array internally.

        (ReportProcessor::aggregate): test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations now returns an associative array
        contains the list of values indexed by the iteration order and group sizes. Store the group size so
        that we can restore the iteration groups before passing it to node.js and restore them later.

        (ReportProcessor::test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations): Flatten iteration groups into an array
        of values and construct group_size array to restore the groups later in ReportProcessor::aggregate.

        Also check that each iteration group in each subtest are consistent with one another. To see why we need
        to do this, suppose we're aggregating two tests T1 and T2 with the following values. Then it's important
        that each iteration group in T1 and T2 have the same size:
        T1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
        T2 = [[6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

        so that the aggregated result (the sum in this case) can have the same groups as in:
        T  = [[7, 9], [11, 13, 15]]

        If some iteration groups in T1 and T2 had a different size as in:
        T1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
        T2 = [[6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

        Then iteration groups of the aggregated T is ambiguous.

        SafariPerfMonitor: Make it possible to add charts for all subtests or all platforms.

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        It is often desirable to see charts of a given test for all platforms, or to be able to see
        charts of all subtests on a given platform when trying to triage perf. regressions.

        Support this use case by adding the ability to do so on the charts page.

        Also, we used to disable items on the test list based on the platform chosen. This turned out
        to be a bad UI because in many situations you want to be able to compare results of the same test
        on multiple platforms.

        In this new UI, we have three select elements, each of which selects the following:
        1. Top-level test - Test suite such as Dromaeo
        2. Metric - Pages and subtests under the suite such as www.webkit.org for dom-modify:Runs
           (where dom-modify is the name of the subtest and Runs is a metric in that subtest) for Dromaeo.
        3. Platform - Mountain Lion, Qt, etc...

        A user can select "all" for metric and platform but we disallow doing both at once since adding
        all metrics on all platforms tends to add way too many charts and hang the browser. I also can't
        think of a use case where you want to look at that many charts at once. We can support this later
        if valid use cases come up.

        <rdar://problem/13316756> SafariPerfMonitor: tooltip should include a link to build URLs

        Reviewed by Remy Demarest and Ricky Mondello.

        Added a hyperlink to build page in tooltips. Repeating the entire build URL in each build
        was a bad idea because it bloats the resultant JSON file too much. So move the build URL
        templates to the manifest file instead. Each build now only contains the builder id.

        Made the list of bug trackers configurable. Namely, each bug tracker can be added in

        The association between bug trackers and repositories (such as WebKit, Safari, etc...) are used
        to determine the set of bug trackers to show for a given set of blame lists.
        e.g. if a test regressed due to a change in Safari, then we don't want to show WebKit Bugzilla as
        a place to file bugs against the regression.

        (ReportProcessor.is_list_of_aggregators): When a metric is an aggregation, it contains an array of aggregator
        names, e.g. ["Arithmetic", "Geometric"], instead of a dictionary of configuration types to their values,

        (ReportProcessor.aggregate): Compute results for aggregated metrics. Consider a matrix with rows representing
        child tests and columns representing "iterations" for a given aggregated metrics M. Initially, we have values
        given for each row (child metrics of M). This function extracts each column (iteration) via

        for each column (iteration of M). Finally, it registers those aggregated values to be committed.

        Note that we don't want to start a new node.js process for each aggregation, so we accumulate all values to be
        aggregated in node.js in $expressions. Each entry in $expressions is a JSON string that contains code and
        values to be aggregated. node.js gives us back a list of JSON strings that contain aggregated values.

        Make the generation of "runs" JSON dynamic and support test_metrics.

        Reviewed by Mark Rowe.

        It turned out that we can fetch all runs for a given configuration in roughly 100-200ms.

        Since there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of tests for each configuration and users
        aren't necessarily interested in looking at all test results, it's much more efficient to
        generate runs JSON dynamically (i.e. polling) upon a request instead of generating all of them
        when bots report new results (i.e. pushing).

        Rewrote the script to generate runs JSON in php and also supported test_metrics table.

        Reviewed by Mark Rowe.

        Make the migrator tool skip runs when fetching runs failed since webkit-perf.appspot.com is unreliable
        and we don't want to pause the whole importation process until the user comes back to decide whether
        to retry or not.

        Also place form controls next to each test in tests.php so that users don't have to scroll all the way
        down to make modifications.

        Finally, add unique constraint to (run_config, run_build) in test_runs table in order to optimize a query
        of the form: "SELECT run_id FROM test_runs WHERE run_config = $1 AND run_build = $2",
