        WebKitPerfMonitor: There should be a way to add all metrics of a suite without also adding subtests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131157

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Split "all metrics" into all metrics of a test suite and all subtests of the suite.
        This allows, for example, adding all metrics such as Arithmetic and Geometric for
        a given test suite without also adding its subtests.

        WebKitPerfMonitor: Tooltips cannot be pinned after using browser's back button
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131155

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The bug was caused by Chart.attach binding event listeners on plot container on each call.
        This resulted in the click event handler toggling the visiblity of the tooltip twice upon
        click when attach() has been called even number of times, keeping the tooltip invisible.

        Fixed the bug by extracting the code to bind event listeners outside of Chart.attach as
        a separate function, bindPlotEventHandlers, and calling it exactly once when Chart.attach
        is called for the first time.

        WebKitPerfMonitor: Y-axis adjustment is too aggressive
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130937

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Previously, adjusted min. and max. were defined as the two standards deviations away from EWMA of measured
        results. This had two major problems:
        1. Two standard deviations can be too small to show the confidence interval for results.
        2. Sometimes baseline and target can be more than two standards deviations away.

        Fixed the bug by completely rewriting the algorithm to compute the interval. Instead of blindly using two
        standard deviations as margins, we keep adding quarter the standard deviation on each side until more than 90%
        of points lie in the interval or we've expanded 4 standard deviations. Once this condition is met, we reduce
        the margin on each side separately to reduce the empty space on either side.

        A more rigorous approach would involve computing least squared value of results with respect to intervals
        but that seems like an overkill for a simple UI problem; it's also computationally expensive.

        <rdar://problem/15889905> SafariPerfMonitor: there should be a way to merge and hide platforms

        Reviewed by Stephanie Lewis.

        Added /admin/platforms/ page to hide and merge platforms.

        Merging two platforms is tricky because we need to migrate test runs as well as some test configurations.
        Recall that each test (e.g. Dromaeo) can have many "test metrics" (e.g. MaxAllocations, EndAllocations),
        and they have a distinct "test configuration" for each platform (e.g. MaxAllocation on Mountain Lion), and
        each test configuration a distinct "test run" for each build.

        In order to merge platform A into platform B, we must migrate all test runs that belong to platform A via
        their test configurations into platform B.

        Suppose we're migrating a test run R for test configuration T_A in platform A for metric M. Since M exists
        independent of platforms, R should continue to relate to M through some test configuration. Unfortunately,
        we can't simply move T_A into platform B since we may already have a test configuration T_B for metric M
        in platform B, in which case R should relate to T_B instead.

        Thus, we first migrate all test runs for which we already have corresponding test configurations in the
        new platform. We then migrate the test configurations of the remaining test runs.

        <rdar://problem/15867325> Perf dashboard is erroneously associating reported results with old revisions

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        The bug was caused by a build fix r57645. It attempted to treat multiple reports from the same builder
        for the same build number as a single build by ignoring build time. This was necessary to associate
        multiple reports by a single build - e.g. for different performance test suites - because the scripts
        we use to submit results computed its own "build time" when they're called.

        An unintended consequence of this change was revealed when we moved a buildbot master to the new machine
        last week; new reports were wrongfully associated with old build numbers.

        Fixed the bug by not allowing reports made more than 1 day after the initial build time to be assigned
        to the same build. Instead, we create a new build object for those reports. Since the longest set of
        tests we have only take a couple of hours to run, 24 hours should be more than enough.

        * database/init-database.sql: We can no longer constrain that each build number is unique to a builder
        or that build number and build time pair is unique. Instead, constrain the uniqueness of the tuple
        (builder, build number, build time).

        * public/api/report.php:
        (ReportProcessor::resolve_build_id): Look for any builds made within the past one day. Create a new build
        when no such build exists. This prevents a report from being associated with a very old build of the same
        build number.

        Also check that revision numbers or hashes match when we're adding revision info. This will let us catch
        a similar bug in the future sooner.

        SafariPerfMonitor: Introduce iteration groups

        Reviewed by Remy Demarest.

        In WebKit land, we're going to use multiple instances of DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner to amortize
        the runtime environment variances to get more stable results. And it's desirable to keep track of
        the instance of DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner used to generate each iteration value.

        This patch introduces "iteration groups" to keep track of this extra information.

        Instead of receiving a flat array of iteration values, we can now receive a two dimensional array where
        the outer array denotes iteration groups and each inner array contains iteration values for each group.


        * database/init-database.sql: Add iteration_group column.
        * public/api/report.php:
        (ReportProcessor::recursively_ensure_tests): Always use the two dimensional array internally.

        (ReportProcessor::aggregate): test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations now returns an associative array
        contains the list of values indexed by the iteration order and group sizes. Store the group size so
        that we can restore the iteration groups before passing it to node.js and restore them later.

        (ReportProcessor::test_value_list_to_values_by_iterations): Flatten iteration groups into an array
        of values and construct group_size array to restore the groups later in ReportProcessor::aggregate.

        Also check that each iteration group in each subtest are consistent with one another. To see why we need
        to do this, suppose we're aggregating two tests T1 and T2 with the following values. Then it's important
        that each iteration group in T1 and T2 have the same size:
        T1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
        T2 = [[6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

        so that the aggregated result (the sum in this case) can have the same groups as in:
        T  = [[7, 9], [11, 13, 15]]

        If some iteration groups in T1 and T2 had a different size as in:
        T1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
        T2 = [[6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

        Then iteration groups of the aggregated T is ambiguous.

        SafariPerfMonitor: Make it possible to add charts for all subtests or all platforms.

        Reviewed by Ricky Mondello.

        It is often desirable to see charts of a given test for all platforms, or to be able to see
        charts of all subtests on a given platform when trying to triage perf. regressions.

        Support this use case by adding the ability to do so on the charts page.

        Also, we used to disable items on the test list based on the platform chosen. This turned out
        to be a bad UI because in many situations you want to be able to compare results of the same test
        on multiple platforms.

        In this new UI, we have three select elements, each of which selects the following:
        1. Top-level test - Test suite such as Dromaeo
        2. Metric - Pages and subtests under the suite such as www.webkit.org for dom-modify:Runs
           (where dom-modify is the name of the subtest and Runs is a metric in that subtest) for Dromaeo.
        3. Platform - Mountain Lion, Qt, etc...

        A user can select "all" for metric and platform but we disallow doing both at once since adding
        all metrics on all platforms tends to add way too many charts and hang the browser. I also can't
        think of a use case where you want to look at that many charts at once. We can support this later
        if valid use cases come up.

        * public/index.html:
        (.showCharts.addOption): Extracted.
        (.showCharts): Added "metricList" that shows the list of test and metrics (in the form of
        relative metrics paths such as "DOMWalk:Time") for each top-level test selected in testList.
        metricList has onchange handler that enables/disables items on platformList.
        
        (init): Sort tests and test metrics here instead of doing that in showCharts.

        Note that we don't want to start a new node.js process for each aggregation, so we accumulate all values to be

        <rdar://problem/13151558> SafariPerfMonitor: Tooltip is unusable

        Rubber-stamped by Tim Horton.

        * public/index.html:
        (Chart.attachMainPlot): Disable auto highlighting (circle around a data point that shows up on hover)
        on the dashboard page as it's way too noisy.

        (Chart.hideTooltip): Added. Hides the tooltip that shows up on hover.

        (.toggleClickTooltip): Extracted from the code for "mouseout" bind (now replaced by "mouseleave").
        Pins or unpins a tooltip. When pinning a tooltip, we create a tooltip behind the scene and show that
        so that the tooltip for hover can be reused further.

        (.closestItemForPageX): Find the closest item given pageX. We iterate data points from left to right,
        and find the first point that lies on the right of the cursor position. We then compute the midpoint
        between this and the previous point and pick the closer of the two. It returns an item-like object
        that has all properties we need since flot doesn't provide an API to retrieve the real item object.

        (Chart): Call toggleClickTooltip when a (hover) tooltip is clicked.

        (Chart.attach): In "plothover" bind, call closestItemForPageX when item is not provided by flot on
        the first or "current" data points (as opposed to target or baseline data points).

        Also bind the code to clear crosshair and hide tooltips to "mouseleave" instead of "mouseout", and
        avoid triggering this code when the cursor is still within the plot's rectangle (e.g. when a cursor
        moves onto a tooltip) to avoid the premature dismissal of a tooltip.

        * public/js/helper-classes.js:
        (Tooltip.ensureContainer): Don't automatically close then the user clicks on tooltip. Delegate this
        work to the client via bindClick.

        Make the generation of "runs" JSON dynamic and support test_metrics.

        Reviewed by Mark Rowe.

        It turned out that we can fetch all runs for a given configuration in roughly 100-200ms.

        Since there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of tests for each configuration and users
        aren't necessarily interested in looking at all test results, it's much more efficient to
        generate runs JSON dynamically (i.e. polling) upon a request instead of generating all of them
        when bots report new results (i.e. pushing).

        Rewrote the script to generate runs JSON in php and also supported test_metrics table.
