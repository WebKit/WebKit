      <p>The introduction of Speedometer 3.0 is a major step forward in making the web faster for all, and allowing Web developers to make websites and web apps that were not previously possible. In this article, we explore ways the WebKit team made performance optimizations in WebKit and Safari based on the Speedometer 3.0 benchmark.</p>
      <p>In order to make these improvements, we made an extensive use of our performance testing infrastructure. It’s integrated with our continuous integration, and provides the capability to schedule A/B tests. This allows engineers to quickly test out performance optimizations and catch new performance regressions.</p>

      <p>Apple Vision Pro is here, and with it, a lot of excitement about the possibilities for WebXR in visionOS. Support is in progress, where you can test it today. WebXR now includes a more natural and privacy-preserving method for interaction — the new <code>transient-pointer</code> input mode — available for Safari 17.4 in visionOS 1.1. Let’s explore how natural input for WebXR works, and how to leverage it when developing a WebXR experience for Apple Vision Pro.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15190/implementing-vertical-form-controls/">Implementing Vertical Form Controls</a></h3>
      <p>Setting written text vertically is commonly observed in East Asian languages. For example, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) may be written vertically and read top-to-bottom, flowing in lines from right to left. Similarly, Traditional Mongolian is a vertical script that flows in lines from left to right.</p> 
      <p>Support for vertical text has been available in browsers for several years using the CSS writing-mode property. However, until recently, support for the vertical-lr and vertical-rl values for form controls was inconsistent among all browsers. Consequently, as part of Interop 2023, the industry committed to working towards vertical writing mode support in form controls. We are excited to see cross-browser support improve considerably. And we are proud that Safari 17.4 brings support for vertical writing modes to form controls everywhere you find Safari.</p>

      <p>As announced on browserbench.org today, in collaboration with other browser engine developers, Apple’s WebKit team is excited to introduce Speedometer 3.0, a major update that better reflects the Web of today. It’s built together by the developers of all major browser engines: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit with hundreds of contributions from companies like Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla.</p>

      <p>Switches are a popular control on mobile platforms as well as in a large variety of UI frameworks, but until now they were not built into the web platform. Seeing the widespread need for this control we decided to change that.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/15036/how-to-use-media-source-extensions-with-airplay/">How to use Media Source Extensions with AirPlay</a></h3>
      <p>Media Source Extensions (MSE) is a popular way to provide streaming video on the web. It gives JavaScript control of the way bytes are sent to the browser for playback. At the 2023 Worldwide Developer conference, Apple announced a new Managed Media Source API that improves on MSE with efficient video streaming and longer battery life for iOS and other devices.</p>        
      <p>However, MMS and MSE, by nature, are not compatible with AirPlay, which requires a unique playback URL. AirPlay allows you to start playback of your favorite videos on your phone, move them to your TV and then switch off that phone. An AirPlay-compatible URL can be of any format such as an mp4, mpeg-ts, or HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).</p>        
      <p>This post will guide you through providing both sources and, in the process, build out a demo example.</p>

      <p>The web is amazing. It makes collaborating, learning, and connecting easy for billions of people, because it’s intentionally designed to run on radically different devices.</p>
      <p>It’s your job as a web developer to ensure your project works in every browser and for every user — and that can be hard to do. It’s a far easier undertaking when browsers have identical implementations of the web technology you use.</p>        
      <p>Identical implementations are accomplished through the web standards process, where people collaborate together to write extremely detailed technical documents that define each new web technology — right down to how website bugs should work.</p>

      <p>Profiles are useful. They allow users to organize their data into categories and manage them separately. Users can create different profiles for different purposes and delete any profile without worrying about messing with data from another profile. Profiles also make it easier to access different online identities. Users with multiple accounts on the same site can simultaneously log into them within different profiles. They don’t need to keep logging in and out to switch between accounts because cookies are separate between profiles.</p>

      <p>A website can store data on a user’s device using various storage APIs: localStorage, IndexedDB, File System, etc. It’s an important capability allowing websites to be functional offline with good performance by serving local resources. However, the storage capacity is not unlimited. In fact, it is usually much smaller than a device’s disk size. Bad things could happen when the capacity is full like failed storage operations or data eviction. As a web developer, understanding storage policy helps to avoid these unexpected results. This post will discuss the latest storage policy in WebKit apps including Safari.</p>
