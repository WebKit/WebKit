        <p><strong>Our Founding Fathers’</strong> <em>experiences emphasized the importance they placed on rights and limited government.</em> With few checks on authority, Britain imposed heavy taxes on colonists after the Seven Years War, a change from previous salutary neglect. The colonists’ protests emphasized their preexisting need for individual freedom and limited government.</p>
        <p>As political author Joel Barlow discussed in his 1792 pamphlet “Advice to the Privileged Orders in the Several States of Europe”, the individual cultural mindsets of the colonists defined the rights they demanded from their government. Colonial experiences did not change the Founders’ views as much as it legitimized their belief in individual rights already established during times of salutary neglect.</p>

        <p>In Massachusetts, the colonists faced severe oppression under the Boston Harbor Act and therefore incorporated the idea that &ldquo;all men are born free and equal&rdquo; in Article 1 of their Constitution. British oppression taught the citizens of Massachusetts to value both their natural rights and the ideals in their Constitution, prompting juries to abolish slavery through cases like Bett v. Freeman (1781).</p>
