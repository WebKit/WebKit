    <h1><a href="index.html">Bare Bones Backend</a> / Assembly Intermediate Representation</h1>
    <p>The B3 compiler converts SSA procedures into efficient machine code by first converting
      them to a form that reveals machine details, like registers. This form is called Assembly
      Intermediate Representation, or just Air for short.</p>

    <p>Air is designed around JavaScriptCore's existing MacroAssembler. Air has Inst objects,
      which each describe some method call to the MacroAssembler: an Inst's opcode indicates
      which method name to use and its args indicate the arguments to pass to that method. We
      use code generation to create a massive switch statement that turns the reflective Insts
      into actual calls to MacroAssembler. Consequently, we can "add" new instructions to Air
      usually by just editing the ​AirOpcode.opcodes file.</p>
