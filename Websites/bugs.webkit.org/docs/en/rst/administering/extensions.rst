Installed Extensions
====================

Bugzilla can be enhanced using extensions (see :ref:`extensions`). If an
extension comes with documentation in the appropriate format, and you build
your own copy of the Bugzilla documentation using :file:`makedocs.pl`, then
the documentation for your installed extensions will show up here.

Your Bugzilla installation has the following extensions available (as of the
last time you compiled the documentation):

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
   
   ../extensions/*/index-admin
