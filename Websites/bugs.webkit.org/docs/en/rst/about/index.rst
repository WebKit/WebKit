Evaluating Bugzilla
###################

If you want to try out Bugzilla to see if it meets your needs, you can do so
on `Landfill <https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-4.4-branch/>`_, our test
server. The `Bugzilla FAQ <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:FAQ>`_ may also
be helpful, as it answers a number of questions people sometimes have about
whether Bugzilla is for them.

`reStructured Text

the `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation system. It has
recently been rewritten, so it undoubtedly has bugs. Please file any you find, in

.. _license:

License
#######

Bugzilla is `free <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_ and
`open source <http://opensource.org/osd>`_ software, which means (among other
things) that you can download it, install it, and run it for any purpose
whatsoever without the need for license or payment. Isn't that refreshing?

Bugzilla's code is made available under the
`Mozilla Public License 2.0 <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/>`_ (MPL),
specifically the variant which is Incompatible with Secondary Licenses.
However, again, if you only want to install and run Bugzilla, you don't need
to worry about that; it's only relevant if you redistribute the code or any
changes you make.
