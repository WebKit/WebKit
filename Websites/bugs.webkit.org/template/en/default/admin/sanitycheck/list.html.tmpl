    Bugzilla is checking the referential integrity of your database.
    This may take several minutes to complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    Errors, if any, will be <span class="alert">emphasized like this</span>.
    Depending on the errors found, some links will be displayed allowing you
    to easily fix them. Fixing these errors will automatically run this script
    again (so be aware that it may take an even longer time than the first run).
