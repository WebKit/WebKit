<h2 id="basics">The Basics</h2>

<ul class="qs_help">
  <li>If you just put a word or series of words in the search box, 
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] will search the 
    [%+ field_descs.product FILTER html %],
    [%+ field_descs.component FILTER html %], 
    [%+ IF use_keywords %][%+ field_descs.keywords FILTER html %],[% END %]
    [%+ IF Param('usebugaliases') %][% field_descs.alias FILTER html %],[% END %]
    [%+ field_descs.short_desc FILTER html %], 
    [%+ IF Param('usestatuswhiteboard') %][% field_descs.status_whiteboard FILTER html %],[% END %]
    and [% field_descs.longdesc FILTER html %] fields for your word or words.</li>

  <li>Typing just a <strong>number</strong> in the search box will take
    you directly to the [% terms.bug %] with that ID. 
    [% IF Param('usebugaliases') %]
      Also, just typing the <strong>alias</strong> of [% terms.abug %]
      will take you to that [% terms.bug %].
    [% END %]
  </li>

  <li>Adding more terms <strong>narrows down</strong> the search, it does not
     expand it. (In other words, [% terms.Bugzilla %] searches for 
     [%+ terms.bugs %] that match <em>all</em> your criteria, not
     [%+ terms.bugs %] that match <em>any</em> of your criteria.)</li>

  <li>Searching is <strong>case-insensitive</strong>. So <kbd>table</kbd>,
    <kbd>Table</kbd>, and <kbd>TABLE</kbd> are all the same.</li>

  <li>[% terms.Bugzilla %] does not just search for the exact word you put in,
    but also for any word that <strong>contains</strong> that word.
    So, for example, searching for "cat" would also find [% terms.bugs %]
    that contain it as part of other words&mdash;for example, [% terms.abug %]
    mentioning "<strong>cat</strong>ch" or "certifi<strong>cat</strong>e". It
    will not find partial words in the [% field_descs.longdesc FILTER html %]
    or [% field_descs.keywords FILTER html %] fields,
    though&mdash;only full words are matched, there.</li>

  <li>By default, only <strong>open</strong> [% terms.bugs %] are
    searched. If you want to know how to also search closed [% terms.bugs %],
    see the <a href="#shortcuts">Advanced Shortcuts</a> section.</li>

  <li>If you want to search <strong>specific fields</strong>, you do it like
    <kbd>field:value</kbd>, where <kbd>field</kbd> is one of the 
    <a href="#fields">field names</a> lower down in this
    document and <kbd>value</kbd> is the value you want to search for
    in that field. If you put commas in the <kbd>value</kbd>, then it is
    interpreted as a list of values, and [% terms.bugs %] that match
    <em>any</em> of those values will be searched for.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basic_examples">Examples of Simple Queries</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of how to write some simple queries.
  <a href="#advanced_examples">Examples for more complex queries</a> can be
  found lower in this page.</p>

<ul class="qs_help">
  <li>All open [% terms.bugs %] where userA@company.com is in the CC list
    (no need to mention open [% terms.bugs %], this is the default):<br>
    <kbd>cc:userA@company.com</kbd></li>
  <li>All unconfirmed [% terms.bugs %] in product productA (putting the
    [%+ terms.bug %] status at the first position make it being automagically
    considered as [% terms.abug %] status):<br>
    <kbd>UNCONFIRMED product:productA</kbd>
  <li>All open and closed [% terms.bugs %] reported by userB@company.com
    (we must specify ALL as the first word, else only open [% terms.bugs %]
    are taken into account):<br>
    <kbd>ALL reporter:userB@company.com</kbd>
  <li>All open [% terms.bugs %] with severity blocker or critical with the
    target milestone set to 2.5:<br>
    <kbd>severity:blocker,critical milestone:2.5</kbd>
  <li>All open [% terms.bugs %] in the component Research & Development
    with priority P1 or P2 (we must use quotes for the component as its name
    contains whitespaces):<br>
    <kbd>component:"Research & Development" priority:P1,P2</kbd></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fields">Fields You Can Search On</h2>

<p>You can specify any of these fields like <kbd>field:value</kbd>
  in the search box, to search on them. You can also abbreviate
  the field name, as long as your abbreviation matches only one field name.
  So, for example, searching on <kbd>stat:VERIFIED</kbd> will find all
  [%+ terms.bugs %] in the <kbd>VERIFIED</kbd> status. Some fields have
  multiple names, and you can use any of those names to search for them.</p>

[% IF Bugzilla.active_custom_fields.size %]
  [% SET first_field = Bugzilla.active_custom_fields.0 %]
  <p>For custom fields, they can be used and abbreviated
    based on the part of their name <em>after</em> the <kbd>cf_</kbd>
    if you'd like, in addition to their standard name starting with
    <kbd>cf_</kbd>. So for example, 
    <kbd>[% first_field.name FILTER html %]</kbd> can be
    referred to as 
    <kbd>[% first_field.name.replace('^cf_') FILTER html %]</kbd>,
    also. However, if this causes a conflict between the standard
    [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] field names and the custom field names, the
    standard field names always take precedence.</p>

<h2 id="advanced_features">Advanced Features</h2>

<ul class="qs_help">
  <li>If you want to search for a <strong>phrase</strong> or something that
    contains spaces, commas, colons or quotes, you must put it in quotes, like:
    <kbd>"yes, this is a phrase"</kbd>. You must also use quotes to search for
    characters that would otherwise be interpreted specially by quicksearch.
    For example, <kbd>"this|that"</kbd> would search for the literal string
    <em>this|that</em> and would not be parsed as <kbd>"this OR that"</kbd>.
    Also, <kbd>"-field:value"</kbd> would search for the literal phrase
    <em>-field:value</em> and would not be parsed as
    <kbd>"NOT field:value"</kbd>.</li>

  <li>You can use <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>,
    and <strong>OR</strong> in searches. 

    You can also use <kbd>-</kbd> to mean "NOT", and <kbd>|</kbd> to mean "OR".
    There is no special character for "AND", because by default any search
    terms that are separated by a space are joined by an "AND".
    Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>NOT</strong>:<br>
        Use <kbd><strong>-</strong><em>summary:foo</em></kbd> to exclude 
        [%+ terms.bugs %] with <kbd>foo</kbd> in the summary.<br>
        <kbd><em>NOT summary:foo</em></kbd> would have the same effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AND</strong>:<br>
        <kbd><em>foo bar</em></kbd> searches for [% terms.bugs %] that contains
        both <kbd>foo</kbd> and <kbd>bar</kbd>.<br>
        <kbd><em>foo AND bar</em></kbd> would have the same effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OR</strong>:<br>
        <kbd><em>foo<strong>|</strong>bar</em></kbd> would search
        for [% terms.bugs %] that contain <kbd>foo</kbd> OR <kbd>bar</kbd>.<br>
        <kbd><em>foo OR bar</em></kbd> would have the same effect.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You cannot use | nor OR to enumerate possible values for a given field.
      You must use commas instead. So <kbd>field:value1,value2</kbd> does what
      you expect, but <kbd>field:value1|value2</kbd> would be treated as
      <kbd>field:value1 OR value2</kbd>, which means value2 is not bound to
      the given field.</p>

    <p>OR has higher precedence than AND; AND is the top level operation.
      For example:</p>
    <p>Searching for <em><kbd>url|location bar|field -focus</kbd></em> means
      (<kbd>url</kbd> OR <kbd>location</kbd>) AND (<kbd>bar</kbd> OR 
      <kbd>field</kbd>) AND (NOT <kbd>focus</kbd>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shortcuts">Advanced Shortcuts</h2>

<p>In addition to using <a href="#fields">field names</a> to search
  specific fields, there are certain characters or words that you can
  use as a "shortcut" for searching certain fields:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" class="qs_fields">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="field_name">[% field_descs.bug_status FILTER html %]</td>
      <td class="field_nickname">
        Make the <strong>first word</strong> of your search the name of any
        status, or even an abbreviation of any status, and [% terms.bugs %]
        in that status will be searched. <strong><kbd>ALL</kbd></strong>
        is a special shortcut that means "all statuses".
        <strong><kbd>OPEN</kbd></strong> is a special shortcut that means
        "all open statuses".
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="field_name">[% field_descs.resolution FILTER html %]</td>
      <td class="field_nickname">

        resolution, or even an abbreviation of any resolution, and 
        [%+ terms.bugs %] with that resolution will be searched. For example,
        making <kbd>FIX</kbd> the first word of your search will find all

        "P2" means the second-highest priority, and so on.
        <p>Searching for "<strong>P1-3</strong>" will find [% terms.bugs %] in

  <a href="query.cgi?format=advanced">Advanced Search</a> form.</p>

<ul class="qs_help">

  <li>All open [% terms.bugs %] in product productA with either severity
    blocker, critical or major, or with priority P1, or with the blocker+
    flag set, and which are neither assigned to userB@company.com nor to
    userC@company.com (we make the assumption that there are only two users
    matching userB and userC, else we would write the whole login name):<br>
