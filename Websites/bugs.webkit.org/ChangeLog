        If you discard a comment that has a corresponding previousComment,

        time you added a comment by clicking on the previousComment, we
        would get undefined as the start line for the new comment.

        All of this works fine until you try to restore the comment from

        line is undefined.

        Review tool should work well on iPad
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58351

        On the iPad, the toolbar ends up at some random position in the middle
        of the page because of how position:fixed interacts with scrolling on
        the iPad.  I feel a bit dirty using a user agent detect, but I'm not
        sure if there's a better way to detect whether the user agent has this
        behavior.

        add container divs for diff blocks

        This will help simplify a lot of code in code-review.js
        and make side-by-side diffs better (i.e. put removed lines
        to the left of corresponding added lines).

        Also, allow for running the JS from a local file. Now you can modify code-review.js
        to point to a local file and then run:
        ruby prettify.rb < foo.diff > foo.html

        foo.html will load a dummy code review matching foo.diff.

        Support for conversion from the formatted diff to a side-by-side diff.
        Maintains comments and new comments can be added.

        The main architectural change is that Line elements are no longer necessarily
        siblings. Each physical line is now in a LineContainer and LineContainers are
        siblings. Each Line corresponds to a Line in the unified diff and has an id (e.g. line12).
        A Line can be a LineContainer or a child of a LineContainer.

        In this way, converting to side-by-side and, in the future, back to unified is non-lossy.

        In the future, we can consider adding the upload svn revision

        This patch adds drop down menus for adjusting the review and
        commit-queue flags from the main review screen.  These controls don't
        appear immediately because we need to read the state of the flags off
        the details page.

        It's a slight sadness that bugzilla doesn't have a clean way of
        identifying which select control is associated with a given flag.  The
        flags seem to have some sort of id, but it's unclear to me how to map
        that id back to a notion of "review" or "commit-queue".  Instead, we
        look for some magic strings in the title.  I'm sure this will come back
        to bit us at some point, but I'm not sure what to do that's better.
        (The webkitpy solution to this problem is to assume that the flags are
        in a given order, but this seems better.)

        bugs.webkit.org should autocomplete WebKit Committers and Reviewers

        This patch implements an autocomplete dropdown that helps users type

        [reviewtool] Add a field for overall comments
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45273

        This patch does a couple logically separate things that could be
        separated into smaller patches:

        1) This patch adds an "overall comments" field where you can enter
           overall comments about the patch.  These comments appear at the top
           of the bugzilla posting.  Currently, these aren't redisplayed when
           viewing the patch, but I plan to add that in a future patch.

        2) This patch renames some of the CSS classes to more consistently
           follow the camelCase style that PrettyPatch uses.

        3) This patch moves the "prepare comments" button to the left of the
           toolbar and renames is to "publish comments".  This makes more sense
           when you scroll to the bottom of the page and enter in some overall
           comments.

        4) When you attempt to add a comment to a line that already has a
           "frozen" comment, we now unfreeze the comment instead of doing
           nothing.  The old behavior was kind of frustrating if you didn't
           know that you could unfreeze a comment by clicking on it.

        Many folks (including myself) are too trigger-happy with the "delete"
        button that we end up deleting perfectly good review comments.  This
        patch adds an "ok" button to absorb these clicks (and renames "delete"
        to "cancel").  When you click the ok button, the comment becomes
        non-editable and the box shrinks to fit the text.  You can click the
        text to get back to the editable version.

        Combine :equal operations with the following operation if they are
        fewer than 3 characters long

        This keeps us from showing lots of small changes on long lines, just
        because some letters happened to be the same.

        Inspired by
        http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/source/browse/trunk/reviewboard/diffviewer/diffutils.py?r=1264#147

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Remove :equal operations fewer
        than 3 characters long. The characters from the removed operations
        become part of the subsequent operation.
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Don't wrap 0-length strings in
        <ins>/<del> tags. Also removed the @fromLineNumber.nil? and
        @toLineNumber.nil? checks as they are no longer reliable now that
        we're removing operations.

2008-04-08  Adam Roben  <aroben@apple.com>

        Change PrettyPatch to use DiffBuilder for intra-line diffs

        This gives us much prettier intra-line diffs, largely because it can
        distinguish multiple changes on the same line. e.g., if a line changes
        from:

        const int myConstant = 0;

        to

        static const unsigned myConstant;

        You will see that "static " was inserted, "int" changed to "unsigned",
        and " = 0" was deleted.

        This seems to have also gotten rid of some spurious instances of
        "<ins></ins>" and "<del></del>" at the end of a line.

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Use DiffBuilder instead of
        setChangeExtentFromLine (which had been copied from Trac's diffing
        code).
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine):
         - Removed the changeExtent attribute
         - Added the operations attribute
         - Removed the setChangeExtentFromLine method
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Uses @operations to determine
        what text to wrap in <ins> and <del> tags.
        * PrettyPatch/diff.rb: Deleted a bunch of code we don't use.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.initialize): Moved code here from the old build
        method, but left out the calls to perform_operation, since we build
        the diff HTML outside of this class.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.split_inputs_to_words): Removed calls to
        convert_html_to_list_of_words, since we're not diffing HTML.
