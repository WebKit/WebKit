        Adds a new Bugzilla extension that will automatically CC the EWS feeder queue

        (new): Initialize some bookkeeping variables we use to track whether we have seen
        a value change event for the review flag and whether we need to CC the feeder. The latter
        we need to track because we can only make changes to the CC list in the callback
        bug_start_of_update().
        (object_before_set): This callback is called each time a setter is called on a Bugzilla
        object. Check if the review flag was set to ? and do some bookkeeping. Although tempting
        to do such work in the callback flag_end_of_update() instead of object_before_set() doing
        such work would come AFTER we get callback bug_start_of_update() and hence after we have
        committed the CC list of the bug to the database. Moreover, the "interface to [flag_end_of_update()]
        is UNSTABLE and it may change in the future" according to <https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/blob/d7cf1c91949248222806f5a32f485b12eab8806f/Bugzilla/Hook.pm#L797>.

        While we do post message to determine the size, the fact that we have

        is not returned. Although we solve this artifical constraint problem
        inside of the bubble containerMetrics measuring, up this default value
        from 450 to 460 to reduce UI jitter (the current measurement on my

        REGRESSION: code-review-tests.html fails with error "Received an error at line 214"

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Fixes an issue where opening the file code-review-test.html in Safari shows the error message
        "FAIL: Received an error at line 214" and in the console there is a JavaScript TypeError:
            undefined is not an object (evaluating '$('.overallComments textarea').val().trim')

        Notice that test testReaddDiscardedCommentWithPreviousComment() is the only test that appends
        the toolbar, which inserts the overall comments textarea. The test testSaveCommentsWithMissingLineIds()
        assumes that the own properties of the window object are enumerated in the same order as they
        were defined in the file code-review-test.html such that the test testReaddDiscardedCommentWithPreviousComment()
        is executed before test testSaveCommentsWithMissingLineIds(). The behavior of JavaScriptCore with
        respect to the enumeration order of properties on the window object have changed since the
        test testSaveCommentsWithMissingLineIds() was written such that the order of the own properties
        on the window object do not reflect the order in which they were defined in the file. We should
        append the toolbar before running the tests and explicitly execute the tests in chosen order so
        as to be able to reason of the test results regardless of the enumeration ordering of the
        properties in the DOM window object.

        Also, removed duplicate 'd' in the name of function "testReaddDiscardedCommentWithPreviousComment"
        such that it reads "testReadDiscardedCommentWithPreviousComment".

        in the git source file diff.c (https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/diff.c).

        When determining if a binary file patch is an image or not we should accept
        both literal and delta patch encodings.

        When reconstructing the images from the patches, if we have a delta patch
        we may download the previous revision from svn.webkit.org to get the image data.

        Support for conversion from the formatted diff to a side-by-side diff.
        Maintains comments and new comments can be added.

        The main architectural change is that Line elements are no longer necessarily
        siblings. Each physical line is now in a LineContainer and LineContainers are
        siblings. Each Line corresponds to a Line in the unified diff and has an id (e.g. line12).
        A Line can be a LineContainer or a child of a LineContainer.

        In this way, converting to side-by-side and, in the future, back to unified is non-lossy.

        [reviewtool] Allow setting review and commit-queue flags from main review screen
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45860

        This patch adds drop down menus for adjusting the review and
        commit-queue flags from the main review screen.  These controls don't
        appear immediately because we need to read the state of the flags off
        the details page.

        It's a slight sadness that bugzilla doesn't have a clean way of
        identifying which select control is associated with a given flag.  The
        flags seem to have some sort of id, but it's unclear to me how to map
        that id back to a notion of "review" or "commit-queue".  Instead, we
        look for some magic strings in the title.  I'm sure this will come back
        to bit us at some point, but I'm not sure what to do that's better.
        (The webkitpy solution to this problem is to assume that the flags are
        in a given order, but this seems better.)

        [reviewtool] Add a field for overall comments
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45273

        This patch does a couple logically separate things that could be
        separated into smaller patches:

        1) This patch adds an "overall comments" field where you can enter
           overall comments about the patch.  These comments appear at the top
           of the bugzilla posting.  Currently, these aren't redisplayed when
           viewing the patch, but I plan to add that in a future patch.

        2) This patch renames some of the CSS classes to more consistently
           follow the camelCase style that PrettyPatch uses.

        3) This patch moves the "prepare comments" button to the left of the
           toolbar and renames is to "publish comments".  This makes more sense
           when you scroll to the bottom of the page and enter in some overall
           comments.

        4) When you attempt to add a comment to a line that already has a
           "frozen" comment, we now unfreeze the comment instead of doing
           nothing.  The old behavior was kind of frustrating if you didn't
           know that you could unfreeze a comment by clicking on it.

        to "cancel").  When you click the ok button, the comment becomes
        non-editable and the box shrinks to fit the text.  You can click the
        text to get back to the editable version.

        Hack up PrettyDiff to allow line-by-line comments
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37886

        Admittedly a bit of a hack, this is a basic line-by-line editor we can
        play with thanks to Andrew Scherkus.  It's meant to integrate with the
        "review" page at bugs.webkit.org.

        I changed a few things from Andrew's original version:
        1) Trigger text boxes on single click to make iPhone/iPad reviewing
        easier.
        2) Clear the main text box on load.
        3) Reference a version of prototype.js on bugs.webkit.org.

        There's a risk of reseting a valid assignee for example when

        not cause problems for people relying on this functionality.

        This keeps us from showing lots of small changes on long lines, just
        because some letters happened to be the same.

        Inspired by
        http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/source/browse/trunk/reviewboard/diffviewer/diffutils.py?r=1264#147

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Remove :equal operations fewer
        than 3 characters long. The characters from the removed operations
        become part of the subsequent operation.
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Don't wrap 0-length strings in
        <ins>/<del> tags. Also removed the @fromLineNumber.nil? and
        @toLineNumber.nil? checks as they are no longer reliable now that
        we're removing operations.

        Change PrettyPatch to use DiffBuilder for intra-line diffs

        This gives us much prettier intra-line diffs, largely because it can
        distinguish multiple changes on the same line. e.g., if a line changes
        from:

        const int myConstant = 0;

        to

        static const unsigned myConstant;

        You will see that "static " was inserted, "int" changed to "unsigned",
        and " = 0" was deleted.

        This seems to have also gotten rid of some spurious instances of
        "<ins></ins>" and "<del></del>" at the end of a line.

        * PrettyPatch/PrettyPatch.rb:
        (PrettyPatch::DiffSection.initialize): Use DiffBuilder instead of
        setChangeExtentFromLine (which had been copied from Trac's diffing
        code).
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine):
         - Removed the changeExtent attribute
         - Added the operations attribute
         - Removed the setChangeExtentFromLine method
        (PrettyPatch::CodeLine.text_as_html): Uses @operations to determine
        what text to wrap in <ins> and <del> tags.
        * PrettyPatch/diff.rb: Deleted a bunch of code we don't use.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.initialize): Moved code here from the old build
        method, but left out the calls to perform_operation, since we build
        the diff HTML outside of this class.
        (HTMLDiff::DiffBuilder.split_inputs_to_words): Removed calls to
        convert_html_to_list_of_words, since we're not diffing HTML.
