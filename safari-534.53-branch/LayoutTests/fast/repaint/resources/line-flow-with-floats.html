    The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
    flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
    comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,
    but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
    out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
    <i id="would">would</i> twist itself round and look up in her face, with
    such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
    laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to
    <span id="yellowFloat" style="display: none; float: right; width: 3em; height: 3em; margin: 0.2em 0 0.2em 0.2em; background: lightYellow;"></span>
    begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had
    unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
    this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever
    she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up
    soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of
    the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
    <span id="blueFloat" style="float: left; width: 3em; height: 4em; margin: 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0; background: lightblue; text-align: center;"></span>
    difficult game indeed.
    <br>
    The players all played at once without waiting
    <span id="greenFloat" style="float: right; width: 3em; height: 5em; margin: 0.2em 0 0.2em 0.2em; background: lightgreen;"></span>
    for turns,
    quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
    a very short time <span id="theQueen">the Queen</span> was in a furious passion, and went
    stamping about, and shouting &lsquo;Off with his head!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Off with
    her head!&rsquo; about once in a minute.
    <br>
    Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as
    yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might
    happen any minute, &lsquo;and then,&rsquo; thought she, &lsquo;what would become of
    me? They&rsquo;re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great
    wonder is, that there&lsquo;s any one left alive!&rsquo;
