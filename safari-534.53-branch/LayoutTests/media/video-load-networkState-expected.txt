Test that setting src to an invalid url triggers load(), which sets networkState to NETWORK_NO_SOURCE. Setting src to a valid url should then trigger the loading events and end up with networkState >= NETWORK_LOADING.


EXPECTED (video.networkState == '0') OK
RUN(video.src = 'bogus/movie.mpg')
EVENT(loadstart)
EXPECTED (video.networkState == '3') OK

EVENT(loadstart)
EVENT(loadedmetadata)
EVENT(loadeddata)
EVENT(canplay)
EVENT(canplaythrough)
EXPECTED (video.networkState >= '1') OK
END OF TEST
