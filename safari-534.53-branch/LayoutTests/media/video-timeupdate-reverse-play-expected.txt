Tests that a 'timeupdate' event is fired when a movie plays
in reverse to time zero.

EVENT(canplaythrough)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == '0') OK
RUN(video.currentTime = 0.3)

EVENT(seeked)
EXPECTED (video.currentTime.toFixed(1) == '0.3') OK
RUN(video.play())
RUN(video.playbackRate = -1)

EVENT(timeupdate) fired at time 0
EXPECTED (video.ended == 'false') OK

END OF TEST
